Sr Nancy Dufton was born
27 Octr 1790, at Wellhouse, where
she remained with her parents,
till her Fathers' death, which
was thought to be from the
effects of an accident by with a gun,
for though he lived some time
after he suffered from the consequences
When about 7 years old she
came with her mother to reside
at Bankhouse near Fulneck, where
she lived many years, & for 10
Years of that time called for the
annual cleaning of the Chapel.
about the year 1839 she came
to live in Fulneck, & then began
to sweep the Chapel regularly,


as service, which she attended to
most faithfully, till age. & infirmity
obliged his most reluctantly to relinquish
getting her daughter, who waited
faithfully upon her, to perform
that duty for her.
When she became a communicant
member of the Congn we do not
know, but it must have been
above 40 years ago.
During her long life she was
very useful in many ways,
among the rest in assisting the
late Sr Mary Emmerson in waiting
upon the sick from the schools.
For a member of years she
waited most faithfully upon
the late Sr. Thomas Mallabew &


her family, as service which they
have always acknowledged, & was
kindly rewarded, by helping her
in many ways in her old age,
her thankfulness for which she
often expressed with much gratitude
for the last year or two her
strength has gradually failed,
but this was not to be wondered
at, considering her great age.
She was not however confined to
her bed, on even to the house till
a few months back. It soon
seemed evident, that her time
here below could not be much longer,
& we feel assured that she humbly &
earnestly looked to our Saviour, to
prepare her for the great change


which she could not but but feel was
rapidly approaching. She never saw
very much about her state of mind, but
when asked how she felt in the prospect of
her departure, she always expressed a
strong hope, that the Lord would have
mercy upon her, & prepare her for going
home to Him, -- saying that her only
trust was in Him & his atonement.
When a friend said to her that the hoped
she trusted in nothing in herself, but only
in Jesus, -- she exclaimed. "What have I
to trust in but my Saviour! O! I trust
He will have mercy on me a poor
sinner! I have no other trust."
In The morning just evening before she departed her son in
law said  asked her if she was wishing the
Lord to take her-- "Yes, she said, & soon."
For a few hours she seemed to sleep comfortably
but about 2 o'clock on Saturday morning a
change took place, & shortly after 6 o'clock
she departed most gently, just as if she was
falling asleep. & we believe the did fall asleep
in Jesus & is now enjoying rest with him.
Her age was 80 years & 7 months.
