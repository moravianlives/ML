    <h2>Charles Henry Conrad Von Larisch</h2>
    <h2>1</h2>
    <p><a href="#mlpla000231.html">Lindsey House</a><em>Nov<sup>r</sup> 1<sup>st</sup> 1754</em>.</p>
    <p> After the remains of our dear B<sup>r</sup><a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000539.html">Larish</a> were interr'd, the B<sup>rn</sup> &amp;
        S<sup>rs</sup><br />(among whom where many from <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>) met in the Family Hall <br /> in <a href="#mlpla000231.html">Lindsey House</a> and then was Sung that
      Hymn: O Head so full of <br />Bruises &amp; After which the <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000566.html">Disciple</a> spoke in English as follows. </p>
    <p> I have but a few words to say on this Occasion, the Liturgy of to <br /> Day belongs to the Evening when our Saviour went from us, the pre <br /> sent Day has besides that, the particular
      character of all Saints, &amp; that <br /> gives me a handle to speak something of the Saints, &amp; of the nature of a Saint. <br /> 'Tis a name quite common in the Bible, and if we hear of a
      good Man <br /> who left the World 2, or 300 Years ago, then we have not much against <br /> his appearing in that Character, and are not shock'd by it, <br /> but the Ideas we have form'd to
      ourselves of a Saint are such, that <br /> in the Romish Church itself no body can be called so, till 1000 <br /> Years after his Departure. The reason is because one fears, <br /> if any one
      should remain who had seen that Man or <br /> Woman he would Controul his Sanctity, he would <br /> say something that would lesson his Opinion of his Wor- <br />thiness. I am sure one is
      greatly mistaken in this Respect, <br /> but as we are calld to promote the Sinnership we <br /> are not so Curious to receive that Name, Saint, we <br /> care not if that Charactor should be
      heard of no more <br /> but for all that I would not have it, that we shou'd <br /> loose the meaning of the Thing together with the name <br /> Title &amp; Charactor, &amp; should we prove
      careless in that point <br /> I Fear we should be deprived of a great Charactor in the Gos- <br /> pel Train. A Saint in my Opinion is a Christian, <br /> who thinks very little, who perhaps may
      be oblig'd to think</p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> think of many things on Account of his Business &amp; of his <br /> Office, but when I say he thinks not much, I mean that he <br /> does not care to think much, according to the Inclination
      <br /> of his Heart. You will scarcely find a Saint among the great <br /> Men, the Rich &amp; learn'd Men, perhaps not among the Gen <br /> try, or what one calls an easy Person in this World,
      the rea <br /> son is, because all such charge themselves with too ma <br /> ny Superfluities, while the necessary condition of becoming <br /> a Saint, is not to have a great Store of Idle
      &amp; unnecessa <br /> ry things about him. Simplicity &amp; plainness is the Distin <br /> guishing, mark of a Saint. I confess that if a Person <br /> of that Character, happens to want
      Education &amp; of <br /> Course what one calls all manner of required Qualities <br /> hath absolutely not so much notion of the World, as <br /> to deal in an ordinary Way, in a regular Way,
      then the <br /> Sanctity of such a Man, may not comand that Honour <br /> that Awe, that Reverence which is due to it as long as he <br /> lives, &amp; it Seems therefore, that I should be
      afraid to tell <br /> you now by way of Discourse, what I have already Sung <br /> of my B<sup>r</sup><a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000539.html"
        >Larish</a>, whom I always thought a Saint &amp; <br /> I beleive there are 100 in the Cattalouge on Dypticks of old, <br /> who were by far not his paramounts, not like him, nor so <br />
      much of a Saint as He. He was a Person void of all <br /> manner of Education, he had been neglected in all the <br /> Necessary things of this Life, &amp; after having found the <br /> Secret,
      to make himself to be forgotten in this World, after having</p>
    <p> having placed himself behind the Congregation at <a href="#mlpla000001.html">Hhuth</a>, in <br /> order to lead a Simple Civil Life, &amp; absolutely not regard <br /> ed by any one, which he
      contriv'd so out of a true Humility, <br /> for He was a Lord, &amp; had then many Subjects, &amp; a great <br /> Territory of his own. When he was in that Situation <br /> he came hither, and
      met with one of the most Difficult <br /> Tasks which can be imagin'd, nevertheless he atcheiv'd &amp; per <br /> formd it with such surprising Simplicity &amp; wisdom, that <br /> I cant help
      owning once more, that I should have been <br />embarrass'd in the highest degree to do the like: And I must add <br /> that if after my Decease one would compare me to that great <br /> Man,
      &amp; my Conduct to his many Personal Circumstances, as <br /> well as real Intricacies, which would be too long to relate <br /> here (the Saviour knows them, &amp; part of us are not Ignorant
      <br /> thereof,) it would be mere Courtesey. B<sup>r</sup>.<a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000539.html">Larish</a> fullfill'd <br /> his Task with Honour,
      &amp; has not left one leaf of his Book <br /> unfinish'd. His end was like to that of all truly great Men, a <br /> little while before he had not the least thought of going home <br /> he was
      Sick, &amp; a very long time knew his case almost incurable <br /> but drew no Consequence from it for in approaching Dissolution. <br /> When he was acquainted of the Turn his Sickness had
      taken <br /> &amp; of the approaching Dissolution, 'twas very well, 'twas <br /> all the same to him. Those Days passed away in the same <br /> Strain as the foregoing. He treated that awful
      matter as simple <br /> Natural &amp; unconcerndly fill the last gasp as usual, that <br /> none of the Heroes of this world, nore of the great Geniuses <br /> needed to be asham'd of the same
      Exit, Considering the thing in itself</p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    
    <p> itself &amp; without that difference, which makes his case so <br /> much happier than theirs, as for that, He will never <br /> change his Exit for that of any Hero of this World, of <br />
      any great man or Philosopher whatsoever that is quite <br /> out of Question, all I have to say on that part is, <br /> that he departed this Life like a Hero. </p>
    <p> Every one enabled from above to see the hidden Side <br /> of things, their real Charactor to extricate the real <br /> point out of appearances, will never Contradict my opinion, <br />about
      his abode here, having been like his Departure <br /> I wishwith all my Heart, that so many brave B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; S<sup>rs</sup><br />so many wise ones so many well Educated, so many truly
      <br /> learned ones. And which is the best of all so many of our <br /> Sinnerlike good People may obtain. </p>
    <p> His Natural &amp; Simple Charactor that they who <br /> had not the good fortune to have known him personally <br /> may be encouraged thereto by his pretty End. </p>
    <p> What I have said is only Introductory to that little <br /> Hymn which I have Compos'd on his Account &amp; which <br /> perhaps will be Translated. </p>
    <p>Next follows some Account of his Life &amp; Departure<br /> Our dear B<sup>r</sup> <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000539.html">Charles Henry Conrad von
        Larish</a>, was born <br /><em>Sept 22<sup>nd</sup> 1711</em> in <a href="#mlpla000257.html">Gradenwiz near Cosel in upper Silesia</a>. He <br /> was descended from the Ancient Famous Family
      of the Courts<br /> &amp; Lords of <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37482094.html">Larish</a>, also of the Lineage of great <a href=".html">Nimsdorff</a><br /><sup>one</sup> of whom, in
      the Service of our Sav<sup>r</sup> is already a grain of what</p>
    <p> Wheat in <a href="#mlpla000433.html">Surinam</a>. He inherited from his parents the Lord- <br /> ships of Shossloehiz Lomniz Zonade &amp; Rodewiz. In his <br />tender Youth he became
      acquainted with <a href=".html">Abbot Steinmez</a> &amp; o- <br /> ther Servants of <a href=".html">God</a>, by means of the well known great Just <br /> ness awakening, &amp; he was concern'd
      about his Salvation very <br /> much, this continued for some time, &amp; on this account he staid a- <br /> while in <del>Neustad</del><sup>Mandel</sup> with <a href=".html">Abbot
      Steinmetz</a>, was at Werningrode <br /> Halle &amp; other Places, where he thought perhaps he might get a <br />Blessingfor his Heart. Since <em>1731</em> he has been acquainted <br /> with the
        B<sup>rn</sup> as well in <a href="#mlpla000354.html">Jena</a> as in other Places &amp; came <br /> from time to time to Visit the Cong<sup>n</sup> in <a href="#mlpla000001.html">Hhuth</a>,
      where the <br />Sav<sup>r</sup> came ever nearer to his Heart. He found no true rest<br /> from all his good Performance, nor was delivered from his An <br /> xiety till he resolv'd in the Year
        <em>1739</em> to become the intire <br /> Reward of the Smart of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>, at the same time he got <br /> a Conviction to let every thing be as it was, &amp; to betake him-
      <br /> self to the Cong<sup>n</sup> to stay there; accordingly he did so, with <br /> a true Blessingfor his Heart, &amp; he had at that time true- <br /> ly blessed times for his Heart with the
      Single Br<sup>n</sup> assist- <br /> ed also quite faithfully in Building their Choir House<br /> there. He was also soon received into the Cong<sup>n</sup> &amp; partook <br /> of the Corps
      &amp; Blood of <a href=".html">Jesus</a> in the Sacrament with <br /> the Cong<sup>n</sup>.</p>
    <p> In <em>May 1742</em>, He came over to <a href="#mlpla000072.html">Engl.</a> were he staid for some <br /> time especially in <a href="#mlpla000084.html">Yorks<sup>hire</sup></a> &amp; was
      edifying to the Cong<sup>n</sup> in his <br />Servants office in the Hall which he perform'd very faith- fully</p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    
    <p> faithfully &amp; with his whole Heartfrom thence he returned in com- <br /> pany with the <a href="#mlper000566.html">Dr Disciple</a> &amp; <a href="#mlper000213.html">Mother</a> to <a

      <br /> sings afterwards he made Several Journeys to <a href="#mlpla000001.html">Hhuth</a> &amp; <br /><a href="#mlpla000014.html">Hhaag</a>, in <em>this Year</em> also he visited his Lordships
      &amp; found him- <br /> self not only not in a Capacity to execute what he had in- <br /> tended, but found also such an Entanglement in his worldly <br /> Affairs, that he thought it best to
      sell his Estates, to pay <br /> he Debts, &amp; to give the rest to the Diaconate of the Unity <br /> which at that time was much streighten'd, for wch in the <br /> Year <em>1740</em> the New
      House calld <a href=".html">Lichtenburg</a> was made over to <br /> him &amp; fitted up, but because his comfort did not like to tarry <br /> at <a href="#mlpla000014.html">Hhaag</a>, he went
      with her first to <a href="#mlpla000150.html">Zeyst</a> &amp; in the last <br /> Year again to <a href="#mlpla000072.html">Engl</a>; &amp; enjoyed by his abode in each Place of <br /> those
        Cong<sup>ns</sup> much Grace &amp; Blessingsfor his Heart, &amp; all <br /> the B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; S<sup>rs</sup>lov'd him, he had a longer attachment &amp; faithful <br />Heartfull of love
      to our Sav<sup>r</sup> &amp; his Cong<sup>n</sup> &amp; amidst the va- <br /> rious Circumstances w<sup>ch</sup> his weak constitution mostly occasi- <br /> ond. He was never put off from his
      point, but his Heart al- <br /> wayslong'd after him, whom he can now see bodily &amp; kiss his <br /> Wounds. </p>
    <p> The latter Years of his mortal Life he was very Sickly &amp; had <br /> many disorders in his Body, but especially since the Winter <br /><em>53</em> yet as long as it was possible he came to
      the Opportunities <br /> in the Disciples House very diligently &amp; with great Chearfull-ness</p>
    <p>=ness. According to the Nature of His Disease and frequent casaul <br /> ties of all sorts He thought nothing at first of going home, till just <br /> after his Birthday this year when the
      Watchword was untill the <br /> glance extend throughout &amp; then he came upon it very happily<br /> himself, and he was heard to say when by <del>by</del> himself, to our <br />Saviour: My
      Dear Saviour be thou my all in all &amp; round a- <br /> bout me, I am indeed weak, but thou knowest well how to make <br /> it better, and he said: I am indeed spent or very weak, but I <br />
      shall soon go into the Regions of health. Another time, when <br /> he was in great pain he comforted himself with the sufferings<br /> of our Saviour, &amp; rejoiced at the sweet hour of his
      release, &amp; <br /> only wish'd that our Saviour wo'd take him to himself in <br /> sleep. As he pressd very much to have all his Temporal affairs <br /> concerning him and his regulated while
      he was here, therefore <br /> the Synodal Conclusion of <em>1753</em>, was thro' the interposition <br /> of the Disciples House but a few days before his end in <br /> the name of our <a
        href=".html">God</a> brought into the form customary <br /> here, and tho' all the necessary forms are yet wanting from both <br /> the Married parties, yet the Deed is delivered to the
      satisfac- <br /> tion of all sides. <em>Oct 26</em> He got a new disorder &amp; said: that now <br /> he was ready to waite for the last kiss, when the Brn at his <br />desire sung him some
      verses he rejoyced and said O that <br /> has strengthned me, &amp; so continued in continual thought <br /> of going home till the <em>28 of Octo<sup>r</sup> </em>when he said: to this Ser-
      <br /> vant Bro<sup>r</sup><a href=".html">Summerskill</a>, this Ev'ning or Tomorrow <br /> morning the expected hour will <sup>come</sup> &amp; often asked, is it not yet <br /> time he sent
      also 2 or 3 times in the night for B<sup>r</sup><a href=".html">Johan</a>to</p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    
   <p>mupon the Heart, he said; o yes, and to that Verse and <br /> when thy Mouth expiring

    <p><em>Oct 29<sup>th</sup></em> Towards Morning he took leave of his Wife and said: <br />My dear I kiss thee on thy Heart, here I have been thy Hus <br /> band and thy Heart, we was both one Body
      but now no <br /> more, I an going to our dear Saviour and shall expect <br /> thee with my Bridegroom with Joy: Afterwards he <br /> said to B<sup>r</sup><a href=".html">Summerskill</a> and his
      Wife, my dear Children for <br /> give me every thing and I thank you for all the Love and <br /> faithfulness that you shew'd me here and the B<sup>rn</sup> will think <br /> on you for it,
      thereupon he said to his Maid (who is no <br />Sister) adue I thank you also for all you have done for me, I <br />wish you well in the World, about Six o'Clock in the <br /> Morning he
        desiredBrother<a href=".html">John<sup>s</sup></a> to be called <br /> again, because he was very weak but re- <br /> cover'd himself as soon as he saw him w<sup>ch</sup><br /> he did several
      times before; The rest of the <br /> Time he was mostly as if he was a- <br /> sleep, &amp; had thereby sometimes such an <br /> extraordinary lovely &amp; smiling look <br /> that the eyes of
      the Brethren &amp; Sisters<br /> round about him overflowed. <a href=".html">Hutton</a><br /> said once, such a look is worth more than</p>
    <p> than 100 Guineas, at last he awoke, rais'd <br /> himself and said to Brother<a href=".html">Johannes</a><br /> now Bless me, &amp; then he took his hand &amp; <br /> laid it himself upon his
      forehead, &amp; <br /> so <a href=".html">Johannes</a>Blessed him with that <br /> Verse: &amp; let his Mouth expiring on <br /> thy dear Breast recline &amp;c. to <br /> which our dear

      &amp; then he shut his eyes <br /> again and slept &amp; so accord- <br /> ing to his wish his Spirit was <br />kiss'd away in Sleep &amp; the Brn <br /> &amp; Sisters round him <sup>sung
