      <h2>Elizabeth Coffin</h2>
      <p>Our late <a href="#mlper000234.html">S<sup>r</sup> Eliz<sup>th</sup> Coffin</a> was born
         <br/><sup>near</sup>at<a href="#mlpla000124.html">Ellesmere, on the borders of Wales</a>, <sup>A.D. 1777</sup><br/> her father being an extensive farmer. <br/>
         					Of her earlier years, very little is <br/>
         					known to us; as our late S<sup>r</sup> left <br/>
         					no memoranda of her course thro' <br/>
         					time. It appears however that <br/>
         					her religious impressions were <br/>
         					received early in life; &amp; she was accustomed <br/>
         					to refer to one youthful experience <br/>
         					as a turning point in her experience<sup>course</sup>. 
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					Whilst attending the parish Church, <br/>some particular sentence in the morning
         <br/>
         prayer come home to her heart with
         <br/>
         such power, that she felt the love of  <br/><a href=".html">Christ</a> as accomplishing her redemption.  <br/>
         					She was <sup>thus</sup> persuaded of her interest in <br/>
         					his atonement, &amp; it is remarkable <br/>
         					in the religious experience of our <br/>
         					late S<sup>r</sup>, that her course was not so <br/>
         					subject to change &amp; deviation as 
         			</p>
   	
   	
   	
   	
      <p>
         				
         					that of the majority of the Lord's <br/>
         					children. As far as her X<sup>n</sup> experience <br/>
         					is known to us, she has alway spoken <br/>
         					of his life of faith as a happy one; <br/>
         					she knew no periods of gloom &amp; tasted <br/>
         					not the bitterness of the soul from  <br/>
         					whom the Lord's comforts are with <br/>
         					drawn.
         			</p>
      <p><em>As the age of 17 or 18</em>, she removed <br/>
         					to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, and entered the family <br/>
         					of our late <a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup> Vowel</a>with whom she <br/>
         					lived till that lady's death. It <br/>
         					was during her residence there, &amp; <br/>
         					during <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Montgomry</a>'s service of <br/>
         					the Congn that she joined the Church
         <br/>
         of the B<sup>rn</sup>, of which she has been <br/>
         					so many years a consistent member
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					After <a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup> Vowel</a>'s departure, she  <br/>
         					remained with the 2 <a href=".html">M<sup>r</sup> Youngs</a>, the <br/>
         					nephews <sup>of the deceased</sup> till her own health began to fail.
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					About the <em>year 1820</em>, she removed <br/>
         					to <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23154.html">Bristol</a>, where she became an in <br/>
         					mate, of the sisters house, during 
         			</p>
      <p><a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Okelys</a>' ministry. Her stay <br/>
         					in <a href="#mlpla000030.html">Bristol</a> was but short, &amp; <br/>
         					the subsequent years of her life,  <br/>
         					up to her last removal in <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, <br/>
         					appear to have been somewhat un- <br/>
         					settled as to her abode. She lived <br/>
         					in <a href="#mlpla000271.html">Fulneck S<sup>rs</sup> House</a> for a few <br/>
         					years; &amp; also spent some time again <br/>
         					in London, &amp; with more than one <br/>
         					family of her relatives. 
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					In <em>July 1831</em><sup>i.e about</sup> 24 years ago <br/>
         					she settled finally on <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, a <br/>
         					place which seems above others to <br/>
         					be that of her choice. Her <br/>
         					walk among us here, her peculiarities <br/>
         
         					her cheerful nature, her activity &amp; <br/>
         					especially her great love for the meetings <br/>
         					for family &amp; public worship these <br/>
         
         					are well known to many who this <br/>
         					day see her mortal remains conveyed <br/>
         					to their last resting place.  <br/></p>
      <p>
         				
         					Being so long an invalid, her thoughts <br/>
         					were often busied <sup>concerning</sup>upon her own
         			</p>
   	
   	
   	
   	
      <p>
         				
         					health whilst she inquired sympa-
         <br/>
         thisingly after the welfare of others.
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					About a year ago, when speaking <br/>
         					of a recent attack of illness, she re- <br/>
         					marked I had sometimes the feeling <br/>
         					that she Lord would take me to <br/>
         					himself. Being asked whether she <br/>
         					felt herself prepared for the last change <br/>
         					she replied in her quick characteristic <br/>
         					manner &amp; quite cheerfully -- It would <br/>
         					be a great shame if I were not ready <br/>
         					for it; for it is now 50 years since <br/>
         					I first knew the Lord; &amp; since that <br/>
         					time he has enabled me to serve <br/>
         					Him It would be ungrateful in me <br/>
         					to think he would not accept me <br/>
         					at the last." 
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					For the last twelve month <del>s</del> her <br/>health was perceived to her failing con-
         <br/>
         siderably tho' she would not, till <br/>
         					near the last, hear of seeking medi- <br/>
         					cal advice. Tho' she most often <br/>
         					have been suffering from weakness <br/>
         					&amp; pain she was still seen as her -
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					place in the Prayer Hall &amp; Chapel <br/>
         					where the meetings were always a <br/>
         					source of spiritual enjoyment<sup>To her</sup> "As <br/>
         					long as I can I must go" she would <br/>
         					say "for soon I may not be able"-
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					Towards the close of last week, <br/>
         					as perceptible change was noticed in  <br/>
         					her &amp; it be came evident to her friends, <br/>
         					tho' not as first to herself, that her <br/>
         					time here below was drawing near <br/>
         					it close. When her labouress <br/>
         					alluded to the approaching end, &amp; asked <br/>
         					her whether she felt ready for our Saviours<br/>
         					coming, if it should please Him to  <br/>
         					take her now, she answered, that <br/>
         					she would like to feel Him nearer, but <br/>
         					she had no fear.
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					On Sunday, the last day of her <br/>
         					life, tho' growing very feeble, she <br/>
         					retained a clear conciousness &amp; on <br/>
         					unshaken faith. In reply to a question <br/>
         					as to her spiritual support in this trouble<br/>
         					she answered with energy "I will trust<br/>
         					Him tho' he slay me." And again <br/>
         					she said "I care not what pain</p>
   	
   	
   	
   	
      <p>				
         					I have, if I have only Him with me 
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					For the attention of the Sisters &amp; <br/>
         					friends to her in her illness, she was <br/>
         					truly grateful, &amp; expressed herself <br/>surprised at the display of love<br/>
         					which she witnessed. 
         			</p>
      <p>
         					On Sunday evening when her <br/>Laboress told her <del>she</del> our Savr<del>might</del><sup>would probably</sup><br/>
         					very soon come &amp; take her to himself, <br/>
         					she seemed still somewhat surprised that <br/>
         					her end should be so near; but was <br/>
         					free from all apprehension of the event. <br/>
         					Her feeling appeared to be that of the <br/>
         					conviction &amp; confidence expressed <br/>
         					in the Hymn 1184. 2 Thou knowst &amp;c.

         					*Insert <br/>
         					She regretted B<sup>r</sup> Libbay's absence from <br/>
         					the Congn at this time, much wishing to  <br/>
         					live to see him again; as at the first, <br/>
         					she appeared not right to have under- <br/>
         					stood him in his Conversat with her.
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					When asked if she wished to par <br/>
         					take of the H. Com<sup>n</sup> again, she replied <br/>
         					somewhat doubtfull, -- I do not rest on <br/>that - You know He is my Bread of <br/>
         					Life. 
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					The same evening she received the  <br/>blessing of the Congn. imparted by <a href="#mlper000703.html">B<sup>r</sup><br/>
            Okely</a> after a fervent prayer for the  <br/>
         					nearness &amp; support of <a href=".html">Jesus</a> in this <br/>
         					hour of trial - She was not only per- <br/>
         					fectly conscious during this transaction <br/>
         					but expressed also the enjoyment &amp; <br/>benefit she had derived from it.
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					About 10 o'cl. the same evening <br/><sup>Jan 28th /55</sup> whilst supported in the arms of some 
         			</p>
      <p>
         				
         					the sisters the hour of her departure
         <br/>
         came; the silver cord was loosed, <br/>
         					&amp; she gently breathed her last, her <br/>
         					ransomed? spirit departing to be with <br/>
         					that Lord whom she had long here <br/>
         					followed in faith tho' in feebleness &amp; <br/><sup>with the sense of</sup> much unperfection. <sup>Her age was 77 years.</sup> May our <br/>
         					end be as tranquil &amp; happy, &amp; as <br/>
         					full of confidence in our unseen <br/>
         					but present &amp; faithfulRedeemer!</p></body>
