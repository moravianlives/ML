Memoir of the Single Sr Eleanor Briggs
I was born at Pudsey in the Parish of Calverly, County of York, Octr 20th 1752, and
Baptized by a Presbyterian Minister, my Parents being of that persuasion, but soon after
join'd the Methodists, who having at that time no Chapel in Pudsey they held their meetings in
my Fathers house. the Minister who came at different times to preach, often prayed the Lord
to bless us Children, the names of Mr Whitfield, Westley, Grimshaw, Eastwood, and many others
I remember particularly, and have often in the sequel thought their blessing has rested upon
us. When I was five years old it pleas'd the Lord to take my Father to himself, after a tedious
illness of two years, which brought my Mother into very distressing in circumstances, a few
days before his departure, he desir'd that Mother with five Children might be call'd to his
Bedside, that he might commend us in prayer to the Lord, and give us his last blessing,
he assur'd my Mother the Lord wou'd care for her and us too, if she wou'd only put her trust
in him it was a moving sight five helpless Children, with a Mother almost drown'd in tears
and ready to faint with trouble, happily for her she knew in whom she believed and trusted
in him with her whole heart, and amidst all her trouble who had faith that the Lord would
never leave, nor forsake her, and she was not put to shame. In my sixth year I happened
to be where one of the Methodists was preaching which terrified me so much that for some
days after I could do nothing but cry, his discourse was upon the state of the wicked after
death, I thought I was one of those wicked people, and must go to hell, I told my Mother
my distress, she bid me pray to God to have mercy upon me, I did this, as well as I could
but thought I was so bad he would not grant my prayer, I beg'd her to pray for me that
I might not be lost, she assur'd me she did, and she was sure I shou'd be saved if I was a
good Child, however this did not satisfy me, an Uncle of mine who lived near Fulneck came
often to our house, he was one of the Brethren, I thought the next time I saw him I would
tell him my distress, I was anxious to see him and know what he would say to me
that I went into a Wood he had to pass thro to meet him, he took me up in his arms
telling me that God Almighty whom I was so much afraid of came into the world too
as a little Child, and lived a life of suffering upwards of thirty years on purpose
to save sinners from being lost, this made a deep impression upon me, which I never lost
tho' I have since run astray in various ways, yet my gracious Savior kept his
hand over me. A Gentleman in the town who took delight in visiting the poor and
doing good came often to see my mother, and was a great comfort to her, she put me to
school, and said when I was big enough she would take me into her own family, but
it pleas'd the Lord to order it otherwise, my Mother being unable to provide for five
Children was oblig'd to apply to the overseer for relief, he propos'd placing the two
oldest Girls out aprentice, this caus'd her great trouble, knowing that many were
placed in families, where neither their souls nor bodies were cared for, she pray'd
fervently to the Lord himself to make a way for us, and in answer to her prayer a
friend of hers came in as overseer, to him she told her trouble, he gave her the choice
of three places, the one she fix'd on for me was the Revd Mr Charlesworth of
Fulneck, I being the younger, he was surpriz'd that she chose that for me, and altho
reason, at that time she knew nothing of the Brethren, and cou'd only give 
reason that it was impress'd on her mind, it was the place for me, the [original damaged]
provided my way and brought me to his chosen people, where thro' his grace [original damaged]
remain'd, his all powerful hand has in mercy been held over me, and [original damaged]
to keep my ground even to this day, when I am completing my sixtieth [original damaged]
committed to the care of the Revd Mr Charlesworth, and bound a [original damaged]
Mother entreated him not to let me be turn'd off the place when my time was [original damaged]
her with Fatherly kindness, and assur'd her I should not if I conduct [original damaged]
ought, the time was now come when my Mother & I must part, after [original damaged]
on both sides, she pray'd the Lord to bless me, and bed me farewell [original damaged]
among entire strangers, my much respected Master & Mistress [original damaged]
Fatherless Child only eight years old, with the utmost tender 
will be rewarded by Him who takes notice of the smallest kind
Children, especially to the friendless, I was put to a school kept
I had an opportunity of learning many verses concerning our Savi
deep impression upon me, our school Mrs was not able to teach us


of work but she never failed to tell as much of our Savior, she one day took us into the
Srs sleeproom, as soon at the door open'd, the thought struck me, O that I might one day
live in this house, and while my companions were looking about them, I crept unobserv'd
between the Beds and prostrated myself in prayer to my Savior to grant me this favor
and simple as it was the Lord did not disdain to hear me, for soon after any dear
Master was appointed to the office of Minister & Warden of the Congn and having
only room for themselves, and another for their servant they cou'd not take me,
now come on the trial what was to become of me? at that time no Children
were permitted to live on the place whose Parents did not belong, therefore my stay
was much opposed, but my good Master feeling bound by his promise to my Mother
beg'd it might be submitted to a director from the Lord, leave was granted not only
to remain in Fulneck but also to live in the Srs House; previous to this Br Charlesworth
had obtain'd the promise of the Choir helper of the Single Srs, Sr Mary Voagleson
to take me in promising on his part that I should not be troublesome to the family
with regard to my living, she took me into her special care, and treated me with
the tenderness of Mother, her memory while be ever dear to me a helpless orphan
I trust the Lord has rewarded her in this world, and that she is now receiving the
crowning reward in heaven, it was a severe trial to me when this dear person
was call'd to Gracehill as Choir helper of the Sr there, but the Lord in whom I trusted did
not forsake me. I was recd into the Conngn in the year 1767. which proved a great
blessing to me, and I went on for some time happy and chearful, but subsequently fell
into a careless indifferent state, yet strong convictions that I was wrong follow'd me,
good advice was not wanting, but foolishly disregarded, till it pleas'd the Lord to visit me
with a fit of sickness which brought me so low that I was on the brink of the grave, when
I was inform'd that the Doctor had given me up, I said I shou'd soon be gone, it gave
me a shock no words can describe, the fear & hate must be lost for ever drove me in
earnest prayer to the Lord to raise me from that bed of sickness, and not to permit
me to be launched into eternity unprepared, it pleas'd him in mercy to grant my request
and I made many promises to him to begin again anew, but alas they were soon
forgot when I got well, and I went on as before, till the Lord in mercy to his
rebellious creature visited me with another severe attack of sickness, it struck me with
such a deep sense of my sinful state, that I fell on my face at his feet imploring his
patience and forgiveness, and from that time I determind to follow the Lord thro'
all whether hard or easy might be my lot thro' life. In Octr 1776 I had the favor
to be spectator at the Holy Comn and July the 19th 1777 to partake of that high
est good I shall never forget that enjoyment, I had many difficulties to encounter
in outward circumstances, apparently often impossible to be overcome but the
help of my Savr brought me thru, and about this time I was appointed to teach
in the Children's school in Pudsey plan, for some time it was in a very prosperous
state, during the summer as many as Sixty in number and some pleasing proofs
of our Saviors blessing became manifested at the departure of many of these dear
young Children, from here I was call'd into the Srs house to have the care
[original damaged] the wash, this situation I found one of peculiar difficulties, but here also
[original damaged] oved the Lords help was sufficient to support me, now I will look
[original damaged] on the way the Lord hath led me to humble and prove me, and know
[original damaged] was in my heart, to see how kindly he has led me on thro' at times it seem'd
[original damaged] I had many hard struggles before I could bring myself to lie as
[original damaged] the feet of my Savior, but one day when in the deepest distress I took the
[original damaged] book and open'd the words for myself, the Lord thy God turned the cause into
[original damaged] because the Lord thy God loved thee, it came with such power to
[original damaged] as if spoken to me, and impossible it seem'd I have liv'd to see its
[original damaged] which constrains me to say is anything too hard for the Lord! After this
[original damaged] was pleas'd to make a way for place of rest to me, by enabling me to procure
[original damaged] a little dwelling of my own, the happy days I spent there can never be
[original damaged] how often have I come from the Chapel and prostrated myself before my Savior
[original damaged] ever ends, his gracious visitations there constrain me to say with favor'd ???
[original damaged] that is present here. Fulneck, O Fulneck much belov'd Fulneck which gave
[original damaged] prov'd, how often hast thou witness'd my prayers and then offerd up forgiveness
[original damaged] distress, every spot in thee is hallowed ground thro'


hundreds who have been train'd up in thee, and brought to the knowledge of a Savior
in that dear place, O that the Lord may in future cause his face to shine upon it, to the
end of days, that thousands yet unborn may be converted, and become witnesses of his
salvation together with hundreds in my time who in that blessd place found grace
and who will join me in an endless eternity to sing his praises for bringing us
thither, I desire especially dear Savior to give the unfeigned thanks for raising
me up a friend who for fifty years has remained such, thro' all painful and trying
circumstances, and now when I am old, and unable to help myself is willing to
assist and care for me, I thank thee for giving her grace and patience to bear with my
infirmities with unexampled tenderness, merciful Lord be pleas'd to reward her for all
her kind services, thou hast promised that a cup of cold water given in thy name
to any of thy Children shall receive its reward, and I feel assured thou hast seen her
kindness to me, and will bless her abundantly, most merciful Lord be pleas'd to accept
of my grateful tears, for all they gracious answers to my prayers all my Life
day again thou hast fulfill'd thy promise that thou wilt help thy poor unworthy crea
ture who calls upon thee in the day of trouble and I will thou shall
glorify me, this 24th of Augst is one of those never to be forgotten; I did indeed sit under his
shadow, and his fruit was sweet to my taste, his manner over me was love, all around me
was mercy the remembrance will remain dear as long as I remain in this poor
tabernacle of clay, and when permitted to join the saints above my praises shall be
tuned to higher strains of gratitude to my dear redeemer for his condescention to his
poor worm for such unbounded favors, Jesus will I never leave, while I breathe and
have my senses, from his merits I receive pardon for my past offences, all the power
of my mind, to my Savior are resign'd. and now my dr Savr since it hath pleas'd thee
to take to thy self my best earthly friend, I humbly entreat thee to heal the wound, nothing
short of thyself can heal a broken heart, come thou and dwell within me, I desire to adore
thee for thee gift in her continued to me for sixty years, she was thine, not mine, and tho'
separated by circumstances for 15 years, thou broughtest us together again, and wert our
refuge in all trials, we lived in love and harmony, our only object being to preserve a close
communion with thee, after 22 years thus spent thou hast received her to thyself, I thank
thee for her happy lot, I know she is receiving her reward for faithfulness to others commit
ed to her care besides me,  and now I desire to thank thee for preparing a home for
me here in Fairfield when I was destitute, and raising up friends who provide for
wants, wait upon me, and treat me with kindness beyond what I deserve, also for
many other friends who contribute to my comfort, one Lady in particular, may thy
blessing rest upon her & her sister, and a number of other friends, thou knowest them all
where bounty, and sympathy for my afflicted state have wiped away many bitter tears
dr Savr once more I humbly entreat thee to lay thy blessing on all those who feel for and succor
the afflicted, and if the smallest things are noticed and rewarded by thee the greater vouch [original damaged] 
to me cannot be overlookd, this is my comfort under a weight of obligations which now [original damaged] 
but thy blessing can repay. Prayer has been my support thro' life, and thro' [original damaged] 
now the staff of my old age, O may that precious gift be preserved to [original damaged] 
days. O prayer thou move of things unknown. Who can be poor [original damaged] 
Thou wert the fount of things unknown. And more than worlds of go [original damaged] 
bereft of all beside. That bears the name or form of bliss. ?? [original damaged] 
betide. My God in mercy leave me this.
