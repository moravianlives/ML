					<l>Woodhouse</l>
					<l>I was born Sep<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1713 in the City of York and baptiz&apos;d in the Ch</l>
					<l>of England, was also carefully educated by my Parents, suitable for a</l>
					<l>Trademans Child, they were particularly attentive that I shoud not be se-</l>
					<l>duc&apos;d by the world. From my youngest Years I had a  secret desire to</l>
					<l>please God, and to avoid every thing that was bad, this made me very atten</l>
					<l>tive to the course of religious people, but my Fathers circumstances</l>
					<l>being upon the decline, I was (in order to avoid poverty) necessitated to go to</l>
					<l>Service, Thus I undertook a House-keepers place in a reputable family</l>
					<l>in the Country, where my Mistress faithfully instructed me in every</l>
					<l>thing she saw me deficient in, and among the rest, endeavour&apos;d also to</l>
					<l>teach me true holiness, but my heart constantly convicted me that I was</l>
					<l>not right. Being now better qualify&apos;d for a larger undertaking, I left</l>
					<l>this place in hopes of bettering my circumstances, and resolv&apos;d for London,</l>
					<l>where I had two B<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in reputable business, I went thither by Sea</l>
					<l>with some acquaintances, but we had not been out a day before a violent</l>
					<l>storm arose, to that &apos;twas expected we shou&apos;d suffer Shipwreck, but that</l>
					<l>we might have our lives, it was resolv&apos;d to take to the long boat, but</l>
					<l>I was determin&apos;d rather to perish with the Ship, than venture in the</l>
					<l>boat, and leave my cloaths behind me, and thus suffer&apos;d myself to be</l>
					<l>lock&apos;d down in the Cabbin, laid myself on a Bed, never to behold this</l>
					<l>world any more, recomending my Soul to God, and for sometime put</l>
					<l>my hands over the bed side to feel if the water was approaching, then</l>
					<l>drop&apos;d asleep. The Ship weather&apos;d the storm, and the Captain return&apos;d but</l>
					<l>how greatly was I supriz&apos;d when with dificulty I was awoke, and found</l>
					<l>myself still in the Body, and all the vissisitudes of Life yet to go through.</l>

					<l>which I thought wou&apos;d be buried forever when I laid me down. When I</l>
					<l>came to London, my B<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> took good care of me, but I durst not undertake</l>
					<l>a House keepers place in this City, till I had first inform&apos;d myself of</l>
					<l>what belong&apos;d to such an undertaking, therefore took a House maids</l>
					<l>place in an eminent Physicians family, but this proved too hard for me</l>
					<l>and in about a months time, was unable to stand on my Legs, the</l>
					<l>Doctor hearing of this order&apos;d me into his room, and on examining into</l>
					<l>my constitution, came <hi rend="strikethrough">upon</hi> <add place="above">to speak about</add> my family and education, and on my telling <add place="above">him</add></l>
					<l>who I was, my good <hi rend="strikethrough">Lady</hi> <add place="above">mistress</add> answer&apos;d him in French, that my Mother was</l>
					<l>her near Relation, I was imediately order&apos;d into better care and <add place="above">an</add> easier</l>
					<l>Situation, which together with some Medicines soon restor&apos;d me to <add place="above">the use of</add> my</l>
					<l>Limbs, I then undertook <add place="above">the</add> House Keepers place in the same family, but</l>
					<l>cou&apos;d not continue long therein, the other Servants plagueing me incessantly</l>
					<l><add place="above">because</add> <hi rend="strikethrough">as</hi> I cou&apos;d not join in their extravagant schemes and unfaithfulness to</l>
					<l>the prejudice of my good Master and Misstress, therefore without any</l>
					<l>explanation desir&apos;d to be set at Liberty; this was a real disappointment</l>
					<l>to them, for they thought they had a faithfull person in their <hi rend="strikethrough">circumstan</hi> <add place="above">Family</add></l>
					<l><hi rend="strikethrough">ces</hi> <add place="above">who also took</add> care of their Child<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. A pious Lady who liv&apos;d there, and had</l>
					<l>renounc&apos;d the errours of the Church of Rome, <hi rend="strikethrough">had also entertain&apos;d hopes</hi> <add place="above">wished me</add></l>
					<l><hi rend="strikethrough">of preserving me</hi> <add place="above">to remain</add> in <add place="above">the</add> <hi rend="strikethrough">a</hi> single state <add place="above">and</add> to live to the Lord Jesus, and would</l>
					<l>have condition&apos;d with me on any terms I pleas&apos;d, if I wou&apos;d remain</l>
					<l>with her or this family, but nothing cou&apos;d prevail upon me to live among</l>
					<l>such a set of Servants as was there; I soon enter&apos;d into a large <add place="above">grand</add> <hi rend="strikethrough">magnifi</hi></l>
					<l><hi rend="strikethrough">cent</hi> family in Bloomsbury Square, here I only staid 11 months, I then</l>
					<l>got a House keepers place in a worthy family in Berkshire; in about 3</l>
					<l>Years the Lady of the Family died, and the whole care fell upon me, to</l>
					<l>the great oppression of my mind, for the continual want of the knowledge</l>

					<l>of my God imbitter&apos;d every thing to me, and tho&apos; we had family devotion</l>
					<l>morning and evening by the Chaplain, all was nothing to me, because the</l>
					<l>practice answer&apos;d not to the precepts, and I became very miserable; on asking</l>
					<l>advice of the Chaplain, he told me to read Dean Swift, and such like lively</l>
					<l>Authors, and visit more in the Country, but I resolv&apos;d for London to get</l>
					<l>better advice, left my good place to the great distress of my worthy Master.</l>
					<l>In London I took to the Methodists contrary to the advice of my friends, who</l>
					<l>said I shoud lose my Character thereby, <hi rend="strikethrough">and</hi> <add place="above">as</add> they were nothing but a</l>
					<l>loose <add place="above">rabble</add> <hi rend="strikethrough">rabbling People</hi>. I learnt several branches of business, in order to go no</l>
					<l>more to service, but to maintain myself in a single state, but this was of no long</l>
					<l>duration, being much importun&apos;d to go to my late place in Berkshire, I ven-</l>
					<l>turd there again, and continu&apos;d several Years, and met with a company of</l>
					<l>Single Gentlewomen at Windsor, who like me, were seaking after the King-</l>
					<l>dom of God, but cou&apos;d meet with no other consolation than the practice of good</l>
					<l>morals, and leaving ourselves to the mercy of God. In the Year 1750 my</l>
					<l>Mother was taken very sick, and desired much to see me before her depar-</l>
					<l>ture, I got leave of my Master to make this visit to York, promising</l>
					<l>that I wou&apos;d return again, but in 10 days after my arrival there, my</l>
					<l>dear Mother departed this Life, and my younger B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> being in good busi</l>
					<l>ness, wou&apos;d not let me leave York any more, but try&apos;d to settle me in the</l>
					<l>Confectioners business, and procur&apos;d me an original Shop of this kind,</l>
					<l>which thro&apos; his interest prov&apos;d amazing<add place="above">ly</add> successfull, yet on every relaxation</l>
					<l>from business, I was oppress&apos;d with an uneasy mind about being sav&apos;d</l>
					<l>and attaining to the Kingdom of that God whom I thought I lov&apos;d, I re</l>
					<l>solv&apos;d to go to the Methodists meetings, especially in the evenings, when no</l>
					<l>body that knew me cou&apos;d see me, but was soon discover&apos;d by a Lady, who</l>

					<l>had visited much in the family I liv&apos;d with in Berkshire she made</l>
					<l>herself known to me, and never let me rest unless I went continually</l>
					<l>to the means of grace, as she call&apos;d the meeting, but I cou&apos;d not bear</l>
					<l>their manner of singing and praying so openly, and she liked, I</l>
					<l>also thought they wou&apos;d ruin my outward circumstances, as my</l>
					<l>House was never free from Methodists and yet I found no rest for</l>
					<l>my Soul, but <hi rend="strikethrough">got a bitterness</hi> <add place="above">felt an Enmity</add> to God for calling me to an account for</l>
					<l>my sinfull nature, which I neither made, nor wanted to live unto</l>
					<l>soon after this 2 persons came into my Shop, my Servant whisperd</l>
					<l>in my ear that they were Moravians M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brook by name</l>
					<l>I soon found freedom with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brook to tell her my situation of heart.</l>
					<l>She desir&apos;d me to be comforted, for the Lord Jesus wou&apos;d never have convinc&apos;d</l>
					<l>me of <add place="above">my</add> sinfulness, but He wou&apos;d also convince me where a true righ</l>
					<l>teousness abounded, he had paid the ransom for all my sins thro&apos; his</l>
					<l>Death and sufferings, and wou&apos;d forgive me all if I cou&apos;d but believe</l>
					<l>he suffer&apos;d for my sake, and He woud make me happy thro&apos; his merits</l>
					<l>without any works of mine, or any thing that any creature cou&apos;d help</l>
					<l>me to, those were such words as I never heard before, that all my</l>
					<l>happiness consisted in believing in the Lord Jesus, all was to me as if</l>
					<l>an angel from Heaven had been conversing with me, I never know before</l>
					<l>that my Redeemer was the Lord Jesus Christ, she moreover told me</l>
					<l>that his grace wou&apos;d regenerate my sinfull nature, both Soul &amp; Body</l>
					<l>from this time I got other Ideas of my Salvation then I ever had before</l>
					<l>and no more thought of being sav&apos;d by my good deeds, yet great distress</l>
					<l>follow&apos;d me daily. I went one afternoon to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brook, who desir&apos;d me to</l>
					<l><unclear>stay</unclear> tea, other company also came in, and among the rest a B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. from</l>

					<l>Pudsey, whom I knew nothing of. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brook and the said B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> began</l>
					<l>such spiritual conversation as I never heard in all my life, and thought</l>
					<l>I had neither part nor let in such happiness as was to be enjoy&apos;d by</l>
					<l>believing in the Lord Jesus, and I knew not where to hide my face</l>
					<l>for shame and perplexity, when the B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> spoke of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> forgiveing</l>
					<l>him his sins when the most wretched of men, I burst out with involuntary</l>
					<l><hi rend="strikethrough">crys</hi> Crys for the same Saviour to bless me, and in a moment, I was</l>
					<l>(as it were) seperated from all bodily sight of the Company, and saw</l>
					<l>nothing but my dear Saviour who stood ready to forgive me all my sins,</l>
					<l>shame and abasement seiz&apos;d me so that I knew nothing what I said</l>
					<l>or did, my former unbelief and denial of all possibility of having my</l>
					<l>sins forgiven while in this Life brought me down into the dust, and</l>
					<l>I was inconsolable, and knew not how to accept such great grace, after</l>
					<l>such bold asertions of unbelief as I had made, my senses became more</l>
					<l>and more open&apos;d to the great blessing our dear Saviour had bestowed</l>
					<l>upon me, but my friends durst not leave me above till I came more to</l>
					<l>myself, and I was so enfeebled <hi rend="strikethrough">thro&apos;</hi> <add place="below">in</add> Body and mind, that for sometime</l>
					<l>I cou&apos;d hardly stand upon my Legs, and when I was conducted home,</l>
					<l>some friends met me there, who, seeing my tears, and hearing my spiritual</l>
					<l>conversation, thought the Lord had appear&apos;d to me as He did to Paul</l>
					<l>and told me that I was now a right Paulist, but my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> comprehended</l>
					<l>it as what our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> said to Nicodamus that to he truely born again was</l>
					<l>a baptizm of the Spirit, I told them, I cou&apos;d say with Job, I have heard of Him,</l>
					<l>but now my eyes have seen him, the spirit of prayer was also powerfully</l>
					<l>with me, I fell on my knees, and all the company with me, but what I said</l>
					<l>I do not remember, but was full of astonishment at the great change I had</l>

					<l>met with, and shed many tears on account of my former unbelief, this</l>
					<l>impression abode with me more than a week, which I spent in wonder</l>
					<l>at having such a great grace bestow&apos;d on me, thro&apos; the merits of our</l>
					<l>Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> shedding his blood for the poor human sinfull race of men, and</l>
					<l>I asuredly restor&apos;d to the fellowship of my God, to whom I had eternally</l>
					<l>belonged, yea, for several weaks if a child had but named the Name</l>
					<l>of Jesus, my heart wou&apos;d cry mine, mine forever, and I was render&apos;d</l>
					<l>incapable of any other conversation, then about his infinite love to poor</l>
					<l>sinners, I beg&apos;d every one who wanted to see me, that they wou&apos;d but</l>
					<l>love the Lord Jesus, then all their sins wou&apos;d be forgiven, and the very</l>
					<l>hankering to sin wou&apos;d thro&apos; that love be mortify&apos;d, and its pow&apos;r to</l>
					<l><hi rend="strikethrough">please</hi> <add place="above">distress</add> me be taken away, and they <add place="above">would be</add> enabled to do the works of righteous</l>
					<l>ness, and not before, this was a great offence to the Methodists and</l>
					<l>many whose heart this suited went no more amongst them, but fre</l>
					<l>quented M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Inghams meetings, being now asur&apos;d in my heart that</l>
					<l>the Lord Jesus had reveal&apos;d <add place="above">himself thro&apos;</add> his Holy Spirit within me, and as</l>
					<l>the Holy Sacrament was to be the following Sunday at my</l>
					<l>Parish Church, I consulted with my good friend M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Galantine,</l>
					<l>if I shou&apos;d now go to the Holy Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, which she had no objection to,</l>
					<l>as I cou&apos;d now make a true and sinnerlike confession <hi rend="strikethrough">before the</hi></l>
					<l>before the Lord, but when I came to the Altar, the awefulness</l>
					<l>of the transaction, to think that the Body and Blood of God my</l>
					<l>Saviour wou&apos;d now mix with a poor sinfull human creature so</l>
					<l>abas&apos;d me, that I shed numberless tears, I was moreover seiz&apos;d</l>

					<l>hear the rattling of my bones; during the Ministers prayer</l>
					<l>I recover&apos;d, and crept softly to my pew, but cou&apos;d not hide how</l>

					<l>had now departed from me, after so many days enjoyment, I look</l>
					<l>on my whole Salvation as inrecoverable, and that my sins and</l>
					<l>transgressions were of a more condemning kind than ever before</l>

					<l>in short, we cou&apos;d say much of her faithfull service in our House</l>
