					<l>the 25 Day of Feb: 1727 where she Liv&apos;d till</l>
					<l>about 1743, when she being stirr&apos;d up in </l>
					<l>her Heart by the Holy ghost to seek after</l>
					<l>the Salvation of her soul and sometime af</l>
					<l>ter hearing the Testimony of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>; &amp; being</l>
					<l>convinced of the truth &amp; simplicity of the</l>
					<l>gospel Taught by them, Drow accquaintance</l>
					<l>with them and in the year 1748 gain&apos;d the</l>
					<l>favour to Live in the Single Sisters House in</l>
					<l>Duckenfield where she behav&apos;d very well</l>
					<l>&amp; was Loved by all. </l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>Having afterwards along with some more</l>
					<l>sisters paid a visit To the Congregation in</l>
					<l>Yorkshire she express&apos;d her Mind &amp; hearty</l>
					<l>Desire to be a member of that Body.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>Hearing of the Single Sisters <add place="above">House</add> <hi rend="underline">Here</hi> being</l>
					<l>built she would say O! that our Saviour may</l>
					<l>once grant me the favour to live in that <hi rend="underline">house</hi></l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>In the month of September 1750 she with</l>
					<l>the rest of the Oconomy Removing from Duck</l>
					<l>enfield to Live in Yorkshire Took her abode in </l>
					<l>Tyre-sell-Hall where she Lived to the Satis</l>

					<l>as she was not Receiv&apos;d in the Congregation</l>
					<l>would sometimes give her Pain</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>In the Latter End of the Year 1751 she</l>
					<l>begun to be a little Disorder&apos;d by the</l>

					<l>also being attended with a Dropsical dis</l>
					<l>ease &amp; a Complication of disorders Ren</l>
					<l>der&apos;d her almost incapable of Business.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>Her Reception lay very near her Heart &amp;</l>
					<l>she Often would sigh &amp; weep after a nearer</l>
					<l>fellowship with our dear Saviour &amp; his Church</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>Thus she continued all Summer &amp; as to</l>
					<l>health Better &amp; Worse</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>In th&apos; month of Novr: 1732 she Obtain&apos;d</l>
					<l>the Grace to be a Receiv&apos;d <add place="above">into the Congn</add> to her Great Joy</l>
					<l>&amp; satisfaction.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>When we Enter&apos;d in our Choir House</l>
					<l>she Chearfully Came with <add place="above">us</add> Praising &amp; adoring</l>
					<l>the Lamb who had granted her <hi rend="underline">that</hi>, she so</l>
					<l>long had wish&apos;d for: But she had not Long</l>
					<l>Enjoy&apos;d this happiness before her Joy was</l>
					<l>in some Respect Interrupted by the re</l>
					<l>turn of her Disorder in a much greater</l>
					<l>Degree than before &amp; in the beginning</l>
					<l>of the Present year the Dropsey siezing</l>
					<l>her whole Tabrnacle &amp; her Arm being</l>
					<l>quite useless by the Rhoumatism &amp;c</l>
					<l>she was not able to help herself there</l>
					<l>fore was Oblig&apos;d to take her Room &amp;</l>
					<l>now it was she begun to think of going home</l>
					<l>&amp; speaking to a Sister about it Said you</l>
					<l>will See One of the Poorest &amp; perhaps</l>
					<l>Least thought of geting the Favour to go</l>
					<l>out of this <add place="above">House</add> First, &amp; wish&apos;d that the happy</l>
					<l>hour might soon Come. </l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>She spoke of her Departure with a great</l>
					<l>deal of Pleasure Rejoiceing in the full</l>
					<l>assurance she felt of the Love of our</l>
					<l>Saviour &amp; the Free forgiveness, of all her</l>

					<l>wish&apos;d for Habitation &amp; to her beloved Lamb</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>They asking if she had a mind to be Buried</l>
					<l>in her own Country she answer&apos;d No! I have</l>
					<l>hither to Chosen to Live with the Congregation</l>
					<l>I chuse also to Die with them &amp; it is</l>
					<l>my Choice to be Buried Here</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>After they was gone she Looking out</l>
					<l>at her window &amp; seeing the Burying Ground</l>
					<l>she Express&apos;d her Hearty desire of going</l>
					<l>home; But added that she should <hi rend="strikethrough">should</hi></l>
					<l>be Extreamly glad to Partake of the</l>
					<l>Lords Supper first, for now she felt her</l>
					<l>Heart very desirous theref, &amp; of a nearer</l>
					<l>fellowshipe with him whose Wound, was</l>
					<l>very near &amp; dear to her Heart</l></lg></p>

					<l>that Verse I wish I was with him then I </l>
					<l>should also be with my Lamb then I would</l>
					<l>think on many whom I Leave behind me but</l>
