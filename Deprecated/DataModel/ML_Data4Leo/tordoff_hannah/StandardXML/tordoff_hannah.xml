					<l>The Single Sisr Han<hi rend="superscript">h</hi> Tordoff has left the following</l>
					<l>concerning her course of Life.</l></lg>
			</p>
					<p>
					<lg>
					<l>I was born at Houme in</l>
					<l>the Lordship of Tong Dec<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1759 baptiz&apos;d by</l>
					<l>the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> in my Childhood I frequented the Childrens</l>
					<l>meetings which prov&apos;d a great blessing to my heart &amp;</l>
					<l>I often prayd our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to make me quite happy,</l>
					<l>the Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Oeconomy was then in Houme Lane where I injoyd</l>
					<l>the Love of the Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> and had also our classes there,</l>
					<l>which were blest to my heart. March 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1770, I</l>
					<l>was taken into the great girls choir, which I lookt </l>
					<l>upon as as a great favour, and got a desire to live with</l>
					<l>the Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> which was granted me, and July 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1770.</l>
					<l>I went to live in the Sistrs Oeconomy at Gumersal, for </l>
					<l>which I was very thankfull to our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> but</l>
					<l>finding many things to <add place="above">go</add> <del>come</del> thro <del>with</del> which I did not</l>
					<l>expect, it went very hard with me for some years, I had</l>
					<l>not my health very well, and having now to feel more &amp; more</l>
					<l>every day, how poor and sinfull I was by nature I stood</l>
					<l>in need of the love and forbearance of the sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> and</l>
					<l>Sometimes thought I felt more then it was possible <add place="above">for me</add> to come</l>
					<l>thro&apos; with, which <del>it</del> would have been <add place="above">the case</add> had not my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lord</l>
					<l>Slept in, &amp; thro his tender loving and kind heart towards</l>
					<l>me help&apos;d me thro, which he <del>had</del> <add place="above">has</add> often done and always</l>
					<l><add place="above">prov'd</add> my friend; my forward and hasty Temper often causd me</l>
					<l>and the Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> pain, and no I now begun to feel the natural </l>
					<l>corruption and deep depravity which lay in me <add place="above">and</add> being very</l>
					<l>reserv&apos;d, I did not like to tell it and was afraid any Body</l>

					<l>Should see it in me, I kept it as I thought undiscoverd as</l>
					<l>long as I possibly could, but at last resolv&apos;d to keep it no</l>
					<l>was </l>
					<l>longer, but tell it without reserve just as it <del>is</del> <add place="above">was,</add> I did so</l>
					<l>and found by degrees <add place="above">that</add> I became more chearfull, and had more</l>
					<l>confidence to our dr Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, I had a great desire to be</l>
					<l>receiv&apos;d into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, which favour was granted me</l>
					<l>Feb<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1776 to my great abasement; it was an inexpress</l>
					<l>able grace and favour to me, <add place="above">and</add> I went on for sometime</l>
					<l>chearfullm, and was happy in the nearness of my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></l>
					<l>I thought then to be sure I should never feel <add place="above">myself</add> so bad as </l>
					<l>before, but alas this did not hold long; our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had</l>
					<l>many things to shew me, that I had not known before, he</l>
					<l>let me see and feel my self in such a manner as <add place="above">to be</add> and one <del>with</del> </l>
					<l><add place="above">and an entirely lost soul without him: and it</add> <del>out him a lost soul intirely this appear&apos;d</del> on all sides so </l>
					<l>dark &amp; Gloomy, as if I cou&apos;d not be help&apos;d, and in this sad</l>
					<l>state I went on for sometime, till on Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I</l>
					<l>was Spectator at the Holy Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> for this first time, this </l>
					<l>bowed me in the dust, and gave me a little incouragement</l>
					<l>that still our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Showed me mercy, and granted me</l>
					<l>this favour amidst all my Poverty, I felt a longing to </l>
					<l>injoy this highest good, but found that I was far from</l>
					<l>being clear, that my Lord had forgiven me everything,</l>
					<l>that there was something between him and me caus'd </l>
					<l>me great pain; in this situation I had many heavy</l>
					<l>days &amp; hours, and cou&apos;d not come in nightly to the Point,</l>
					<l>I wou&apos;d gladly have done somthing in my own Strength, but the more</l>
					<l>I strove, the darker I became, till at Length I could no longer </l>
					<l><note type="catchword">hold</note></l>

					<l>it out; I went alone into a room, where I fell on my knees</l>
					<l>before our Savr as an undone wretch, when he was pleasd</l>
					<l>to <add place="above">draw</add> near in so particular a manner, that all my distress left</l>
					<l>me in a moment, and my heart was enliven&apos;d with the sweet</l>
					<l>nearness of my best friend, and now I felt, that he had</l>
					<l>blotted out all my sins and iniquities, but at the same time</l>
					<l>it was as if Some one said to me What thou now hast</l>
					<l>received, thou hast Still to carry in an earthon Vesel; thou</l>
					<l>must not lean alone on this thou must have it renewed</l>
					<l>every day and hour out of my wounded heart; This grace</l>
					<l>I shall never forget and must thank our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> for it even in</l>
					<l>eternity; May y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1777 I was receivd into the Single Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></l>
					<l>Choir and on the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of the same month was Spectator the </l>
					<l>last time <add place="above">at the H. communion</add> for which I was very thankfull, and on the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></l>
					<l>of June. partook for the first time of the Lords Body and</l>
					<l>Blood, in the H Sacrament; what I felt then, is inexpressible;</l>
					<l>therefore I must remain Silent; since that time I have seen and</l>
					<l>felt many things that are not to the mind of my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, but</l>
					<l>thro&apos; ihs grace I have been able to come to him with every</l>
					<l>thing as a needy Sinner, who tho&apos; I was many times </l>
					<l>heavy and cast down on account of my inate corruption:</l>
					<l>yet found I had a mercifull Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, who could bear with </l>
					<l>all my infirmities; In the beggining of May 1778</l>
					<l>I was seiz'd with a bad Cold which increasing in its</l>
					<l>effects made me think, I might perhaps at this time go to </l>
					<l>our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>; with which our Late Sistr Closes her</l>
					<l>own account</l>
					<l>Her thoughts concerning going home, led her to a more</l>

					<l>Solid reflection &amp; particularly on the last moment, </l>
					<l>Which causd her some anxious concern as She was naturaly</l>
					<l>Timorous; but it was evident, that the Holy Ghost was</l>
					<l>carying on his work in her heart in order to prepare</l>
					<l>her for her happy end; and as her weakness increasd</l>
					<l>daily, it was thought proper for conveniency&apos;s sake</l>
					<l>to remove her to the Choir house here, where she came</l>
					<l>Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 9 into the sickroom, where she injoy&apos;d the frequent</l>
					<l>visits of the Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, particularly her Choir Lab<add>ouresses</add><del>ress</del> with </l>
					<l>whom she kept many hearty conversations about her</l>
					<l>poverty &amp; deficiency, on account of which she shed</l>
					<l>many Sinner tears before our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, accounting herself</l>
					<l>the poorest of all, tho&apos; it was perceptible, that our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></l>
					<l>at the same time did more on her then She was able to </l>
					<l>express, as She was of a Still turn of mind; about</l>
					<l>a week before her departure She spoke with great </l>
					<l>Clearness, how she felt concerning going to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>,</l>
					<l>that She now coud go to him, whenever he was pleasd</l>
					<l>to take <add place="above">her</add> which she longd very much for, since he had</l>
					<l>taken every thing away that causd fear, and there was</l>
					<l>nothing left that coud hinder her from resigning</l>
					<l>herself intirely into his hands, whenever the happy</l>
					<l>moment came, which She waited for with tender</l>
					<l>Longing, till <add place="above">in</add><del>on</del> the forenoon of Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, when </l>
					<l>she went over into the Arms of her Redeemer, with</l>
					<l>the Blessing of her Choir, in the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year of</l>
					<l>her Age</l>
