      <h2>John Astley</h2>
      <p><a href="#mlpla000059.html">Mirfield</a><em>April the 18th 1770</em>. The Life of the Md Br. <a href="#mlper000547.html">Jno Astley</a> who went
         						home <em>Apl 18 1770</em><br></br>My Dear Brn &amp; Sisters<br></br>It will without Doubt be Expected, that Some <br></br> Thing Should be Said of the Life of our departed Brother<br></br><a href="#mlper000547.html">John Astley</a>, for it is usual amongst us but as he <br></br> has left nothing from under his own Hand, and beside; <br></br> has told me little
         						or nothing by Word of Mouth, therefore <br></br> I want Materials. He told one: that He was Born in <br></br><a href="#mlpla000435.html">Lower Wyke</a> in the Year <em>1712</em>. and there learnd the <br></br> Trade of a
         							Shoemaker. and there like wise He Married<br></br> The presant Widow, being a Wild Wicked young Man &amp;c. </p>
      <p> But by the Preaching of our Late <a href="#mlper000640.html">B<sup>r</sup> Delamott</a>: <br></br> (who was invited
         						in to <a href="#mlpla000084.html">Yorkshire</a> by <a href="#mlper000536.html">M<sup>r</sup> Ingham</a>) he was <br></br> Brought upon Serious
         						thoughts, &amp; a Heartyconcern<br></br> about his Salvation, and that in this Situation of <br></br> Heart &amp; Mind he fell early in to the hands of the B<sup>rn</sup><br></br> who soon after his awakening came in to <a href="#mlpla000084.html">Yorkshire</a>, and <br></br> that by that Means, he was not only Happily preserv'd <br></br> from relapsing into his Former Course: but <sup>also</sup> by the Simple <br></br> and Evangelical Preaching of the
         							Brns, he became convinced of <br></br> our Sav<sup>rs</sup>unmeasurable love &amp; Grace for Sinners; and became <br></br> more, &amp; more acquainted, and Confident toward Him, and <br></br> Therefore began to value, &amp; love the Fellowship of the
         							Brethren<br></br> and beg'd for reception in to the Cong<sup>n</sup> He &amp; his Wife, had this <br></br> their Heartydesire Granted them as near as he could guess <br></br> in the Year <em>1747</em>. and were soon after admitted to the Holy <br></br> Communion, for the first time. He thought </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> It was the First communion which was kept in <a href=".html">Fulnek Hall</a><br></br> however be that as it will, it was the first to him in That Place, <br></br> and Numbred with Him; amongst his particular Hours of Grace!
         						<br></br> From that Day: He has maintain'd His communion with the <br></br>B<sup>rn</sup> to his Dying Hour, tho' it was often times, but slenderly &amp; <br></br> and with difficulty yet it never ceas'd realy.</p>
      <p> They were Married in the year <em>1733 in Feb<sup>r</sup></em> and had <br></br> a 11
         						Children 5 of whom are in the <a href=".html">Burying Ground</a> in <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulnek</a>; <br></br> one in <a href=".html">Hartshed Church</a>
         						yard, one Daughter, at <a href="#mlpla000035.html">Dukenfield</a>, and one <br></br> at <a href=".html">Ockbrook Choir House</a>. and the other three i.e. one Son,
         						and <br></br> two Daughters don't belong to us. they had once a little oeconomy<br></br> of Single B<sup>rn</sup> at their House in <a href="#mlpla000099.html">Hartshed</a>, but this was not their own <br></br> but
         						the B<sup>rns</sup> Projecting, but as it did not answer our Sav<sup>rs</sup> &amp;
         							the B<sup>rns</sup> purposes <br></br> it was soon Given up again.</p>
      <p> He has been her Some years, a pretty good steward<br></br> and Servant of the little Cong<sup>n</sup> in <a href="#mlpla000059.html">Mirfield</a>, and so has also
         						<br></br> His present Widow, and therefore his Memory must remain <br></br>Dear to us. He was a Child of Grace indeed, yet his life <br></br> was Chequer'd o'er with Grief and need.</p>
      <p> His Domestick affairs have bore a very indifrent <br></br> Trace these Many years, by which Means his credit was <br></br> reduced considerably; and this not only with Strangers,
         						<br></br> but partricularly So among our own People, therefore <br></br> I am rather inclin'd to Draw a vail over the Most part <br></br> of his Life. than to Expose it to Publick
         						view.</p>
      <p> However: all is Well, what End<sup>s</sup> Well. altho the beginning <br></br> and Middle had Some thing deploreable yet the end
         						was <br></br>adoreable. I have labour'd upon it from the beginning <br></br> of his Sickness to get his Mind off from all Eaternal <br></br>concerns, as he could Mend nothing in it, &amp; entreated Him </p>
      <p> to Fix his heart and Eyes on our Sav<sup>r</sup> and on his <sup>all</sup> atoneing <br></br> Sacrifice, which
         						advice he took Child-likely and became quite composed, <br></br> and Chearful in his Mind. we visited him pretty
         						often in order <br></br> to keep this Matter alive in his heart which has happily Succeeded <br></br> on <em>Easter
            								day</em> he Send for me, accordingly I went with 2 more Brethren<br></br> Pray'd heartily by Him, kept a little liturgy, by his Bedside, &amp; <br></br> gave him my last Blessing,
         						thinking he could not live till I could <br></br> come again. this little visit was attended with a most blessed feeling, <br></br> So
         						that I left him with a Heart quiteSatisfy'd.</p>
      <p> on <em>Easter Tuesday</em>, I and my Wife went to See him once more <br></br> I was quite Edify'd with his look &amp; Spoke tenderly to him, and <br></br> Sung Some Suitable verses for him, in which he join'd with us <br></br> which we could see by the moving of his lips,
         						this was the last <br></br>happy little visit, for: the next Monday Early, he fell Softly <br></br> and Happily asleep in his 58<sup>th</sup> year. </p>PAGE BREAK</body>
