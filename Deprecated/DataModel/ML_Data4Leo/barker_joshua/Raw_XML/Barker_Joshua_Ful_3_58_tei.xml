					<l>Departed March 24th 1761</l>
					<l>Our Brother Joshua Barker was born in the Year 1696,</l>
					<l>on the 22nd of December at Hopton in the Parish of Mirfield he lived with his</l>
					<l>Father till 19 Years of Age at which time he was put Apprentice to a Broad-Cloth-</l>
					<l>ier in that neighborhood, he was married to his present Widow the 13th of July</l>
					<l>1719 by whom he has had 8 Childrn two of whom went home in their Infancy</l>
					<l>and one at Mans Estate and of the 5 survising ones, one Son is a member of</l>
					<l>our Society, he liv&apos;d happily with his Wife and being of a religious turn he went</l>
					<l>with his Wife constantly to the Church &amp; Sacrament, and had religious Meet-</l>
					<l>ings kept in his house where they us&apos;d to pray and read Burkets Exposition on</l>
					<l>the new Testament; his self working was for some time in his way, so that to</l>
					<l>be a poor Sinner at the feet of Jesus was a hard matter to him for some time,</l>
					<l>and he was a long time among the Brn before he got a feeling of our Savrs Dying</l>
					<l>Love in his heart. When Mr Ingham preach&apos;d in the Beginning in these parts</l>
					<l>he went to hear him, his Wife at first was against it; but upon her hearing</l>
					<l>both Br Ockertshausen at her own house her Prejudice dropt away and they both went</l>
					<l>both together, he always had a great attachment to the Brn, and upon the his</l>
					<l>Land Lords being against the Preaching at his house, he rather left it than com-</l>
					<l>ply with his Desire not to let the Gospel be preach&apos;d there. He soon became</l>
					<l>a Member of our Society, and had the Grace to be receiv&apos;d on the 22d of April</l>
					<l>1752 into the Congn &amp; Nov. 19th in the same year he partook of the highest Good in</l>
					<l>the holy Sacrament for the first time. Within these 2 Years he has occasionally</l>
					<l>said to his Wife I shall not be long here but shall soon be go home, but don&apos;t be trou-</l>
					<l>bled for you will not stay long after me. At the regulating of the Bands and Classes</l>
					<l>anew in January 1760 he became a Band Servant, in which capacity he was a</l>
					<l>faithfull Helper &amp; belov&apos;d by his Brn, and found a Blessing for his own heart.</l>
					<l>On Monday night the 10th of November he was taken with a violent and pain-</l>
					<l>full Disorder so that his Disolution was expected before morning, the Vio-</l>
					<l>lence of which was however somewhat abated the next Day when he was visited</l>
					<l>by By Watson on his return from Huddersfield. He was very chearfull not-</l>
					<l>withstanding his great bodily Pain &amp; in a sinnerlike Connexion with the man</l>
					<l>of Sorrows, whom he said he longed to see face to face, &amp; beg&apos;d him and the </l>
					<l>Brn to bear him on their hearts, before Him on that account. From his first</l>
					<l>becoming sick he always thought he should yet Permission to leave his mor-</l>
					<l>tal Tent, and from hence be taken the faithfull one to see, at which he</l>
					<l>frequently rejoic&apos;d in his heart, &amp; speaking with a Brother of the great Long-</l>
					<l>ing he felt to be at home with his wounded Friend that only matchless</l>

					<l>Heart and observing his Wife looked thoughtfull, he said to her when I am</l>
					<l>with him I will speak a good Word for you, that he may soon fetch you also</l>
					<l>and I&apos;m sure he will not deny me my Request and this he comforted her about</l>
					<l>their parting. Soon after the Sacrament, being visited by a Br he express&apos;d</l>
					<l>his great Longing for that highest Good, in order to strengthen his heart under</l>
					<l>the great bodily pain he felt and declared that the better Death and Passion of</l>
					<l>the Lord Jesus was what his heart rely&apos;d upon and his its only Good for time &amp; </l>
					<l>Eternity. Once being visited he express&apos;d his Desire to be buried with his Brn</l>
					<l>at Lambs Hill and seemed grieved that on account of his outward Circumstances</l>
					<l>he must give up that hope but he was soon comforted upon our assuring</l>
					<l>him we wou&apos;d see to it that his desire shou&apos;d be accomplish&apos;d. Jan 21st he had</l>
					<l>his past of the holy Sacrament with some other sick for which End he came on Horse-</l>
					<l>back to the to the Chapel which was the last time of his being there. On the</l>
					<l>Great Sabbath Br Watson carried him the Sacramt, and first related to him what</l>
					<l>had had pass&apos;d in the Congn at G.H. on Maunday Thursday and then in a child</l>
					<l>like Prayer Prayer beg&apos;d that mouth which spoke his own clean, to speak this</l>
					<l>Br who could not enjoy the Application of the bloody Gore from his Back in ye</l>
					<l>Aeditarium on account of Sickness clean, and to hasten the ripening of this fruit</l>
					<l>of his Deaths Agony &amp; take him home to himself or soon enable him to appear</l>
					<l>again among his Brn. Then he sung: What Lord thee so tormented &amp;c. O led him in</l>
					<l>thy nail holes see his Pardon &amp; Election free &amp;c. Give him absolution, and a gen-</l>
					<l>tle praising Tone, deep Foundation in thy Cross&apos;s Stem, and then during an </l>
					<l>inexpressible tender &amp; melting feeling he receiv&apos;d his share of the holy Sacramt</l>
					<l>after which he was particularly chearfull and happy and frequently said to his</l>
					<l>Wife, now I have got what I wanted, and seem&apos;d highly blessed. That Night</l>
					<l>was a very painfull night to him and his Disorder very became again very vio-</l>
					<l>lent. On Monday being visited by one of the Brn to whom he again signified his</l>
					<l>Longing to be at home which Desire was granted him the next day in the Eve-</l>
					<l>ning about 8o&apos;clock after having lain quiet &amp; still from about 4o&apos;clock with-</l>
					<l>out speaking, he sweetly fell asleep &amp; grew pale on Jesus arm &amp; Bosom, in ye</l>
					<l>65th year of his dying Life, with that Childrens Watch Word; all that</l>
					<l>are in the Graves shall hear his voice. Now there&apos;s no Soul who doth</l>
					<l>not want (ev&apos;n when in her Lords Joy) and doth not quick upon the Grant</l>
					<l>fetch her Corpses revrently.</l>
