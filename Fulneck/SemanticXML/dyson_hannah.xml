					Hanna Dyson
					<l />
					I was born at Kerkstill in the parish of Kerkhetten in the Year 1728 My Father was a
					Clothmaker In my young Years my parents sent me to School Till I was so
					old that I could do some service at home I was of a very brisk &amp; Lively turn of mind
					And I perceived often that if God did not preserve me I should run into uter ruing as I felt
					My basness &amp; inclination there to stir very much in me my Father &amp; Mother was always
					for there Children going to <del>school</del> Church very Constant &amp; I got a great Liking thereto
					As I alwas lik'd to here what I could there &amp; when ever I went to Church I uste to pray
					the Lord to bless me very earnestly &amp; to bestow great blessing on me I uste to be very
					Much Consernd but did not then understand ye meaning thereof One time being in
					Very great Distress I went out in the Barn to pray &amp; as I pray'd I wisht to God
					that he would answer me my prayer and preserve &amp; keep me to the end of my days
					and make me his faithfull Servent but in a perticular Manner I pray'd that he would
					Give me his grace at that time, which might endure throought all the Days of
					My Life One Night I Drempt that we had Company &amp; I going to attend
					on them on a Low flower I ment to men the One <del>was</del> was Drest in dark Collor
					and the Other in a Long read Robe <add place="above">he that was in black</add>
						<del>One</del> ask'd me wether <del>of them I should chose</del>
					I was agoing I told him about my busyness he then ask'd me wich of them
					too I shoud chose, I then arnesty Looked on them both but did not directly give
					it Answer he said wether did I chose Heaven &amp; Hell I said one always chose
				
			</p>

			<p>
				
					Heaven you know he ask'd me again which of us then do you chuse I answerd
					him hastily not you, but this and standing nearest him in the Red Robe
					I got hold on him he then smiled at me &amp; bowed his Head I also moved to
					him and got hold of the robe and wanted to look what was under it he then
					smiled again and bow'd his Head &amp; said not yet I then was very much ashamed
					that I made so free with him, but he held out his hand &amp; Smiled I then Looking
					down to the Ground lost sight of them both and so I awaked with a deep Soncern
					On my mind just then about there was a great talk about some prechers
					that sung hymns &amp; pray'd &amp; precht in Barns and particularly Mis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ingam who was
					just then come out of Jorde they called him a new found pretcher and so my Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
					And me whent one Night to here <add place="above">him</add> But he mist that Night coming where he
					should have precht &amp; so we must here him On my rode I went with some Body
					who lent me a little hymn Book I Learnt some verses there by which I uste
					frequently to sing soon after this my Mother fell sick &amp; whent in to a Consomtion
					And dyd I then thought I had Lost one of my best friends I could have but being
					then left with my Father &amp; Grandmother she was very good to me &amp; kept me
					very close to my Book especialy asundays so that I might get amoungst
					no saught of lose Company, soon after my Mother Departer my Father also
					who was really a good &amp; tender father over his Children
					Dyd I then whent to service being in my 13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> Year I then begun to get more into
					things belong to the would which sated my inclination but as I had been brought up in another
					way I was not always satisfied there with becaus I did not <add place="above">know</add> there ways rightly <del>My</del>

					At one place where I was I fell sick &amp; got the ague where I was obliged to live
					My place I had about a duzen or 14 Mile to go back to my native place
					And over Larg Commons to some where my master brought me alone back to the
					Last Common to so biding Farewell to him I sat me down &amp; began to weep heartily
					Being exceeding Burdend with my Cloths &amp; so weak that I scarsely say any means of
					getting to my Unkle where I was agowing &amp; have no right home to go to made
					it very heard to me But I prayd to God that he would help &amp; direct me how
					to go on I wept in a perticular manner thinking that with not praying sickness
					had come upon me Now I was not Long destant for ahome as my Ant
					in a few Days sent for me &amp; said I should stay as Long as my sickness
					Lasted which was a great while but she behaved as a tender mother over me
					I then being quit recoverd <del>I</del> went to Harchet to see my Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> And soon after
					then I wen to here Mis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ingam at Fox rode at Mirfeild he preached on 63<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> Chap<hi rend="superscript:true;"
							>r</hi>
					O Ezah who is this that cometh from edom with dyd Garmants for Bozrah this that
					is Glorous in his aperel Traveling in the Greatness of his strength
					I was very much tuched at <add place="above">this</add> and though I never heard such preaching in my Life
					Soon after I begin to here the Bretheren &amp; I was exceeding miserable thinking that all
					Preching &amp; praying prevailed nothing on me but that I should be Lost &amp; mend
					forever One Night I was exceedngly overcome with terror &amp; fright thinking
					that I should go to hell &amp; so should never be saved But in a little while I begun to grow
					eager &amp; so being by my self at my busyness all at once I was exceeding seazed upon for
					Our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> at that time manifested him self before my Heart and I say as
					Clearly as if I had seen him Crucifyed before my eyes that Left such an imprestion
					upon me that I was obliged to set down and I was quiet surprised what was
					come to me <del>but</del>
						<add place="above">and</add> as miserable as I was before so happy was that after for <del>I believed</del>
					was, so that they perceived my chearfullness was well so my pease was
					I <del>had</del> was often spoken with &amp; told that both going to hear ther prechers I was
					growne quite molencolly and <del>again</del> after a little while I begun to grow miserable
					again, but I gladly would have overcome it with like mindedness and things belonging
					to this world thinking there by to have Satisfaction &amp; strove against it as much
					as lade in my power. one Sunday as I whent to Church (and always going to ran ahead)
					I though I would miss &amp; so going home I got to my Companons as soon as possible
					and while we where to gether the Master of the house cameing &amp; we whent but but he
					said as long as we was so altogether (and me amongst them) there would never be no
					good done which struck me so when I heard him that I left my Companions
					I made a resolution to mis the pritching no more and so but of &amp; when <del>but to</del> rawhead
					but the preaching was half over then after a little while I begun to think that I
					could like to belong to the society accordingly I whent to Bro<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ockerhousen
					and told them my mind &amp; Intention they askued me if I had quite Lost my
					inclination for the things of this world &amp; how a soul should be that was a
					County member how was they gave me Leave to go to the county she next
					time so as soon as my Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> perceived that I would belong to the Bretheren

			<p>
				
					She begun to think that I was better then her which caused a great dissagrement
					betwen us Brother &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ockerhousen got ordered me to go to Kane Wartons
					where I sayed near too year &amp; from thence I removed to Cleckheaton to Live
					with Sarah rite &amp; her Mother being engaged some where else &amp; <del>there I stayed</del>
					from thence I removed in the Oeconomy when it begun at Clekheaton
					the same year the 22<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> of May <del>the same Y</del> I was received into the Congregation
					soon after I began to think very much about the Lordsupper &amp; the Year
					following I became a Candidate in May when Broth Johanas &amp; Benigna
					was here &amp; on the 10<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> of July I had the Grace to be a pertaker for the first time
					Which in deed was every particular Grace &amp; Bless for my poor heart &amp; found
					it was a real food for my soul here I found my dear Saviour Begun a
					new school with me the Next Year after I removed from Cleckheaton
					to the home Oeconomy where I stayed about a Year &amp; then I removed
					to the Low house to that Oeconomy &amp; from thence to the Toop of the Hill
					Hear it was quite a new beganing to me &amp; found it often very
					needfull to beg our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> for Grace to help me thro' with soon after I removed
					To the hall to weight on the Bretheren &amp; Sister where I served about 2 Years
					??? true I look on this as a great favour I found it was great
					Blessing to me to be amongst the Brethren &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> &amp; to serve
					them next I removed in to the Choir House but here I found it difficulter
					then ever I often pray'd to my Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to help me thro' with every thing
					after awhile I midst the Lords supper on the account of which I did find
					it still hard to be a sinner But I pray'd Our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> that he would for give
					Me and take me again as his poor Sinner which he really did in
					Our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> gave me Leave to enjoy that highest good the next time
					The tim after I mist again but I had leave to go the time following
					Now soon after this <add place="above">the</add> a place Congregation was settled which was put very
					Close to us and was told us what would be required of every
					Broth &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
						<add place="above">belonging in</add>
						<del>must do</del> a place Congregation this was a perticular matter to me
					and especialy as times was very Critical with me I could not just resolve what
					to do firs we had it told by Bro<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Johanas in the Great Hall when
					was realy a Strikeing matter to me after wards in our owne meeting
					Hall at firs it put me a little to it but soon I saw there was no way but
					to give my self intirely to our Saviour to be his &amp; what he pleas'd to do
					with me &amp; that day I never forgot <del>it</del> soon after this I mist the Lordssupper
					again then I begun to reason very much &amp; wounderd what was the matter
					that things whent so heard I when by myself into the Burying Ground 
					and prayd our Saviour that he would make it Clear to me if it was my
					right place to be here or no for I realy was quite far &amp; I did not
					know what to think &amp; if he had some other view with me he would
					make me satisfyd that have ever I might have some Satisfaction. 
					my Life some times I prayed our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> that if he had some other
					view with me that he would bless my heart &amp; give me a Grace which
					I felt he very often did

			<p>
				Now I begun to think wether I had done right or not with asking our Sav
				so far but soon after I became quite Satisfyed &amp; I was clear in my Heart
				our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> was Satisfyed tho' things whent on but poorly soon after it was
				told me Conserning going to the Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> hous at Beedforde I had not the
				Least objections to make on this account but I found it so in my
				Heart that if our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; his Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> ordered it so with me I was
				quite Satisfyd tho' I cant say but it caused me a deal of pain
				to leave this dear place Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> where I had so sensible felt my
				dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> nearness. We set out on ye 18<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> of June in the year 60 with
				the Blessing of the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> &amp; on the 24<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> we arrived in Bedford in the
				Sisrs House here Our Savr begun <del>quite a new school with our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi></del>
					<add place="above">began quite a new school with me</add> &amp; I felt
				I stood in need of his nearness in a prticular manner &amp; I often keep band
				with my dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to Comfort me for I felt the want of this dear place
				Congregation so much that sometimes I could not be satisfy'd but after
				awhile I begun to be better Satisfyed for I believed it was the place for me
				[Illegible]<lb/>
				[Illegible]<lb/>
				[Illegible]<lb/>
				[Illegible]<lb/>
				[Illegible]<lb/>
				After awhile here [Illegible]<lb/>
				[Illegible]<lb/>
				Then I begun to think that if I could live the Bretheren I should have
				nothing against if But as our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> who always steeped before my
				Heart Comforted me at that time also not long after it was told me
				I should come again to fullneck which I received with a glad heart
				and when I got to my dear Choir hous again I beged our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to
				grant me bouth the Old &amp; new feeling which I can truly say he has now
				But I haveing a very sickly Tabernickel since the time of my comeing
				it has often caused me perplexity on account of my Comeing thro'
				???? at my turn the General Synod being &amp; here what our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> had to say
				to the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> it affected me very much I thought I must take a great
				part there in I often uste to go out &amp; beg our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to make a new begin with me
				And he did frequently steep before my Heart &amp; Comfort me. In Ocktob<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
				I feel sick so that I thought <del>that</del> our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> would take me to himself but how
				ever it did not happen at that time Our Savr has had a perticular schooling with
				<del>Savr</del> me which in the end has proved perticularly blesst to me this year has been
				a very sickly one with me so that I often felt my self very weakly which has
				made me think often Our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> perhaps intended to take me to himself &amp; I do
				Injoy his nearness in a perticular manner
