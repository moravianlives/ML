A Sketch of the life & happy
departure of Mary Ann Foster who
died at Bristol, April 9th 1789.
From her cradle to her death it may
be said that she was an affectionate
& pleasing child, discovering an
uncommon sensibility in all things
for one of her age. As early as three
years old she frequented the Childrens
Meetings at the Brethen's Chapel;
it was evident that he tender mind
was impressed not with dread but
with a pleasant serenity whenever
she heard of death & going to dwell with
our Saviour, On attening the 
funeral of a Child about her own
age, she afterwards asked one of
her companions, if she should like to
die & be buried like Maria Grinfield
(who died at the age of three years & a quarter)
her companion replied "no" to which
she she said, I am sure I should


for thou I should for to my dear
Saviour -- on being asked if she
did not fear the Gloomy grave "Oh no
she replied our Saviour was laid in
the Grave & I am not afraid, my soul
will go to him when I die, & I shall 
be drest in white & praise him with
all the little Angels for ever & ever!"
The discourse delivered at that
funeral made a deep impression on
her tender heart she went home to her
Momma & relative all she could
remember of it & said she should
ask her forgiveness as Maria did of
her Momma & Papa before she died
adding, my dear Momma, you will I
know frogive me for our Saviours sake
because I am his, he has only lent me
to you for a little while, her Papa said,
"Maryann what is it you say," she replies
Papa you would not understand it if I told
you, but Momma does. In her morning
and evening prayers she entreted her dear


Savivor to forgive her all her Sins &
prepare her for his heavnly Kingdom that
she would thank him for all his love
while here & sing his praises for ever
she often concluded with this verse
out of her little hymn book
But Saviour dear thou for my good
Wast pleased a child to be
And thou didst shed thy precious blood
Upon the cross for me. 
Come then & take this heart of mine
O take me as Iam
I know that I by right am thine
Thou loving gracious Lamb.
She could often remark on the Lords
goodness to her and say that she wanted
for no good thing, while many poor
Children were in wants of every thing tho'
she was no better then they were; On
Easter day she asked why it was so called
she was told because our Saviour rose
in the east and then said, what shall
in heaven? her friend replied, we shall
sing the song of Moses and the Lamb" Oh
that will be delightful she said, how I long to
die that I may go to my dear Saviour, then 


I shall love him more for I shall see him
and be with him for ever. In the night
season, she would often wake and say
here is dorkness, in heaven there is always
light our dear Saviour is the light & the glory
there we shall sing the with the Angels
Hallelujah praise the Lord. One morning
hearing the servant singing a vain song,
she went to her & repeated the following verse
"Stop poor sinner stop and think
Before you further go
Will you sport upon the brink
Of evrlasting one?
O Molly, said she you are not singing
our Saviours praise, if you do not begin
here, you never will in heaven, remember
I told you so & if ever you tell his, you will
go the bottomless pit, where Satan is, Oh
Molly repent and call on our Saviour for
Mercy, that you may be saved. On the
Saturday before her last illness she went to
dine with a friend, and appeared
uncommonly thoughtful, & was asked if any
thing had greivd her -- no; but I have a
secret to tell you, but Momma must not
know it because it will wet her but she will


know it by and bye, dear Maryann what
can that be, that your Momma must not
know, she replied with a frightened
countenance, I an going to leave you
not to London where Momma thinks to send
me to school, & has so many new dresses for
me, but I shall want none of them
for I shall have a dress where I am going
which shall be always white & looking
up to heaven with her little hands
folded together she said, I am going
far above those clouds I am going
to My dear Saviour, who is in heaven, he
will give a crown of gold & a white robe
& I shall lay my crown at his feet & I will
fall down at his feet & worship him
with all the little Angels in white, her
friend said, how will you know our
Saviour for we read in the Revelations
that St John was mistaken & was
going to worship an Angel instead
of the Lord Jesus, she said, I 
shall not mistake for our dear Saviour
was crusified, you know they nailed


him to the Cross by his hands & by
his feet, & they peirced his side, I 
shall know him by his wounds, & I will
Sing in heaven hallelujah praise
the Lord & All hail the power of Jesus home
Let Angels prostrate fall
Bring forth the royal children
And crown him Lord of all
The week following on the 4th of April
she was seized with a putrid sore throat
And fever, she suffered with such
uncommon patience as astonished
all around her, to a friend that
visited her she said with a smile
I am doing to sing the song Moses
& the Lamb before you dear Momma
do not grieve for me, I am soon going
to our dear Saviour, he has only lent
me to you for a little while if you lose
me you will give me up to him, do
no cry because Maryann is going to
heaven, you will come by & bye, we shall
meet again Momma let one he burried
like the Sisters & let all the Sisters have


gloves and ribbons and meet around my
coffin with the Minister to sing verses, and
afterwards follow me in white to the grave
her Momma answered her that ii should
be as she wished desired, she  also begged
that her coffin might be like Maria
Grinfield's which was granted, she
said, I should like so be buried in
the Chapel burying ground, but I
cannot expec that, as I am not in the
Society you know but never mind,
my soul will be with our dear Saviour,
my body shall rise from the pithole
Sr Jones's so that is no matter but
when the weather is fine, will you
visit my grave sometimes to remember
Maryann? on the night before her
departure, she attempted to sing
Hallelujah praise the Lord which
she had often done, but now her throat
was so bad that she could only repeat
the words - The next day about noon
not being able to speak her dear little
hands folded together with her lips


moving in the attitude of prayer
then her spirit calmly departed
into the hands of him who gave it
being aged only 4 years and a half.
