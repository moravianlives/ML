The Course of Life of the Single Sistr
Hanh Whitly, concerning of which she has left the following.
I was born at Lightcliff in the Parish of Halifax in the year 1733 and
baptiz'd in the Church of England, My Mother departing this Life, When
I was about a year old My Uncle took me to care for till my ninth
year, When I was put apprentice to Joseph Oates of Norwood Green
Who at that time entertain'd, Mr Ingham, and Br Dellamotte, to who
preached in his House. Somtime after Br and Sistr Held came
to Yorkshire, and took on them the care of the Children; they
kept a Loveleast with us and Settled us in bands, & of which I
had the favour to be in One. The feeling I got at that time I
can't express; tho' but a Child, I felt my heart was bound in
a Covenant with my mercifull Savr, and he made it clear
to me, that I belong'd to him, and His people, tho' I did not
always abide by that Impression, but came into hours of distress
and darkness, at which times, he proserv'd me so that nothing
was able the divert or draw me of from his people; tho' I had
many difficulties to Struggle with, Yet he at me feel that he
was Stedfast, whenever I was willing to rely on him alone, and
not Seek to help my self. About this time an Oeconimy of
Sistrs was begun at OxHays, Which prov'd a great Blessing
and Benifit to me; I came more into fellowship with the Sistrs
Yet was not Satisfied as I had not yet perceiv'd that pardoning
Kiss from my dr Savr asuring me of the forgiveness of all my Sins;
I spoke my mind to one of my Companions, who told me to cast my
self Just as I was, at the feet of my Dr Savr and believe that
He wou'd accept me, which I accordingly did, and was not disapointed
for he graciously Own'd me his Poor Child, so that I was for
Sometime Quite in a rapture, thro' the feeling Sense of his Nearness;
but this Joy did not last long, which together with Circumstances
Occuring in the Family where I Liv'd, and the Sistrs Removal
from the Oeconomy, Made my Course very heavy.


as I now had neither the oportunity of speaking with the Sistrs
nor ever hearing the preaching, being Oblig'd to go with my Mistress
to the Methodist Meetings which it went very hard with me. this
Continued 4 year, when to my great Joy I had the pleasure to see
Sistr Mary (the then Choir helper of the Single Sistrs) for the first
time, she spoke very tenderly to me and Comforted me in my great
distress, after which I was re'd into the Society, but coud still
not go to the meetings which causd me much pain, My Dr
Sistr Mary, asur'd me she wou'd do her best for me, that I
should lose nothing which lay in for power. I was still not
satisfied, till by means of Br Gross I got leave to go to the
Meetings, for which I was very thankfull and injoy'd that
privilege once a fornight during the last year of my apprentiship.
in this time I often felt my own Misery and depravity to
such a degree, that it was as if the Condemnation on account of all
bad things lay upon me, and I cou'd find no Comfort. My
time being almost out my Master desir'd me to stay longer
with Him which adding to my perplexity I made my mind
known to Sistr Mary, Who advis'd me do as I felt in my own
heart; this brought me to a Solid reflection, and I often pray'd
our Savr to renew my call to me and make it Quite clear
to me that I belong'd to the Congn Whenever I shou'd obtain leave
to Live with the Sistrs. Augst 18 1756 I unworthy Child, had
the favour to come into the Oeconimy at Gumersall, where
according to my desire, it was clear to me from the first hour
that now I was in my right place, where I belong'd, which has
been a Support and Comfort to me. During my abode with the
Sistrs, thro' all difficulties, I went on Chearfull, and spent my
time Happy as a poor Sinner, and had the grace to be read
into the Congn Jany the 6 1756 to my unexpected Joy and
abatement; This was a real Comfort to me, amidst the
feeling of my own depravity, which my Dr and unwearied


Savr made me from time to time more Sencible of just so as I poor Child
was able to bear it. when I was spoke to about the Lords Supper
I felt a great deal, but my ardent prayer was that Our Savr
might make me a right happy poor Sinner, that I might not
receive the Holy Sacrament to my Detriment, desiring him to wash
my heart in his most precious blood that so I might be a fit
canditate for it, this time was a real blessing to me, wherein
I felt his rich comfort amidst my poverty and weakness both of
body and mind, Augst 13 1757 I was spectator at the Holy Comunion
Which increasd my Longing desire to injoy that Highest Good,
Tho' conscious of my unworthiness, Yet I spent my time more
Chearfull, in reliance on him knowing his time wou'd be the
best, Septr 2 1758 I injoy'd this Grace to my deep humiliation
which blessing I hope to remember till I shall grow pale
in his Arms, Thus I spent my time in his nearness as a poor
faulty Creature, asham'd to think what patience my dr Savr
has had with me from my very Birth; as well as the love
and tenderness of the sistrs towards me Whilst in the Oeconimy,
July 18 1760 I had the unexpected pleasure to move in to the
Choir house at fullneck
Our late Sister ends for own account with a few lines to the
Helper of the Choir as follows
Now my Dr and tenderly beloved
Sistr Lorel I pray you to exuse me entering any further in
on my poor Lifes course as I am not able, So much I can say
my Desire has been from the first Moment that I might Live
according to Our Savrs mind, poor as I am, and have been all
all my Life. May but his will be fullfilld in me, whatever
pain my Body may go thro' tis no concern to me, I am His
He may do whatsoever is pleasing in his sight with this unworthy
Child. Her heart was tenderly atach'd to Our Savr, and
Her Election of Grace to be among his people, was a matter of Joy
and thankfullness thro her whole course, and Our Savrs
faithfullness


to her kept her in a feeling sense of her own depravity, So
that she knew herself and the Grace to injoy what he had
merited for her, which she often declard with tears, was more
then the derserv'd, in all variations in her Course among the Sistrs
none gave her such sensible pain, as when she had greiv'd our Savr
who had redeem'd her from all things, which cou'd deprive her
of the injoyment of comfort and peace from him, The Sacramental injoy
ment of the Body and Blood of our Lord she esteemed the greatest grace
and was truly sensible that he Own'd her and wou'd stand by her
when all things fail'd, her Lively Disposition made her troublesome
Disorder which more or less afflicted her for many years, bearable,
and whenever her Cough & astma caus'd her the most trouble she show'd
a Childlike Resignation with Chearfullness to await, what our Savr wou'd
do with Her, as soon as she got a little relievd; she soon forgot her Suff'rings,
Spent her time in Sinnerlike Chearfullness among the Sistrs the repeated
return of her Cough brought her very Low, and so weak that about
3 months ago she began to take to the Sick room, yet agreably to her
her hearts disposition she was able to go about till the very Last, and
thereby injoy'd the fellowship with her room Sistrs whereby they had
hopes that she might Recover, and grow in her usual way little better,
but she seem'd as if she expected a Sudden Call into Her Lords Joy; and
Spoke very seriously to her Sistrs on that account, about a month ago
She exprest herself thus. "it is as if our Savr had taken all care and
concern from me, and I have nothing on my mind, If he pleases to take me,
I go to him as a poor helpless worm, he has forgiven me all, and if He
shou'd take me unexpected to you; it will not be unexpected to me; Pray dont
be uneasy about me, I am His, His will be done with me his unworthy Sinner."
nothing particular was perceiv'd, but that she grew more weak
and consequently her Cough more troublesome; on Fryday evening Sept 28
She sent for a Sistr desiring her to settle some little matters for her
Saying: "one cant tell what may happen, His gracious will be done, I fear
nothing ,whatever pain he pleases to lay on me, if he is but near me, thats
enough for me. She had a tolerable night, and was next morning lively
and Chearfull as usual among her Room Companions, in the evening the
Doctor came into the sickroom, found her chearfull and as he thought better
then she had been, but he had scarcely left the House, before Her precious Soul
took flight into the Arms of Her beloved with the blessing of Her Choir in the 38 year of her age
