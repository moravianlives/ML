					<l>The single Sr Martha Calvert who</l>
					<l>departed this life March 15th 1816,</l>
					<l>has left the following short account,</l>
					<l>which she dictated Sept 13th 1813.</l>
					<l>I was born Oct 19th 1743 in Idle,</l>
					<l>in my 3d year I moved with my</l>
					<l>parents into Pudsey, they belonging</l>
					<l>to the Brns Congn as soon as I</l>
					<l>was old enough took me to the </l>
					<l>Childrens meeting, where I remem</l>
					<l>ber as a very little Child being</l>
					<l>told to pray to our Saviour to </l>
					<l>wash our hearts in his blood,</l>
					<l>and when I came home, I </l>
					<l>often went into a corner, and</l>
					<l>repeated these words as well as</l>
					<l>I could. March 25th 1756 I </l>
					<l>was added to the great Girls Choir,</l>
					<l>which day proved a great blessing</l>
					<l>to me, and from that time I </l>
					<l>felt an earnest desire to come to </l>
					<l>live in Fulnek, this favour was</l>

				<lg>
					<l>granted to me May 21st 1759. I </l>
					<l>was now very happy and comfort</l>
					<l>able, felt quite at home, and </l>
					<l>thought I wanted nothing more.</l>
					<l>The 13th of Nov. the same year I</l>
					<l>was rec&apos;d into the Congn with 26</l>
					<l>others; having made no previous </l>
					<l>application for this favour, I </l>
					<l>was much struck when my name</l>
					<l>was read in the Caple, but I </l>
					<l>prayed fervently to our Saviour</l>
					<l>that his aim might be obtained</l>
					<l>with me. Jan. 18th 1760 I was </l>
					<l>spectator at the H. Comn from</l>
					<l>this time till the 29th of Aug.</l>
					<l>the same year, when I had the </l>
					<l>favour to enjoy this sacramental</l>
					<l>food for the first time, was a </l>
					<l>period which I shall never forget,</l>
					<l>when I learned to know my own </l>
					<l>depravity and sinfulness, and our</l>
					<l>Saviour manifested himself to</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>my heart in a particular manner as</l>
					<l>my Redeemer. I learned to know</l>
					<l>that without him I could do nothing,</l>
					<l>which proved a good and holesome</l>
					<l>School to me, and after this I </l>
					<l>went on for sometime in a hap</l>
					<l>py course. In my 21st year, Br</l>
					<l>Nitshman spoke individually with </l>
					<l>our whole Choir, it has always been</l>
					<l>impressed on my mind how fer</l>
					<l>vently he recommended me to our</l>
					<l>Saviour. After the Synod in 1764</l>
					<l>was a very searching time in this </l>
					<l>Congn, which was also to me of great</l>
					<l>importance, I sensibly felt how</l>
					<l>short I fell of what I ought to</l>
					<l>be, which humbled me at the Lords</l>
					<l>feet to seek grace and pardon, and </l>
					<l>when the whole Congn had missed</l>
					<l>the H. Comn for 3 successive </l>
					<l>times, the feeling which pervaded</l>
					<l>us all when we again had the</l>
				</lg>

			<pb xml:id='IMG_1184.jpg' n='4'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>favour to meet at the Lords table</l>
					<l>words cannot express. To say much</l>
					<l>more concerning my pilgrimage</l>
					<l>here below, I am not able, nor</l>
					<l>has any thing very striking accur</l>
					<l>red, my Saviour has dealt has</l>
					<l>with me as a kind and tender</l>
					<l>Father, lead me on by degrees</l>
					<l>as I was able to bear it, and </l>
					<l>kept his faithful hand over me</l>
					<l>in many trying hours of temptation.</l>
					<l>When I therefore now look back</l>
					<l>how I have spent my time, my</l>
					<l>only plea is; &quot;God be merciful to</l>
					<l>me a sinner.&quot; I find abundent</l>
					<l>cause to thank and adore my kind</l>
					<l>Redeemer for all his love and faith</l>
					<l>fulness towards me in every respect;</l>
					<l>in my imply he has blessed me</l>
					<l>that I have wanted for nothing </l>
					<l>and often when I was sweeping</l>
					<l>the Sleeproom, and being with</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>my Saviour alone, I have had many</l>
					<l>happy hours, when I could simply</l>
					<l>lay my case before him. Now</l>
					<l>when I am not able to do any</l>
					<l>thing, the time will now and then</l>
					<l>apear long to me, but I pray</l>
					<l>to him to strenghten my faith and</l>
					<l>confidence, and to prepare me</l>
					<l>for his heavenly kingdom, I am</l>
					<l>very thankful that I am able</l>
					<l>to attend the meetings, which prove</l>
					<l>a great comfort and refreshment</l>
					<l>to my heart.</l>
					<l>Our late Sr did not think when </l>
					<l>she dictated this, that she still</l>
					<l>should remain so long in this</l>
					<l>vale of tears, her patience was</l>
					<l>often tried, but she prayed earnest</l>
					<l>ly to the Lord for help and sup</l>
					<l>port; as long as long as she was</l>
					<l>able, she faithfully attended the </l>
					<l>Chaple, where she found food and </l>

					<l>an other hard trial, but the Lord</l>
					<l>gave her grace to bear this and </l>
					<l>other afflictions with patience, </l>
					<l>tho&apos; she often longed for the time </l>
					<l>to be with him, she would fre</l>
