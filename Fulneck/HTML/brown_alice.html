      <p> from a child She was never without Convictions, and as soon y<sup>e</sup><br/>Brethren came to <a href="#mlpla000035.html">Duckenfield</a>, She was one y<sup>e</sup>
         						&amp; first Children wich was <br/> takes under y<sup>e</sup>B<sup>rns</sup> care, y<sup>e</sup>tenderLongingof her heart is become truly acquaintd <br/> with our Saviour, <sup>and</sup> to know
         						for her own individual; her Grace of Election in y<sup>e</sup><br/> Wounds of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>, was plainly felt and seen in all his Actions; She Us'd <br/> often to go alone by her Self, in to <sup>the</sup> fields, and when she Could get in to a <br/> privet place prostrated her self on y<sup>e</sup> ground, before our Saviour, beging him <br/> for his Death and Bloods Sake, to bestow upon her, that happiness, and <br/> full
         						pardon in his Wounds, which she felt, as belived was to be attain'd <br/> to; even wile in this Body, in this sittuation She went on, till she had obtain'd
         <br/> what her
         							heart wanted; of this blest course of Grace, which our Saviour<br/> begun with her wile a Child; She Us'd afterwards to relate with <br/>plesuer; and it always came from her with such a tender felling, that <br/> Who ever heard her speak thereof Could
         						not but be Sencably back'd, <br/> In y<sup>e</sup><em>Year 1744</em> She left her Parents, and lived with her three <br/> Brothers and two Sisters, Who on account of their Mother, being <br/> at
         						that time of a different way of thinking from them, had taken a <br/> house them Selves; in order to follow their Course with y<sup>e</sup> Brethren <br/>
         						more to their own Satisfaction, she lived thus about half a year <br/> and then she with her two Sister, and a few more, made y<sup>e</sup> begining <br/> of a little Oeconomy, which lasted about a year and half, when on some <br/> Ocations, it was
         						thought fit for that House-keeping to be broke up, <br/> And such had <sup>it</sup> propos'd to them, to go to their homes again, <br/> This proved a great grife, to our depated Sister, and She with her Christ <br/> Sister Resolve'd not to go back to their parents, but to live together
         						<br/> till our Saviour Should see fit to make out some way for them, which <br/> Accordingly happen'd, that very year, When <a href=".html">Brother</a>, and <a href="#mlper000117.html">Sister <br/> Hackenwelter</a> came thither, Who Approved him
         						self as a faithful<br/> Father in helping y<sup>e</sup> Sisters, as far as lay in his Power, and Capability <br/> our Departed Sister; whome they Look'd upon as their own
         						Child in all <br/> this time, our Saviour carried on <sup>his</sup> Worke of Gracein her heart, in a manner <br/> not to be discribed, but which at y<sup>e</sup> same time was very Decernable to all
         						<br/> who knew her, </p>
      <p><em>April y<sup>e</sup> 23<sup>d</sup> 1748</em>She was Recived in to y<sup>e</sup>Congregation, <br/> and on <em>Aug<sup>st</sup> y<sup>e</sup>
            								13<sup>th</sup> in y<sup>e</sup> same year</em>She was made a partaker of y<sup>e</sup><br/> Corpess and blood of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>; in y<sup>e</sup> holy Sacrament, <br/> Altho' she was Naturaly of a
         						very still disposition, yet Concerning <br/> her own heart, and y<sup>e</sup> Acquaintens with our Saviour She Cou'd say
         						enouf: <br/> for, as soon as any one, begun in this subject, She never was Silent <br/> but was always ready to relate, our Saviours works of Gracein her heart<br/> Which from time to time, through his most Nearness, was carried on in her <br/> further then any Human Eye could penatrate, and past (unclear) <br/> so that when She
         						in a Childlike manner spoke something thereof it made <br/> her fellow Sisters mealt in (unclear) Shame, </p>

      <p> When y<sup>e</sup> Hundred, was Setled here, She was one which was recived into <br/> that Number </p>
      <p> I y<sup>e</sup> Year <em>1753</em> She removed in to y<sup>e</sup> Choir-house with y<sup>e</sup>
         						rest <br/> of y<sup>e</sup> Sisters, at which She rejoiced, very much, for y<sup>e</sup> Liveing in
         						a <br/> Choir-house, was to her every waty matter, for her Choir was very dear<br/> to her, and one can with trueth, Give her y<sup>e</sup> testimony, that She was <br/> a true Virgin, who went on in an uninterrupted Convers with y<sup>e</sup><br/> Man of Smart, being tenderlyattached to his Marterd figur, </p>
      <p> She enjoid, in her Choir, all Choir Graces, And when y<sup>e</sup><br/> Dear <a href="#mlper000699.html">Mother</a>, and <a href="#mlper000566.html">Dicipl</a> was here, at that
         						Never to be forgotten <br/>blessed Choier, Lord-supper; She was also one of that Number <br/> for this Long time past, She has talkd
         						very much of going home <br/> And said She, <sup>I can't</sup> not help beliveing that <sup>my</sup> time would not <br/> be long in this World,
         						on her last birth-day She got a particular <br/> intimation from our Saviour, Consorneing thiss, since which <br/> time, She has often
         						told y<sup>e</sup> Sister you will <sup>see</sup>, I shall go home before <br/> my next birth-day, for I have beg'd our Saviour to take me <br/> home thiss year and I also belive he surely will, She has for <br/> some time past, Complaind very much of a pain in her head <br/> which never Left her, but continued to grow worse, and tis <br/> Strenthend her

      <p> On <em>July y<sup>e</sup> 22<sup>d</sup></em> She enterd y<sup>e</sup> Sick room, when y<sup>e</sup>disorder in <br/> her head, began to grow very Voilen, </p>
      <p> ye 25<sup>th</sup> She began to Sing, have no mind for Eating or for drinking <br/> Food, which must Corrupt again &amp;c <br/> And many such like Versses,
         						which showd planly the Longingof her <br/> heart to be at home; altho her pains which she felt, was very great <br/> yet when She recoverd,
         						her Self a little, She was so brisk and Chearfull<br/> and would talk with y<sup>e</sup> Sisters in Such on agreable manner, that <br/> it was a pleasuer, to be with her <sup>her</sup> disorder lying so much in her <br/> head, we thought it proper to keep her still as possable, it was there
         						for <br/>desired that y<sup>e</sup> Sister would go but of Little in to y<sup>e</sup><br/> Sick-room, which when She percived, made her very much </p>
      <p>dissatisfied, and She desired that y<sup>e</sup> Sisters might not <br/> be kept
         						from comeing to see her, becose it made the time much <br/> pleasent'er to her when y<sup>e</sup> Sisters was with
         						her. </p>
      <p> She desired that She might once <sup>more</sup> be brought into her Liveing <br/> Room, which was done, this pleasd her very much, She desired we would <br/> Sing her some Verses, for going home, which was done under such a
         						<br/> sencable felling, of y<sup>e</sup> Nearness of our Saviour, and with an inward <br/>loningof our hearts, to be at home with him; which made our Eyes over flow <br/> with tears, we
         						could scarcely perswade her to let us take her in to <br/> ye Sick-room again, but being affraid She would spend her self to <br/> and we
         							beg'<sup>d</sup> her Now to take her Leave, then She desired us to <br/> concluded, with that Vers, Love, who death for me endured, &amp;c. </p>
      <p> in a few days after, She desired to see her Class, once more together <br/> When y<sup>e</sup> Sisters had made y<sup>e</sup>Love-feast ready they brought her <br/> into y<sup>e</sup> Room, at which She was so lively
         						and Chearfull, that She <br/> did not seem like a Sick-person; so that we Could have almost <br/> belive, She might rely recover again; we
         						put it to her, if She Still <br/> realy thought of Leveing us; She said, She could not tell, but her <br/> Choice, wou'd be to go home, but when I consider it rightly, what
         						<br/> A time that will be, when I come to our Saviour, the favour seems <br/> to great; we then Askd her, if She did go home whome She
         						would <br/> fetch y<sup>e</sup> first She then Namd a Sister, we then Ask'd why her in <br/> perticuler? She <sup>said</sup> becose I belive

         						<br/> you that when I come to our Saviour, I will not forget one in this house, <br/> this She took leve of her Class, and went again in
         						to y<sup>e</sup> Sick-room <br/> She continued for some time, better then ever we had seen, her since <br/> in y<sup>e</sup> Sick-room, so
         						that She her Self, began to believe, She might <br/> mend again, but in a short time, her pain returnd rather worse <br/> then ever, </p>
