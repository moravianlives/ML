					<lb />Ann Willoughby, Was born at Robert Town,
					<lb />In the Parish of Birstal Janry ye 21st 1722
					<lb />about the year 1739 She was Stir&apos;d up by reading
					<lb />a Penny Pamphlet, and from that time Grew so
					<lb />Uneasy, Concerning her Salvation, that it greatly
					<lb />Affected her Body, Which her Mother, &amp; others
					<lb />of her Relations Observing; insisted upon her
					<lb />taking the Advice of a Physician: This she
					<lb />out of Obedience Comply&apos;d with being notwith-
					<lb />standing convinc&apos;d that as her Disease was of a
					<lb />Spiritual nature; it could not be Remov&apos;d by
					<lb />human means, She attended on Mr. Ingham&apos;s
					<lb />Preaching, from his first begining and after-
					<lb />wards adher&apos;d for the Brn as Soon as They Came
					<lb />to Yorkshire; and Visited &amp; Convers&apos;d With those
					<lb />of them who Resided at New house, about ye year
					<lb />1742. Br &amp; Sr Ockershousen being then settled
					<lb />at Mirfield. She having now receiv&apos;d Grace
					<lb />and Chearfulness from our Saviour, and being in 
					<lb />Consequence thereof restor&apos;d to her Bodily Health;
					<lb />She was also of a Remarkable good Understanding 
					<lb />and Ready of Apprehension Whereby She was 
					<lb />Employ&apos;d in Visiting the Single Women in that
					<lb />Plan, on ye 5th Janry 1744 She Was Receiv&apos;d
					<lb />into the Congregation &amp; Was admitted to the 
					<lb />Sacrament ye 31st of July in ye same Year, about
					<lb />this time it was intended that She Should Change
					<lb />Her State But When it was Propos&apos;d to her, she
					<lb />made some Objection; So the matter was Intirely
					<lb />dropt by the Labourers, &amp; they were also Satisfied
					<lb />With her; X But she however could not give it
					<lb />up herself, and When the thing was now over, She
					<lb />Declar&apos;d herself in a different manner than she
					<lb />had done before, after this she went on heavily for
					<lb />a Considerable time, But at length she gave it up, and

			<p>
				
					<lb />and was better Satisfied + she had an extraordinary
					<lb />gift for Oconomical affairs, and Was very diligent
					<lb />and exact in ye like Undertakings, of which many
					<lb />were Commited to her Care, her Labours were not
					<lb />without Blessing X But yet (from what cause we
					<lb />Will not Possibly determine) they were frequently
					<lb />Intermingled with Disappointments and disagreeable
					<lb />circumstances to the disatisfaction of others, but
					<lb />particularly to the grief of her own heart and to 
					<lb />the detriment of her Bodily health X Yet She was
					<lb />By many heartily Beloved and generally acknow-
					<lb />ledged as an Honest Heart, In ye begining of June
					<lb />1746 she came to live at the Single Srs
					<lb />Oconomie at Pudsey; she was one of the Hourly 
					<lb />Intercessers and also visiter in the Plans, in this 
					<lb />year was also for a short time at Oxheys and 
					<lb />Holm, and had the Care of Each of those Oconomies
					<lb />And May 1747 She made also the begining of that 
					<lb />at Clegheaton, as well as the first School of the 
					<lb />girls, Which she kept at the Same Place</p>
					<p>
					<lb />From thence She went to Tyrsal in Augt 1750 and 
					<lb />Began an Oconomie there where she continued 
					<lb />till December 1752 when She with the Said
					<lb />Oconomie Came to Live In the Choir House of 
					<lb />the Single Sisters, Where she Perform&apos;d the 
					<lb />Office which she had there of Accountant and
					<lb />Inspecter of outward affairs as also of vorgasety
					<lb />of a Room with that Punctuality and exactness
					<lb />So Peculiar to her and to the Satisfaction of the 
					<lb />Whole House, and this She carried on even in 
					<lb />her Sickness, Which Begun In the month of Novbr
					<lb />1754 When She first complain&apos;d Whereby We
					<lb />Plainly Perceiv&apos;d that She fell away, and was
					<lb />troubled with a Certain Cough, Which We thought 
					<lb />Would turn out to be a Consumption; and the 
				
			</p>
					<cb />
			<p>
				
					<lb />12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of February She Retir&apos;d to the Sick Room
					<lb />Where by many Persuasions We got her to Use Some
					<lb />thing from the Doctor in hopes that She might
					<lb />soon be better, all things possible was done for her
					<lb />In Regard to her health But she often Believ&apos;d that 
					<lb />The Physicians did not Rightly understand her
					<lb />Disorder &amp; therefore Resolv&apos;d to Leave of taking
					<lb />Medcines &amp; to Give herself over into the Hands of
					<lb />our Saviour, But as her Sickness Seem&apos;d to be of 
					<lb />a lingering disorder she had some small hopes of
					<lb />Recovering again, During her Sickness the Congren
					<lb />Partook 4 times of the Holy Sacrament, and the
					<lb />third time which was the 20th of April Our Dear 
					<lb />Johannes brought it to her; Which Was attended
					<lb />With a very Particular Sweet feeling, He sung
					<lb />her that verse, the Soul of Christ her Sanity &amp;c
					<lb />After Which she laid herself happily Down to rest
					<lb />The 23d She Long&apos;d very much to speak With Sister
					<lb />Mary; Where she told she Plainly Perceiv&apos;d She 
					<lb />grew Weaker and Beliv&apos;d She Should go to our
					<lb />Saviour, and Because She felt herself not capable
					<lb />of Performing her Office of Writing &amp; Reckoning 
					<lb />as She Us&apos;d to do, Therefore her desire was to
					<lb />Give it over, That she Might Spend those Days
					<lb />Which she had yet to Live, In Pleasure &amp; Satis-
					<lb />faction; and in the Closest Nearness of her Bride-
					<lb />groom &amp; Lover, Without the care of outward
					<lb />Matters, Which was approv&apos;d on, then she said,
					<lb />This Was a Point Which I have long&apos;d for to be 
					<lb />Settled While I had Strength to Speak, Now the 
					<lb />Second is, Concerning My own Heart, Which will
					<lb />take Up a Considerable Time, But I Would
					<lb />desire you to hear me Patiently &amp; not be grievd
					<lb />after I have told you all, and then I only beg you
					<lb />To forgive <del>you</del> me &amp; Love me Still, Some of them
					<lb />are oft matters, Which I know our Saviour has forgiven

					<lb />me for, But I thought I could be more fully, satisfied 
					<lb />If I accquainted you With them; and how those matters
					<lb />stood, So I have Wish&apos;d very much to have a hearty
					<lb />Conversation With you, Which accordinly Was done
					<lb />Between them With many Tears, Then She declar&apos;d
					<lb />Her Heart was quite Satisfied, and now she had but
					<lb />one thing more to mention, Which Was concerning 
					<lb />Her Burial, What thoughts She had about it, and
					<lb />made some Proposals, Which was Agree&apos;d to 
					<lb />May ye 14th She Spoke With Concern, that to Day it
					<lb />was 15 Weeks since she came in the Sick Room
					<lb />and She thought the time very long before our Savr
					<lb />fetch&apos;d her to himself, the 18th She had that
					<lb />Favour to Partake once more of our Dear Savrs
					<lb />Body &amp; Blood in the Holy Communion of Which 
					<lb />Her Poor Hungry &amp; Thirsty Soul was very glad
					<lb />She also continued quite happy &amp; Chearful, &amp; the
					<lb />21st We Observ&apos;d a Particular Alteration In her 
					<lb />Which We Perceiv&apos;d to be Convulsions, so that we
					<lb />Believ&apos;d she would soon go home, But She grow-
					<lb />ing a little Better continued ye 22d all Day in a
					<lb />Cold Death Sweat Tho&apos; Exceeding Ill, yet She spoke
					<lb />often about her own Heart &amp; others, to our great
					<lb />Surprise, &amp; upon being Ask&apos;d if She would kiss
					<lb />our Saviours Feet for us, She answer&apos;d; not only
					<lb />That, but I will tell Him Ev&apos;ry thing let me but
					<lb />first come to him, ye 23d Stronger convulsions
					<lb />and that with more continuance Which Seiz&apos;d on
					<lb />her Memory very much, so that We thought Ev&apos;ry
					<lb />Breath She Drew would be the last, But yet
					<lb />We could Perceive that she often spoke in Stillness
					<lb />Whereupon we ask&apos;d her Who she spoke with, she
					<lb />Immediately Replied With our Saviour, that He 
					<lb />May manifest himself to me till the last moment
					<lb />as he always has hitherto Done ever Since I Was first
					<lb />acquainted with him &amp; his Wounds at 1 o Clock
					<lb />In the afternoon, She desird to have a couple of hours
					<lb />To herself alone, with our Saviour, and at 3 for
				
			</p>
					<cb />
			<p>
				
					<lb />With a Smiling Countenance, her Soul flew into the 
					<lb />Pleura of her Everlasting Bridegroom &amp; Lover
					<lb />Under those words, His Body Torn With many a 
					<lb />Wound, That makes thy Soul &amp; Body Sound;
					<lb />and, so go then go Dear Heart &amp; hide &amp;c.</p>
					<p>
					<lb />After having liv&apos;d 33 years 4 months 
					<lb />And two Days
