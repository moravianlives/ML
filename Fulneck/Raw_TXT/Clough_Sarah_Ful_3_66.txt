The Course of Life of the Single Sistr Sarh Clough
Concerning which she has left the following,
I was born augst 15 in the year 1744, in the Parish of Burstel, in Yorkshire
and Baptiz'd in the Church of England, My Parrents being
in Conviction with the Brotheren in my Infancy I in Consequence 
have been under their care from a Child, I frequented the
Meetings kept for the Children with great pleasurs, Till I grow
up to be a great girl, When my Natural Depravity began to
Show itself, I got a Desire for the pleasures of this World,
in Which I cou'd not gratify my self by reason that my Parrents
Belong'd to the Brethron, Which I heartily wishd had not
been the Case, But Our Savr soon Overcame my heart again, by
means of a Meeting Which Br Occertshousn hold one Sunday, in 
Gumersal Chappel, Wherein I was fully Convincd of my wrong way
of thinking, and cou'd never rest till I came into a nearer Conection
by Reception into the Society, In 1762 on the 19 of September
I Obtaind leave to live in the Sistrs Oeconomy at Gumersall
Which rejoic'd me verry much, and the 4 of May, following
was re'd into the Single Sistrs Choir, to a real Blessing for my Heart
Augst 13 1763 I had the Grace to be rec'd into the Congregation
Which was quite a peculiar grace and Blessing to me, Tho' I
Soon came from affect, and came into a more dry and indifferent way
in my self, in 1765 Febry ye 22 I remov'd from Gumersall,
into the Choir House at Fullneck, Where I spent several years Some time
without much Concern about my self or any thing, Till our Savr
thro' His Holy Spirit brought me to Recolection over my Course
in General, I grow upon this very Miserable, and thought Our
Savr cou'd never forgive me, for so Mispending my time, being of
a Close dispostion, it was some time before I cou'd speak this
My concern, but frequently intreated Our Savr to help me,
Which he accordingly did, So that I cou'd speak of my Distress
quits Openheartedly with the Choir helper, as also my thoughts
Concerning the H Communion, She Comforted me about every thing,


asuring me that I shoud be thought on, June ye 20 1767
I had the grace to be Spectator at the H Comn to my unspeakable
abasement, My Choir Helper encouraged me to belove that
Our Savr wou'd bestow this Grace upon me in his own good time
and on the 7 of Novbr ye same year I became a participant
of the Lords Body and Blood Sacramentaly to an inexpressible
and abiding Blessing to my poor heart, Which has in a lively
Manner been renew'd to me every time I have had the favour to
partake with the Congn of that Highest Good, Thus far our Late Sistr
Our happily departed Sistr was naturaly of a still dejected turn
on which account it was often needfull to comfort & encourage her
yet it was discernible in her that her heart was closly atachd to
Our Savr as a poor Sinner who had no other dependance then
his allsufficient Merits, her still and inofensive Course, gaind
the love and esteem of all who were aqainted with her,
her Dissolution Comenced I by means of a lingoring Consumption
hinder which she has labour'd 4 years, during which time She
Show' d great patience, & Resignation to Our Savrs will,
Concerning her She spent near 5 months in the sick room in a
tender longing soon to be at home with her Redeemer, whose
Comforting Nearness was her support, under her long and painfull
illness, which towards the Later part was very acute,
She Longd ardently for the injoymnt of the Holy Comunion
which was She injoyd for the Last time Octer ye 31 to her
great Refreshment, & Consolation, She often expresd her
Longing to be with our Savr by calling on him in the most tender  
to come and take her to himself, Which he accordingly did
Novr ye 3 between 10 and 11 oClock in the forenoon During a sweet
feeling of the Peace of God, and the Blessing of her Choir in
the 29 year of her Age. The watchword for the Day


The bruised Reed Shall he not break, and the 
Smoking flare Shall he not quench
