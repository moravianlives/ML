Hannah  Illingworth Course of life
our dear Sister Hannah Illingworth was born at whibsey
october 27th 1721. her maiden Name was Overend, She was
Married with the present Widower Joshua Illingworth at Bradford
In March 1749 She had in her Marriage 1 Son & 2 daughters
The Son about 8 Year old she left behind, the 2 daughters went
before her to our gracious Savr as Infants, She was brought up
a presbyterien & became Concern'd about her Salvation soon
after her Marriage. In the Year 1752 her Heart was laid pertic
hold of by our Saviours Grace thro' Br Cenicks preaching
here, in Yorkshire since that Time She adhered to the
Brethren & was according to her Earnest desire Received
in to the Brns Society at Horton, in the Year 1755, which
proved a great Blessing to her heart, our dear Savr brought
her more & more upon her heart & shewed her, her
deep corruption & depravity, on which account she
was deeply Concern'd & Spoke often with many Tears
to her Labourers about it, She met with hard Trials in
her Familie which She bore with uncommon
patience & Resingnation to our dear Savr
on January the 1. 1761 her longing wishd for desire
was granted her, & she was Received in to the Congrn
for which Grace her Heart was truly thankfull
She was of late Years often troubled with a Lameness
in her Limbs which prevented her from in EnJoying
the Congrn meetings, Sister Hauptmann who of late
has often I spoke with her, about her Heart, found her
as a poor Sinner Closeley attached to our dear Savrs wounded
person, a few weeks before her departure she told her, that
She felt & believed that she would not be long here but should
go to our dear Savr, & kept an openhearted Band with her,


Concerning her whole Course, to all appearance she did
not seem such a near Candidate for entrring in to Healths
happy bounds, for she looked very well, at christmass Eve
she felt her time approaching, & beg'd of her Husband if she
should go home that he would let her be Burried at Fullneck
which to him seemed far of, & he would not promiss her
at that Time, he agreed however afterwards to her Request
upon her repeating it, the day after she got a high fever which
had such an effect on her Head, that she forgot every thing
and did not even know her Husband & child, & what yet more
was quite Surprizing to all her Soul lived & was Sensible
of the Redemption in His precious Blood of that she
would Sing of her self in the most beautiful Connection
& would Join with others & if Some time a word would fail
her, she would stop & say, how is that, & as soon as it was
told her, she sung on in a Sweet Harmony, her Favourd
verses were Thy Blood sweat dear save rain on me like
water, &c I am poor but Blood has warmed my poor
heart & I am charmed, struck and overcome for ever with
the wounds of my dear Savr and thus she Continued
till January 23. In the morning when she had lain
still for to good while she fell Softley asleep in
Jesus arms In the 43th Year of her dying life, her
Corpse & Look Serene and fair, witnessed that she
was a believer. She was much beloved & 
Respected by all her nighbours who Lamented the Loss
of her, our dear Lords loving kindness was pertic
Manifest, that He took her to him self, for she was
in dangerous & Critical Circumstances
