					B<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> James Cromark born at <lb />
					<gap reason="illegible"/> in Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1767 &amp; baptised in the <lb />
					Ch of Engld, but his father joining <lb />
					the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> soon afterwards he bro<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> his chil- <lb />
					dren regularly with him to our chapel <lb />
					<gap reason="illegible"/> also that <gap reason="illegible"/> (he knew the truth) from <lb />
					our souls childhood, &amp; was made ac- <lb />
					quainted with the people among whom <lb />
					he subsequently cast in his lot. When <lb />
					12 or 13 yrs. of age he was put appren- <lb />
					tice to clothier of the name of Mir- <lb />
					field of <unclear>Green??</unclear> Pudsey whose wife <lb />
					was also a member of our choir <lb />
					so that he had still attended the <lb />
					means of Grace here. Some yrs <lb />
					after his apprenticeship termina- <lb />
					ted he marr<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> his present widow &amp; in <lb />
					1798 they were both added to our <lb />
					Society &amp; afterwards rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> into the <lb />
					Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; admitted to the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> <lb />
					together, &amp; have ever since remain- <lb />
					ed attached &amp; faithful members. <lb />
					The good deed of the word was early <lb />
					sown in our late B<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> heart so that his <lb />
					understanding was enlightened, his <lb />
					conscience made tender &amp; his heart in <lb />
					clined to fear Gods, &amp; hence his con- <lb />
					duct was never, even in his youth <lb />
					loose or immoral; on the other hand <lb />
					he always shunned evil company <lb />
					&amp; maintained a good character. It was <lb />
					however under the ministry of the late

					B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John <unclear>Hartley</unclear> that both he &amp; his <gap reason="illegible"/> <lb />
					ner were incited to devote themselves <lb />
					unreservedly to their Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; to seek <lb />
					fellowship with a Xtian Church &amp; <lb />
					they joined <add place="above">our</add> <del>the</del> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> because they <lb />
					felt themselves divinely called to <lb />
					it. During the 46 yrs. that our <lb />
					late B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> has gone in &amp; out among <lb />
					us, we saw in him the testimony <lb />
					that he walked humbly with his God <lb />
					that his faith was simple &amp; childlike <lb />
					&amp; no doubt his heart was purified <lb />
					by means of that faith for it wrought <lb />
					by love - the love of God shed abroad in <lb />
					his heart by the H. Ghost,  for &amp; he evi- <lb />
					dently loved both the Lord, &amp; his people. <lb />
					He made no ostentatious display of <lb />
					his piety, was a quiet, retiring <lb />
					unobtrusive character &amp; a man of <lb />
					few words; but that he had experien- <lb />
					ced grace &amp; lived in communion with <lb />
					the Friend of his soul was manifest <lb />
					from his whole conduct &amp; spirit; <lb />
					when he <hi rend="underline">did</hi> speak on spiritual <lb />
					matters, his words tho&apos; few, were to the <lb />
					point &amp; particularly during his <lb />
					last illness, when the love of Christ a crucified Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
					displayed to &amp; in <hi rend="underline">him</hi>, a poor sinner <lb />
					was the subject. his eyes might be <lb />
					seen suffused with tears. His charac-

					ter was such, that he was beloved by <lb />
					his family (&amp; especially his children, <lb />
					whom he &amp; his partner strove to bring <lb />
					up in the nurture &amp; admonition of <lb />
					the Lord, &amp; that Lord blessed their <gap reason="illegible"/> <lb />
					tions &amp; heard their prayers) &amp; respec- <lb />
					ted by all that knew him.</p>
					<p>
					4 or 5 months ago he fell ill of the <lb />
					jaundice, &amp; tho&apos; he seemed to get over <lb />
					<hi rend="underline">that</hi> disease, dropsical symptoms <lb />
					appeared in his legs, which after re <lb />
					maining stationary for some time, <lb />
					began to spread rapidly about a fort- <lb />
					night ago, &amp; compelled him to take <lb />
					almost entirely to his bed. He seems <lb />
					to have apprehended his approaching <lb />
					dissolution from the first, but was <lb />
					perfectly resigned to his divine Master&apos;s <lb />
					will. he was always found cheerful <lb />
					when visited, humbly yet confident- <lb />
					ly trusting in our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; only desi- <lb />
					rous to be made ready for his <lb />
					coming. Last week he felt some- <lb />
					what gloomy &amp; doubts &amp; fears some rather <lb />
					what harassed him, probably no doubt in con- <lb />
					sequence of bodily pain &amp; increasing <lb />
					debility; yet in the under of all he <lb />
					told his wife he knew it was but a <lb />
					transient season of distress &amp; for that <lb />
					his Redeemer would comfort &amp; assure <lb />
					him again. Last Friday I called

					upon him &amp; administered to him the <lb />
					consolations, which are calculated so abundantly to <lb />
					cheer &amp; strengthen a child of God, when <lb />
					walking thro&apos; the valley of the shadow of <lb />
					 death, reminding him of the many sweet <lb />
					&amp; precious promises given to the afflicted <lb />
					believer &amp; above all, of the <hi rend="underline">all suffering</hi> <lb />
					of Him, in whom he had believed the <hi rend="underline">all</hi> <lb />
					<hi rend="underline">ataining</hi> virtue of His blood the perfectness <lb />
					of his righteousness, of his being so ten- <lb />
					derly compassionate a high-priest,  <lb />
					of His being Jesus Christ same yesterday  <lb />
					to-day &amp; for ever. These precious truths <lb />
					&amp; promises served to revive his spirit <lb />
					&amp; I then commended him in fervant <lb />
					prayer to the mercies of his God &amp; Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. <lb />
					He assured me, before I left him, that he <lb />
					felt much comforted, the tears meantime <lb />
					trickling down his cheeks. Indeed, he re- <lb />
					mained cheerful to the end, &amp; told his <lb />
					partners, not long before he died, that he <lb />
					was perfectly tranquil &amp; happy in his <lb />
					mind, full of confidence in the Sav<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> <lb />
					&amp; longing to depart &amp; to be with Xt! <lb />
					He fell asleep in Jesus without a <lb />
					struggle or a groan, on Tuesday morn  <lb />
					last ab<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> 5 a.m., aged 77 years. <lb />
					He had 10 child<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, 5 of whom have pre- <lb />
					ceded him into eternity, &amp; 25 grand- <lb />
					children, most of whom are still living <lb />
					&amp; many of them scholars in our Sun- <lb />
					day School. May the Lord give them all <lb />
					grace to follow in their father&apos;s or grandfa- <lb />
					ther, as far as he followed Xt. &amp; visbly <lb />
					comfort &amp; graciously guide &amp; sustain our <lb />
					d<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Sister, his aged &amp; afflicted widow!
