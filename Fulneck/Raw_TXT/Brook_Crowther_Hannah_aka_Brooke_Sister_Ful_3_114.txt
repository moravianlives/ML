The following was dictated
by Sr Brooke March 16th 1856.
I was born in Pudsey Oct 29th
1784 where my father carried on
the business of a Clothier, and as
my natural from of mind was
not so cheerful as that of my Sister
I was kept at home to be useful to
my parents, thus missing the ad
vantages of Education I might have
otherwise enjoyed. When 13 years
old I was placed at the request
of my Father in the Srs House


at Wyke, and for this I shall even
in Eternity have to feel grateful,
as here I learned to know Christ
as my Saviour, and had from
time to time sweet enjoyment
of his love. For a short time I
lived in Gummersal Srs House,
and here it was I entered into the
the married state with my surviving
partner, who then had the care 
the Shop in Mirfield. Here my first
heavy trial came on, by the loss of
my dear and only child, a trial
no doubt permitted in Mercy to
me, but especially to the dear boy


she was thus early translated into
the arms of him who has said
Suffer the little children to come
unto me and forbid them not, for
of such is the kingdom of Heaven.
Here I must acknowlege with pain
this bereavment often caused me
 to murmer, and it was long e'er
I could say "Thy will be done."
After living a short time in F Field
where my Husband was Warden, we
removed to Fulneck to have the care
of the Congr Shop and the my Husband
was here also Warden. In this


hope she too will make her
calling and election sure. I
name this concerning my ser
vant, to encourage those who
have to nurse sick persons, not
to be afraid to speak to them
faithfully, and cheerfully of
the state of their minds and
thereby help them greatly in
the best way possible.


To this short account dictated
by our late Sr we can only add
a few remarks discriptive of the
reach of grace and the mercy
displayed to her at the close
of her life under heavy
affliction.
During a severe illness she
had more than a year ago
When her strength
was completely prostrated, and
her end appeared very near, she
experienced much support and
enjoyed strong inward consola
tions from our Saviour.
At this time her conversa
tions were edifying, and it was
evident, she was enjoying much
peace.
Subsequently however when
strength partially returned she
seemed to lose her hold on cheerfulness
our Saviour and the cares and
ansieties about worldly concerns
and especially for her aged and
infirm partner took too much
hold upon her and her heavy


afflication weighed down her
spirit and so that she indulged in
murmurings and repinings.
This brought a cloud over
her mind, darkness seemed to
hide Jesus from her view and
she could not joy in her salva
tion.
It was a season of deep searching
of heart, and led ended through the
grace of God in much humility
and confession of sin.
From this season of gloom
she was graciously delivered and
in the beginning of last month
her heart could again rejoice
and speak the language Of
joyful hope. 
It was delightful to
witness, the calm composure
and the quiet resignation
that she now enjoyed often
regretting that she had given
way to a fretful and refraining
spirit.


She now often spoke of her
departure and mentioned
the text from which the funeral
discourse should be delivered
saying that she had often wished
to hear it discoursed upon,
and intended if she had again
come to Chapel to ask it to be
chosen.
On this occasion 2 portions
of Scripture afforded her comfort: 
Our light affliction &c., she
she spoke of her affliction as light
compared with the heavenly
glory joy, the weight of glory that
was laid up for her. 
How lived the thought, she said
how precious to be there released
from all the burdens of the flesh
for there the inhabitants shall
no more say I am sick.
Come meet me all ye that
are weary and heavy laden
and I will give you rest. 
These words she repeated with
much emotion and said


that her mind had dwelt
much on these of late and
that her sister had derived much
comfort from them the week
before her death
Such was her extreme weakness
at this time that the dreaded
the thoughts of going up stairs
to bed as for several nights 
past the effect has exhausted
her very much, but with a 
smile she said this I believe
will be the last time I shall
not come down again. 
On one occasion she said
very confidently You will soon
have to bury me. You will have
little to say of me, only that
as a poor sinful creature, I have
gone to heaven, saved by grace.
At a subsequent visit when
very weak she said He is near
very near. Happy he will no
leave me, I know he will not. 
I can trust him.
On the 5th she was in a very


pleasing state of mind and
said, there is a house for me
in heaven. I believe I shall
soon go. He will receive me as
a pardoned sinner. This is all
my desire. Shall then be washed
in his blood.
And on Saturday the 12 "I enjoy
peace. All is clear. My Saviour is
near. He is a merciful God. 
Oh how I long to go and see - The 
Lamb of God as he died for me,
How do I languish night and day
I hear him bid me come away.
When I am gone you may
sing the verse over me - Happy soul
My days are ended, All thy
mourning day belove."
The peace of God was at this time
very sensibly felt by all present,
and her heart seemed to over
flow with thankfulness and
the desire that all might share
in her happiness.
