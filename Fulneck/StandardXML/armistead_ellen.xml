            <p>
            <lb/>Ellen Armistead died Sep. / 46
            <lb/>Our late S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> was born at the farm
            <lb/>house n<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> the bottom of Tory-lane
            <lb/>Oct<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 29<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1789. Her parents bro<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi> her &amp; 
            <lb/>all their children with them to our
            <lb/>chapel, which they constantly attended.
            <lb/>They afterwards joined our church,
            <lb/>are both buried interred in our burying ground.
            <lb/>In her 13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> year she went to reside
            <lb/>in the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs'</hi> house at Wyke, &amp; continued 
            <lb/>there till that institution was
            <lb/>broken up in 1805; she then came
            <lb/>to Fulneck, &amp; resided in the S. S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs.</hi>
            <lb/>house, where she was employed a
            <lb/>short time in the wash, &amp; then near
            <lb/>ly 4 yrs. as cook. She then lived for
            <lb/>10 years with her mother at West
            <lb/>gate-hill. Both of them came to
            <lb/>Fulneck every Sunday, &amp; on all fes
            <lb/>tive occassions when it was practi
            <lb/>cable. In the y<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 1825, they both came
            <lb/>to this place &amp; took 2 rooms
            <lb/>to reside in our S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs'</hi> house here.
            <lb/>following
            <lb/>Next y<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> our late S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> went to live
            <lb/>with B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi> Holmes; &amp; was after
            <lb/>wards twice housekeeper &amp; cook in
            <lb/>the S. B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rns'</hi> house. She then retired
            <lb/>into the Sisters' house, &amp; lived there
            <lb/>until Dec<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi> 1843, when she married 
            <lb/>her her relict B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi> Will<hi rend="superscript:true;">m</hi> Armistead.
            <lb/>She had the happiness to know the
            <lb/>truth from her childhood &amp; <hi rend="underlined:true;">that</hi>
            <lb/>we have every reason to believe, not
            </p>
            <pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_122_Armisted_Ellen-03.jpg" n="2"/>
            <p>
            <lb/>only <hi rend="underlined:true;">theoretically</hi>, but so, that her
            <lb/>heart was lovingly influenced thereby,
            <lb/>so that she devoted herself to the Lord, &amp; 
            <lb/>lived in communion with Him. She was 
            <lb/>rec<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> into the church in 1805 &amp; addmit
            <lb/>ted to the H. Com<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> in 1808. Like all 
            <lb/>for who does not
            <lb/>of us who feel the effects of our natural 
            <lb/>corruption, more less to our his dying day
            <lb/>the flesh beating against the spirit
            <lb/>the spirit against the flesh. she had 
            <lb/>her failings as well as her sharp con
            <lb/>flicts &amp; heavy trials; yet, generally 
            <lb/>speaking, her spirit &amp; conduct were
            <lb/>consistent with her profession; &amp; occa
            <lb/>sional spiritual conversation with
            <lb/>her showed that she knew herself to
            <lb/>be a poor sinner, but that she belie
            <lb/>ved in him as her all-sufficient
            <lb/>Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi>, loved him &amp; clave to him
            <lb/>A few days before her last illness
            <lb/>commenced, we called upon her &amp; her
            <lb/>husband, &amp; had a conversation, chiefly
            <lb/>of a spiritual character, with them, 
            <lb/>when we were struck with her being
            <lb/>unusually &amp; pleasingly fluent &amp;
            <lb/>communicative on the concerns of
            <lb/>her soul. She appears to have taken
            <lb/>cold on Sept<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 7<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi>; but the com 
            <lb/>plaint soon developed itself as
            <lb/>the English cholera. As, however, 
            <lb/>she did not suppose it was anything
            <lb/>serious, she continued her usual oc
            <lb/>cupations for a fortnight, tho' very
            <lb/>weak &amp; poorly. At length she was ne

            <p>
            <lb/>cessitated to call in medical ad
            <lb/>vice; but, in spite of all the
            <lb/>mesures used, she grew worse, &amp;, on
            <lb/>Tuesday morning last between 5 &amp; 6,
            <lb/>she fell into a sleep which, for several
            <lb/>hours, was tho<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi> to be a natural &amp; 
            <lb/>refreshing slumber; at length, however,
            <lb/>it appeared to be a stupor from which
            <lb/>she would never awake; she was then
            <lb/>fore recd the usual blessing for her
            <lb/>departure between 7 &amp; 8 a.m. on Wed
            <lb/>nesday mor &amp; ab<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi>. 11 o'clock breathed
            <lb/>her last. of course in a state of
            <lb/>unconsciousness.
            <lb/>She had, on several occasions, previous
            <lb/>to her sinking into this lethargy
            <lb/>state, spoken very satisfactorily of
            <lb/>her spiritual state, &amp; of her hope &amp;
            <lb/>confidence in her Redeemer. She
            <lb/>declared her consciousness of her
            <lb/>own sinfulness &amp; rotten demerit
            <lb/>saying, on one occasion, "When I look
            <lb/>at myself I see nothing but only sin &amp;
            <lb/>misery; &amp; nothing but turning to
            <lb/>my Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> can comfort &amp; cheer me."
            <lb/>But she clave to Jesus with purpose
            <lb/>of heart, saying "Poor sinner as I am,
            <lb/>I know whom I have believed; I feel
            <lb/>our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> mercy &amp; peace; for He is
            <lb/>with, He is near me." &amp; being 
            <lb/>asked if she had a good hope, that
            <lb/>He would receive her she replied; "I
            <lb/>have not the least doubt, that He
            <lb/>will do so, for His mercy &amp; merits."
            </p>

            <p>
            <lb/>We cannot have, therefore, a confident
            <lb/>hope that she has entered into that
            <lb/>rest, which remaineth for the people
            <lb/>of God.
            <lb/>Her character was such, that she
            <lb/>was generally respected while living
            <lb/>&amp; is as generally regretted when dead.
            <lb/>Her own relations loved her &amp; her
            <lb/>husband's children &amp; grandchildren,
            <lb/>one of whom was the last
            <lb/>person conveyed to our burying-ground
            <lb/>never felt no little affection for
            <lb/>her. Her relict declares no more could
            <lb/>have a more affectionate &amp; valuable
            <lb/>helpmate than he has lost in her. He
            <lb/>speaks particularly of her spirituality
            <lb/>of mind; as one proof of which he has
            <lb/>told the writer, that she used to take
            <lb/>great delight in the family devotion
            <lb/>which they held together, in the mid
            <lb/>night hour each day, so that (she
            <lb/>would cheerfully rise from her bed to join him
            <lb/>in it) even tho' she had retired, con
            <lb/>trary to her usual practice, while
            <lb/>he went his rounds as watchman
            <lb/>her afflicted husband's 
            <lb/>May the Lord her her support &amp;
            <lb/>under his bereavement
            <lb/>comfort &amp; give him &amp; all her rela
            <lb/>tives grace to make their calling &amp;
            <lb/>election sure! Yea, may we all
            <lb/>meet her &amp; others who have gone be
            <lb/>fore us, in the city of the living God, 
            <lb/>&amp; before the throne of the Lamb!
            <lb/>Her age was 57 years within 28
            <lb/>days.
