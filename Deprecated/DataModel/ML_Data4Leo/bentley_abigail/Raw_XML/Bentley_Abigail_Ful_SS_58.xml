					<l>The course of Life of Abigal Bently </l>
					<l>I was born at Wike in the Parish of Barstel April ye 23d 1722</l>
					<l>my Parrents was of the Church of England and brought me up in the </l>
					<l>same, as far as I can remember my first thought of being saved was thro&apos;</l>
					<l>hereing my Mother speak with another what time Children begun to be anser</l>
					<l>able for Sin and they thought at Seven-years, this had such an impression</l>
					<l>on my mind that I often went alone and wish&apos;d God wou&apos;d let me die before that</l>
					<l>time for then I took it for granted I should be saved, when I was about Seven</l>
					<l>Years I began to be afraid of dying, my Parrents strove to preserve me as far</l>
					<l>as there circumstances permitted them, in my Eleventh year I was sent to live</l>
					<l>with a Neighbour where I heard and saw all sorts of bad things had not our </l>
					<l>dear Saviour had a perticular Hand over me I should have been ruined in Soul</l>
					<l>and Body, when I was there they sent me into a Field to work where I was</l>
					<l>so cold that I had no feeling of Hands nor Feet nor could I come to any</l>
					<l>House, all on a sudden it came in my mind that God could warm me and I grew</l>
					<l>directly warm this was the first time I knew that God could here us or know </l>
					<l>or know any thing of us after some time I left this place and removed into a </l>
					<l>nother place that was more agreable, here I took much to reading and intended</l>
					<l>to be very good, but amidst it all I ataind to no satisfaction but a constant</l>
					<l>condemnation follow&apos;d me with every thing I did, so far her own writing</l>
					<l>about this time she began to hear Mr Igham and when the societys of </l>
					<l>the Brn was sitled she was one of the first of that number when the </l>
					<l>S Srs Oconomy was seteld at Oxhaire she after some time had</l>
					<l>leave to be one of them where she continued for a while some time but her being</l>
					<l>of a very Leagul turn made it very heavy for her amidst of the Sisters </l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb xml:id='IMG_1267.jpg' n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>and as it coud not be perciev&apos;d that she got any satisfaction in </l>
					<l>her Heart the Labours thought it more proper for her to go and</l>
					<l>live with two or three Sisters who was under the Brns care which </l>
					<l>she took very much to heart and could hardly be persuaded to do as</l>
					<l>was however thought for the best she took it so very near that</l>
					<l>it brought on a violent sickness for as she her self expresst it</l>
					<l>coud never bear to be Defard of the fellowship of living in the</l>
					<l>midst of Sisters, and yet at the same she was in her heart very</l>
					<l>dry and her being so very self righteous made it very heavy </l>
					<l>for her to feel as a Sinner depart alone upon our Saviour and</l>
					<l>this has been ameans of her course being some what heavy in the</l>
					<l>Congregation, and so she continued removeing for some time from place</l>
					<l>to place to place by the direction of the Brn when at last she got</l>
					<l>leave to go and live with some Sisters at the Home where she</l>
					<l>began to feel a little more of her self and was brought</l>
					<l>in to very great concern about her Salvation but as she was</l>
					<l>once coming from a meeting this verse was perticularly aplyd to </l>
					<l>her Heart, Out of pure Grace unmerited, Salvation Show&apos;rs</l>
					<l>on our Head Merely because the Lord had dy&apos;d, Because a Lamb</l>
					<l>was Crucify&apos;d, Are we invited to possess a Throne, Before the </l>
					<l>World was made ordaind our own, and she was from this time made</l>
					<l>sure of her Election* when the Choir House was begun at Fulneck</l>
					<l>she with some others Out of the Oeconomys got leave <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>from Richard</hi></l>
					<l><hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>Mortimer</hi> to remove with them to that in Pudsey, but here it </l>
					<l>she did not spend her time so chearfully as could have been wish&apos;d  </l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>for she lost many happy hours for her own heart thro&apos; looking so much</l>
					<l>at others and being so very strict with her self she could not</l>
					<l>easily look over things that some times accurd amongst her compan</l>
					<l>ions, yet at the same time we cannot denigh but as to her true </l>
					<l>Heart to her Choir and the Congn we was fully persuaded which </l>
					<l>in 54 she had the grace to be  </l>
					<l>show&apos;d it self evedintly on various occasions, in the year 1754 </l>
					<l>July The Diciple and Dicipless pay&apos;d a visit to the Congn and this</l>
					<l>the earnest request of the Sister of that Ocemomey to come into</l>
					<l>the Choir House at Fulneck the Diciple took it into con</l>
					<l>sideration and it was made out that the said Oeconomy should</l>
					<l>be entirely broken up, and so she with the rest of her Sisters</l>
					<l>came here into this House where she continued very chearfull</l>
					<l>for some time and cou&apos;d not express her self enough of the joy</l>
					<l>She felt that she was now got to her right home, but thro&apos;</l>
					<l>her very strict way of thinking she brought her self into <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>many</hi></l>
					<l>great heavyness and deprivd her self of the Holly Communin for some</l>
					<l>time she spoke with her Laboures in avery open hearted manner</l>
					<l>of her whole situation and it was plain to be percevd that she</l>
					<l>must be dealt with perticlar love and tenderness which her Labours</l>
					<l>show&apos;d to her at at that time and it was a great means of bringing</l>
					<l>her to a clearness again in her Heart in the year 1763 complan</l>
					<l>ing much of a pain in her Head she was advisd to a Cold Bath</l>
					<l>which removed the pain in her Head but soon after it was percived</l>
					<l>that the desorder seteld upon her Loungs and she was much</l>
					<l>troubled with a voilent Cough, but in a short time grew better again</l>
					<l>and it was made out that she shou&apos;d go for some time into the  </l>

				<lg>
					<l>Childrens Oeconomy Wash Kitchen where she showd the </l>
					<l>greatest faith fullness, but thro&apos; the desorder in her Loungs she</l>
					<l>was oblig&apos;d to be taken back again, and she her self believd that it</l>
					<l>would prove a means of her disolution thus she continued in a pritty chearful</l>
					<l>way and was made use of as an over seer in a Work Room and it</l>
					<l>was the greatest favour to her to do any thing for her Choir and never</l>
					<l>thought any thing too much but on the contrary lookd upon it as the </l>
					<l>greatest grace and favour, Sep<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>br</hi> ye 16<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>th</hi> she had the favour to be </l>
					<l>added amongst the company of Intersesers which prov&apos;d a pertic</l>
					<l>lar blessing for her own heart that she had the favour to have</l>
					<l>an hour to speak with our in a Perticlar manner for her own and </l>
					<l>his Peoples cause, it was plain to be percevd amidst all her faults</l>
					<l>and wants that her heart was truly connected with our Sav<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>and atached to her choir, but the Sinner track being not alway</l>
					<l>clear to her interupted her in that tender atachment to his Person</l>
					<l>in beginning of Oct<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>br</hi> she took entirely to the Sick room where she</l>
					<l>spent her time cheerily in fullness when at <hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>any</hi> time she was spoken</l>
					<l>with she always complaind of <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>her</hi> not feeling herself in that </l>
