					<l>North of England</l>
					<l>Memoir of our late B<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Jacob Borck who</l>
					<l>departed at Bedford. Oct. 24. 1791</l>
					<l>Our late Bro. having left no written account</l>
					<l>of his Life, we can only say the following:</l>
					<l>He was born at Arendal in Norway Oct. 13. 1727.</l>
					<l>He lost his Father when very Young, the pray</l>
					<l>ers &amp; admonitions of his Mother who was a</l>
					<l>pious Woman &amp; sought to Educate him in the</l>
					<l>nurture &amp; admonition of the Lord were a great</l>
					<l>blessing to him, as a Child, &amp; when at 14 Years of</l>
					<l>In age he went to Copenhagen &amp; there become Sur</l>
					<l>geons Mate in the Danish Army, having been</l>
					<l>brought up in that time of Life; In 1756 he enterd</l>
					<l>Into the Service of the Russians army as Surgeon,</l>
					<l>&amp; being in Russia, he was noticed by several</l>
					<l>persons of the highest Rank, both on Account</l>
					<l>of his engaging manners &amp; Skilfulness in is</l>
					<l>profession, especially by the Viceroy of Ukraine</l>
					<l>who greatly favord him, &amp; with whom he</l>
					<l>travelled thro various parts of Russia, but thro</l>
					<l>these conexions he was led into bad Company, &amp;</l>
					<l>sinful habits, by which means he lost those</l>
					<l>impressions of our Saviours grace, which he</l>
					<l>had received in his Younger Years when he</l>
					<l>had been solidly awakened, &amp; obtained a view</l>
					<l>in Spirit of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> sufferings, which remain</l>
					<l>ed unforgetten by him. He however felt</l>
					<l>great uneasiness of mind, amidst the gaieties</l>
					<l>&amp; pleasures of the World, which he once disclosed</l>

					<l>to a person of Rank in Russia acquainted with</l>
					<l>the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> especially with Count Zinzendorff, who</l>
					<l>spoke to him in and enrcourageng manner, &amp;</l>
					<l>whose conversation was greatly blessed to him</l>
					<l>the above mentioned person at the same time</l>
					<l>related to him several particulars concerning</l>
					<l>the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> which created a wish in him,</l>
					<l>to become more nearly acquainted with them.</l>
					<l>Accordingly in 1739 when he quitted Russia, he</l>
					<l>resolved to pay a visit to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at Zeist, intend</l>
					<l>ing to go from thence to England, to enter into his</l>
					<l>Majestys Service on board a Westindia Ship. The first</l>
					<l>meeting he attended at Zeist was a singing meeting</l>
					<l>during which he was so overpowerd with a feeling of</l>
					<l>divine Grace, that it was immediately made clear</l>
					<l>to him that this was the people he belonged to, having</l>
					<l>always from his infancy had a desire to live among</l>
					<l>Children of God:, Here he also got acquainted with Count</l>
					<l>Zinzendorff, who received him very cordially, Never</l>
					<l> theless he for the present, pursued his intentions</l>
					<l>of proceeding to England, where he engaged as Sur</l>
					<l>geon onboord the Monarque in which Station he</l>
					<l>remained about a Year, during the whole of which</l>
					<l>time the Vessel lay in the harbours He kept up in</l>
					<l>the mean time an acquaintance with the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> in</l>
					<l>London: But the great Wickedness &amp; abandoned</l>
					<l>life of the Ships crews, to which he was witness was</l>
					<l>so disgusting to him, that he was glad to obtain</l>
					<l>his dissmission. After this he lodged for a short time</l>
					<l>with a B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in London &amp; being desirous of coming</l>
					<l>into still closer connection with the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></l>

					<l>went in Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1760 according to their advice to Bedford</l>
					<l>where he moved into the Single B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> House.</l>
					<l>Tho he had it at first very hard in externals yet he</l>
					<l>never Ussined,? but was always thankful to our</l>
					<l>Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> for having brought him thither, &amp; used to express</l>
					<l>himself to that effect, that he should esteem it the</l>
					<l>greatest favor to live with Children of God, were he even</l>
					<l>necessitated to live on Bread &amp; Water. He first engaged</l>
					<l>with the late Doc. Vowel as a partner in business, but</l>
					<l>after sometime this partnership was dissolved, &amp;</l>
					<l>the set up for himself as Surgeon &amp; Apothecary.</l>
					<l>He was received in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> April 20 1761 &amp; admitted</l>
					<l>to the holy Comunion Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 26 in the same Year.</l>
					<l>Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1766 he was married to the S. Sister Hanah</l>
					<l>Scorfield of the Choir House at Fulnec, his present</l>
					<l>Widow by whom he has had one Daughter, now a</l>
					<l>member of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at Bedford, He was very success</l>
					<l>full in his profession, whereby he also proved a bless</l>
					<l>ing to many of his patients in their dying mom</l>
					<l>ents, was respected in the Town &amp; neighbourhood,</l>
					<l>&amp; always a steady Friend to the poor even to his own</l>
					<l>disadvantage. Tho his warm &amp; positive temper</l>
					<l>&amp; disposition sometimes caused him trouble,</l>
					<l>Yet his upright Sincere &amp; generous mind pro</l>
					<l>cured him many Friends by whom he was much</l>
					<l>esteemed, The reflection on his past unfaithful</l>
					<l>ness to our Saviours Grace, &amp; the powerful sensa</l>
					<l>tions he had of his great depravity, caused him</l>
					<l>indeed many heavy hours, but amidst all this he</l>
					<l>cleaved as a poor pardoned Sinner to his Redeemer</l>

					<l>&amp; experienced rich comforts from him, which was</l>
					<l>more especially perceptible in the last years of his</l>
					<l>Life, when he grew more chearful &amp; happy &amp; resigned</l>
					<l>His constitution which was naturally strong,</l>
					<l>had been much impaired by fatiague of body &amp;</l>
					<l>mind, about 5 Years ago he got a paralitic Stroke</l>
					<l>which greatly enfeabled him, Since this time he</l>
					<l>suffered greatly from increasing weakness, which</l>
					<l>at last brought on a total delay of strength. His</l>
					<l>present Widow our dear Sister Borck, has shew&apos;n</l>
					<l>great &amp; unremitting tenderness in faithfully nur</l>
					<l>sing him during this long period of illess. Amidst</l>
					<l>his sufferings which was very great, his patience</l>
					<l>was exemplary, &amp; he always expressed himself</l>
					<l>thankful for the least services done him.</l>
					<l>When visited his favorite topick was the Love &amp;</l>
					<l>forbearance of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> so consisintly displayed</l>
					<l>in the mercy shewn to him, being plucked as</l>
					<l>a brand out of the fire. Several weeks before</l>
					<l>his departure it was evident, that he would not</l>
					<l>continue long here below, from which time</l>
					<l>forward, his mind seemed wholly disengaged</l>
					<l>from all earthly cares, &amp; occupied in converse</l>
					<l>with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, he frequently prayed fervently</l>
					<l>to him, entreating our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to strengthen him &amp;</l>
					<l>support him in his trouble, &amp; especially to be</l>
					<l>near him in his last hours, He once told a</l>
					<l>Brother who visited him that altho he had the</l>

					<l>full assurance that he should go to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></l>
					<l>as an absolved sinner, yet he could not deny</l>
					<l>that he felt some dread at the thoughts of the</l>
					<l>separation of Soul &amp; Body, but some days</l>
					<l>after he intimated to the same Brother, that</l>
					<l>he could now say with thanks to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></l>
					<l>that this dread had been entirely removed.</l>
					<l>A day or two before his departure, he expressed</l>
					<l>in a very emphatical manner, his thankful</l>
					<l>ness for having brought him to his ransom&apos;d</l>
					<l>Congregation &amp; sealed his Salvation.</l>
					<l>Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1791 he was no longer able to speak,</l>
					<l>&amp; from that time lay Still in sweet expectati</l>
					<l>on of that blessed moment when his Redeemed</l>
					<l>Soul should be translated into the mansions</l>
					<l>of bliss. This favor was granted him about</l>
					<l>nine oClock the same Evening when he</l>
					<l>departed softly &amp; happily aged 64 years 11 days</l>
					<l>Blessed are the dead, which die in the</l>
					<l>Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit,</l>
					<l>that they may rest from their Labour, &amp;</l>
					<l>their works do follow them. Rev<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> 14. 13</l>
