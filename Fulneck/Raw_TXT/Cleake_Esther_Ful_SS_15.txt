London th
1718
I think my dear Brn & Srs will Like to
hear Somthing of my Course thro this time which
I gladly do, what may be to the Honour of my Dr Savir
I was Born at Kirton in Lincolnshire
my parants died when I was young so was left
an orphan to providence or to my dr. Creator
and Savir for whom I was Born destined Shurely.
To tell my Dr Brn & Srs of the goodness, the mercy
and kindness, The love and faithfulness of my Dr
Lord and Savir to me a poor Child, my weak words
fall very short to Express the praise that is due
to Him, from he, for his wonders have been without
tale or end, thanks, thousand thanks be, to the
Lamb for ever, and ever.
But I will endeavour to recollect Some particu
lars of the tender leading of my gracious and most
faithful Lord I coud fill a Book which I woud
gladly do to the praise of Him who desires much more
than I can give the furst Impression of grace
I remember was when about 4 years old.
kneeling by a chair with a Book in which was that
words Seek and ye Shall find knock and it shall
be opend unto you I felt Somthing particular at ye time
I had a very quick understanding for my years
and a very Sencible feeling of what was right and
wrong I wanded to be a good child that I might
go to Heaven on that acct I was much praised
which woud have been more hurtful to me But the
Dr. Holy Ghost who had begun his work in my
heart Shewd me Continualy my wicked and sinful
Nature which kept me low and Consious that I
did not deserve that praise, which was a grace to me
at that time


of it Checked by Satanick pride which I felt very
Sencible, yet from many Circumstances I thought god
must love me, But how it was I coud not tel, I was
a Sinner. In my 11 year was very thoughtful and
Destrest felt guilt with another Impression that I did
not love God, nor coud not praise Him which one
time a little Bird was made use of to Shew me that I
coud not praise my Creator even as a Bird. I had
also Strange Ideas about Him what Form he shud
have and was much perplext about it but by a Dream
I thought God almighty was in a parlour in a
House where I was and that he was a man I
was glad, then I thought one coud be Familliar
with him But not understanding the gracious
leading of my Dear Saviour, I continued Extreamly
Destrest thought I comitted Sin every moment by the
Strange thoughts I had, and thay was of Such a nature
I coud not tel them to any Body nor woud thay under
stood me, but weried indeed with trying to help
my self, a thought came in my mind as I cant
help these thoughts God almighty has nothing
against me, in that moment my Compassionate Saviour
drew near with his love and mercy gave me peace
and as if he had Said to me I have nothing against
thee I was amaized, but didnt how to acct for it, to be
lovd by God and in Such a manner, from that time
when those thoughts came again I coud believe he had
nothing against me for it, but not understanding the
right poor Sinner path, I came into an Extream
Self rightious Course Striveing with all my might to be
good, by other means then Jesus Blood I got into fast
ing and praying wanting to be as good as the primitive
Christians and I did not like any one Shud he Better then
my self here my Satinck pride shewd it self to a great de
gree as how unwilling I was to be Saved by Grace. I went
on in this course in a provdential manner I came to London
for my Aunt who Brought up died and I became second
time can orphan She treated me as if she had know my
Destination


all wonder of my Dr Saviours love which I did not then under
stand, and it woud be to tedious here to relate, I was in my
14 year when I came to London into Lady Scarbro
Family who Sent for me to wait on her little neice
and my dear Savr gave it into her heart from the furst moment
to be remarkable kind to me as a made and the whole Family Shewd
great regard and respect for my religous turn of mind
which felt was Sincere (not on Acct of outward gifts
or qualification) but the Dr Holy Ghost in whose School
I then was, gave me a constant sence of my depraved
Nature in all it Shapes, and finding I fell so far short
of that I thought I Shud be, this kept me low and in
some Sense Humble, and kept the Ballance against
that hurtful praise which is often given
I also lived in other Family till I was about 27 such
as Lord Orrory, whose little Daughter I waited on
at Ld Scarbrough, he married and took me with her home
Ld Charlot Edwin and with a Daughter of the Duke
of Buckelugh and how my Dr Savr and great faithful
Shepherd Kept me thro with all my Imperfections
So wonderfuly, So that if I may Humble Say so, I found
favour with God, and man, but I nor no body els thought
what was preparing for me In my 26 year I returnd to
Ld Scarbro who always recd me of my mother with uncommon
regard, at this time I begun again into self working to and
amaizing degree by prayer and fasting so was weried
of a Great House may be this way in the year 42 It
Hapend once when at prayer I felt Somthing very Blessed in
it was quick like the Shooting of a Star but it was my all
that was good it was light, peace, joy, all Hapiness in one
moment, I thought it was the Holy Spirit, and woud pray
to feel more of it, soon after I red a letter coming concerning
the preaching of the Methodists which I had never heard, for 
I was so Biggoted to the Church and it a Shame to go any where its
and was my Eggarans of any other profession but now I thought
I will inquire about them, So it Hapened a Methodist came in my
way and in hearing what was said I was convince of what I want
ed the knowledge of the atonement of our Savr for my Sins
that all his gracious leading was Brought to my mind, so that I
know it was a truth from god, the person lent me a Sermon
Book of Mr Whitfield the more I read the more it was opend


opend to me my case that I wanted a Saviour my mind took
a turn and I found ??? from my Heavy Labour and Savr that
it was this Rightiousnes that I wanted Now I Entered with my
whole mind in the matter, got all the Books I coud of that kind
amongst the Rest I got the Brn little Hymn Book which Suited
me exceedingly Especially one verse viz If I a glimse in my
own Breast feel of  Christians Bliss. then on the truth of
it let me rest that such a life there is. at length my good
Ld found I had got Methodist Books but did not think I was
To deep in the Matter for She had a Better opinion of me then
I woud follow such people but one time being with her at Court
She caught me reading a letter which she took from me where
She found I been once at the Tabernacls. She was much
concernd and took the greatst pains posible to deswade
me from it but I was Devinely convince of the truth
of the Gospel and never waverd one moment, my Lady
forbid me going, I told her I woud not with out leting her
know and I thought I could do with Books here the Family
went into the Country where was a good friend a Minister
who took great pains to prevent me going So Deep in
those things Brought me many Books but to no purpose
my heart was convince assurd of the truth, we returnd to London
and I grew very unease and found I coud not do with out
going to here the preaching so Desired leave which coud
not he granted. my good Lady was now very much De
stress about me. She wanted very much to keep me, and
out of love and kindness she did her utmost to prevent it
She wanted me again to be advised by Some Minister I Chose
the Bishop of Oxford  Sackis I was so clear in my
matter and truth of it, I feard nothing I went with my Bro
who accused me of leaveing the Church I said it was
because thay didnt preach of our Saviour Sufferings
and I was fully assured that nothing would Save me, this was
aproved of as to good works I said to the Bishops when
the Tree is good the fruit will be good he was very
tender with me Saw I was Sincere, and if it was possible I
was more confirmd in my point my Dear Lady was
disapointed and much to be pitied but I could not help it.
here she rested, she had done all she coud, but my Matter
remained to leave hir, or have leave to go to the preaching
at last I coud do no longer So went to here the preaching,
and I was wanted before I got home, my Lady askt me
where I had told her she said I had gone with out leave I
said his Ladyship woud not have given me leave if I had askt


upon that she sent me out of the room to see me no more
one thing which made his unwilling to sleep me if I went
to the preaching was fear of the Children and Servants and
when I went with her to Court it was then a shame to be
a Methodist But my Dear Saviour had prepared my way
for me I went to Bed as composed as If nothing had happend
and in the morning I got up like Bird out of a cage and
went to the Tabernacle by 6 a clock from Cavendish Square
of I have said it was a wonder of God, for I had nothing,
no respect, outwardly how I shud live or get my Bread
I had very little mony many hard things was set before me
and in my self nothing to depend on, no quaintance with him
our Dear Saviour words became Literally true
Seek furst the kingdom of God and it Rightiousness
and all things shall he added unto you
I was a Child turnd out of Doors (was again an orphan)
but my ever faithful Lord whose Hand and Eye was over me
cared for every Step my Lady gave one prove more of her
kindness to me finding had no aquaintans sent me word
that I Shud Lodge there till I shud get one, the Servants and all
was amaized because I was otherwise no person of courage
but thay didnt know that I had found the pearl of
Great price etc. now I went to me Brother in the Day
till the preaching time at the Taber: my Br was shy and let
me alone, He was very Sorry for my leaveing so good a
place But he lookt into my Books made a good
observation and said all protesations make the Scriptures
there rule; but if this Inward feeling can be true it most
Come from God it pleaesed my to here him say to much
I inquired of my Br for the Brn Chapel where my little
Hymn Book belonged He directed me but when I came 
there was no preaching I thought I will Enquire at the
Chapel House Sr Wheeler kindly askt me to come in this was in Feb. 1744
Shewd me the Chapel and what she told me at that time of
our Savrs Ruleing amongst his people made such an
Impression on me that I never forgot, it Tallied with my
own Experiance I inquiryed after the Countess of Zenzindor
if she might want a Servant. She was not in England
here I believe it was a great Mercy for me that I had not
much mony for I shud have been exposed to many danger
in takeing a Lodging, for I shud have recd all that had Spoke
about his Saviour I knowd no differences, in the end after
about a week I went to Speake with Mr Whitfield to
advize with him


him and I heard of Lady Huntington perhaps she might
help me thro him, but to the Wound of my most faithful
Lord. I was in no perplexity tho I Saw not the least way
I knowd my cause was good. I found Mr Whitfeld at Br
John Sims, I told my Case quite Symply and the Br Sims
his particular according to her usual kind way in such Cases
took me in, So I left my good Lady and all my friends
with gratful thanks for all her kindness amazeings and I
pray she may not lose her reward. I coud do no other but
follow my Gracious Lord & Savr Br & Sr Sims cared for me
as a Child, their Love tenderness and patienc I shall 
never forget and I am ever in their Dept Mr Whitefield
and his wife was also very kind but Mr Whit went to
George in a bout Six weeks, which Broke that Connexion
and Br Sims Being atached to the Brn I often went with
them to Fetterlane so by degrees came in Conexion tho
for that time I Recd much Blessing in going to the Taber
but Br Sims moved from Hodgson So Dropt going In
finely and to the tabernacle my good Lord lead me Step by Step as it pleased
him inwardly and outwardly in a most gracious manner
which Brings to mind a few lines, With patience
Immense and love So Intense, he hath led on
I am lost in amazement their when thinking
there on, Now Being come to my proper Home the Dr
Congn when I have Injoyed nothing but Blessing more
then I can express thay have been So many and So great
and my heart in the Dr Congn So clear and So weighty.
and Say can love reset to our Savr the Dearst thing to me
I am a Sinner to whom belongs nothing but shame
and Confusion of face, but it has pleased him to open
to me the Treasure of his love and great Salvation
which has been treated to me by his Spirit by his word
by his Congn (as Tallies) as an Elevnat truths
for such way my make I must know it as a truth for
my self way truely Convince of unbelieve and can say
of all Sins a curst also my Enmity against our Savr
but when it came to the Highest pitch I felt
if there was another Savior I woud have him Condemnd
for the thought in that moment I was over powerd
with his love and peace and of if he said for all this I
the the feeling and Impression of his nearness bowd
own in the Dust before my gracious Lord and it
ended with


with those words. The poor Sinner Happy feeling the Holy Shame
but my self righteous man woud, Stil ???? me in various shapes but in that
feeling that verse was sealed to me as the greatest truth
o precious precious Blood, the only Holiness that Good
Stil Doop an flow & cover me a cursted Sinner without
the preaching, the Hymns, the Scriptures, where opend thee
with such couth and life which I cant Decribe, but
now I am in this strain I cant but go further tho
it leads me in a feild But my Dear Brn & Srs may
take from it what thay please I left Br Sims
with gratful thanks for all their care and want to Mr
Delmots at Black Heath to care for Bettey Holland
whose parants where gone to Germany here I
experienced Somthing particular, in the furst place
to my Shame I was Shown great love an respect from
the Dear Family to Whome I am Bound by tender love and
Gratitude ever to acknowledge but what relates to the
Heart as particular was as I have said the preaching had
been to Blest that tho first was often Imprest on my
mind the week before So I that I thought I shall speake
out in the Chapel, that is true. Being now all at once
taken from preaching and all meetings what was
amazeing, I injoy such a Sabatic Stillness and the
Sun Shine of peace for that time that I wanted nothing
but was indeed as a child on the Breast I was not yet
In the Congn tho I had went some time; the Family came
to London and B Holland parants came from Ger. so I 
went with Bettey to live with them but Bettey soon
went to the occono in Mile end. I know thought much
about reception but it was still some time which was very
wholesom for me, I one time was particular comforted
by those words I used thy affair will think on as thy ????
loveing head; at length the Hour Struck certainly
in the right moment the Devine Impression upon it
was I am now in my Fathers House this was May
the 18 old Stile 1747 and Sept the 2 following had the
unspeakable grace which word was Impress on my mind on that
day when when I was a partaker of my Dear Savr Body & Blood
in the Holy Sacret in this period that how good and Blest
was every thing the Liturgies and Solomn meeting beyond
my Expression But in I had the Grace to feel that in my
self I I was poor Creature truely Convince no one worse


had ??? feeling of Sin in all ???? which pride Self
produces with the whole train of abomanation on this point
I coud Say much to my Shame of the trouble I have given the
Dear Holy Ghost to Keep me a Sinner Such as me shud be
my Brn & Sr will understand me what that is a solid feeling
what is Sin but not to work Sin God Forbid
In this year I went to Mile end for the children here I had some
openings of his love and grace Especially relating to my
own Choir grace and I was Devinely Drawn to read
the Canticles, and those Delicases of our Dr Savr love
to his Chruch was opened to me with Such truth and 
realtity as I cant express however opend as it was
to See wonderful Beauties it was again closed
to me as clear as if it had been done by our Saviour
own hand By that verse althou the fairest of
Mankind, whose Beauty Strikes Both Heart
Mind But nothing is So fair in the as thy
sweet form upon the ??? and can thro his love
and grace Say nothing has So Strock me as when 
god's Spirit took me to Golgotha o God
be praised. also for leading me more and more in 
to that Matter of Matters which, I hope will continue
till I Behold Him face to face. in this time it is well
know was a period of Some Extravegance (Be it So)
I was at it happend not in them, But for my self
I am truly Convince by my own Experience that
There was a glory from the Lord Indeed to great
for Earthly Minds long to bear but I expect to See
it again in its full glory without a vail between
and with his Sinner brain Surround that Cavity
where I shall Dwell Eternally that verse Suits here
which was So realized in this time by which I will
conclude this unpreakable matter To be enamoured
I know well, to have the heart quite over flowing
for him alone to be So glowing Expression only
me here here fail.


I about this time I also had a new School for
my Heart concerning the virgin Station, and found
that only by partakeing of the Nature of the only virgin
Man one Coud Deserve that Charecter these words
was made very Clear - Fair gifts of my creation
quite spilled made the Dispair for this Grace
the Knowlede of my self, (in this particular) I adore
and thank my Lord the Dr Holy Ghost for that Grace, that
was made a means to turn to His precious Blood
which alone can Cleanse our hearts and make all
good. I found it a antidote and help against
all those Sins that stick So close, as self love
self Complaince and a well known brain of
such kind which pride produces - his Grace is
sufficient I thro Mercy Now.
It seems time to come to a conclusion tho many
things comes in mind. In the year 51 I was sent
from Mile end to Ockbrook to care for the Srs there
and Sept 16 57 left Ockbrook to go to Tetherton
and came there on Angels Festival this was so
Blessed a jorney I never can forget thro the near
ness of my gracious Lord and Impresion of the aid
of his Dear Angels, left Titherton July 19 1763
returnd again to Ockbrook, from thence to London
Decbr 11 72 where I hope to finish my poor and
Insignificant Labour In all those places in Sweet
and or wholesome poverty inwardly and ouwardly
His Dear Hand has Brought me thro and I can say with
his deciples I have lacked nothing have been rich in the
midest of poverty, here I woud once more give my due
thanks to my Dr Brn & Srs and particularly those of my own
Choir for their love kindness & patience towards me
but what is due to my Dearst and Best friend and lover
for His Election of grace and for the knowledge of his Dr
wounded person his precious Blood and all what
he is to me I conclude with the 30th verse of the 43
chapter of Ecclesiasticus which will express my mind
