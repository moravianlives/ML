               <p>the first line of the <name event="communion">Holy Communion</name>, Sake often used to relate that this period from her receiption till she had the favour to injoy the Holy Communion was
                  the most remarkable in her life, it was the time when she learned to know herself, and as a poor undone Sinner found grace in our <hi rend="superscript"><roleName type="honorific"
                        >saviors</roleName></hi> sight. In the before mentioned sitiation she served 29 years with great faithful, ness on which account she was respected, she had many difficulties to
                  struggle with, and had <hi rend="superscript">it </hi>very hard in the be ginning, but she looked to our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> for help, and often expressed
                  her gratitude for what he had done for her. -- Being rather of a selfrighteous turn and not the best temper, it was at times troublesome for those who as here con nected with her,
                  but knowing her intentions were good, every allowence were made. In <date when-iso="1802">1802</date> she came to live in the <placeName>Sisters House</placeName> here, being
                  troubled with the <name type="health" subtype="ilness">Rheumatism</name>; and feeling her self not able to continue in her past, this was however <hi rend="superscript">a</hi> great
                  trial to her, being ased to an aitife life, she could not compass mind to have nothing to do besides she felt sich an atah ment to her School and the Children, that she hartly ever
                  got over it, we had often to shear and comfort her on that account. The few years she spent in in our house she was way <name type="health">weak</name> and <name type="health"
                     >infirm</name>, in <date when-iso="1809">spring 1809</date> it appeared as if she was going in a decline, but she recovered a little again, and it terminatedin a <name
                     type="health">dropsy</name>, from since the beginning of this year she labored under <name type="health">much pain and sufferings</name>, some times the time would appear long to
                  her before our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> would realise her, but upon the whole she bore her pains with patience and regin resignation to our <roleName
                     type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> will, and prayed often to him to claanee her in his precious blood form every stain, that she may as a pardoned sinner appear him. This favour
                  was granted to her <date type="death" when-iso="1810-06-21">June 21</date>, when she happily fell asleep in <persName type="deity">Jesus</persName>. Aged nearly 67 years. </p>
