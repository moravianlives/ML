					glomy I thought Shurly there is not one that is So Spoiled &amp; So <lb/>
					full of evel as I am, but the Convictions which felt I never went <lb/>
					In no Gross sins yet I felt a love for Sin &amp; begun a self working <lb/>

					Let me feell what I was by nature &amp; allso that it was just such that <lb/>
					our <roleName type="honorific">Sav</roleName> came to save, but I being of a reasoning turn it seemed <lb/>
					to be made to very esey &amp; except I felt our <roleName type="honorific">Savs</roleName> Nearness so clear as <lb/>
					&amp; I allmost saw him I dare not beleve &amp; so Long as I have not this <lb/>
