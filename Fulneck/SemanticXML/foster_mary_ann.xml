					<p> A Sketch of the life &amp; happy departure of <persName ref="#mlper000243">Mary Ann Foster</persName> who died at <placeName ref="#mlpla000030">Bristol</placeName>, <date
							type="death" when-iso="1789-04-09">April 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1789</date>. From her cradle to her death it may be said that she was an affectionate &amp;
						pleasing child, discovering an uncommon sensibility in all things for one of her age. As early as three years old she frequented the <name event="religious">Childrens
							Meetings</name> at the <placeName>Brethen&apos;s Chapel</placeName>; it was evident that he tender mind was impressed not with dread but with a pleasant serenity whenever
						she heard of death &amp; going to dwell with our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>, On attening the funeral of a Child about her own age, she afterwards asked one
						of her companions, if she should like to die &amp; be buried like <hi rend="underline"><persName>Maria Grinfield</persName></hi><note type="bottom">(who died at the age of
							three years &amp; a quarter)</note> her companion replied &quot;no&quot; to which she she said, I am sure I should, </p>

					<p> for thou I should for to my dear <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> -- on being asked if she did not fear the Gloomy grave &quot;Oh no she replied our <roleName
							type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> was laid in the Grave &amp; I am not afraid, my soul will go to him when I die, &amp; I shall be drest in white &amp; praise him with
						all the little Angels for ever &amp; ever!&quot;</p>
					<p> The discourse delivered at that funeral made a deep impression on her tender heart she went home to her Momma &amp; relative all she could remember of it &amp; said she should
						ask her forgiveness as <hi rend="underline">Maria</hi> did of her Momma &amp; Papa before she died adding, my dear Momma, you will I know frogive me for our Saviours sake
						because I am his, he has only lent me to you for a little while, her Papa said, &quot;Maryann what is it you say,&quot; she replies, Papa <hi rend="underline">you</hi> would
						not understand it if I told <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, but Momma does. In her morning and evening prayers she entreated her dear </p>
					<pb />
					<p>
						<roleName type="honorific">Savivor</roleName> to forgive her all her Sins, &amp; prepare her for his heavnly Kingdom that she would thank him for all his love while here &amp;
						sing his praises for ever she often concluded with this verse out of her little hymn book </p>
					<p>
						<lg type="stanza" n="1">
							<l>But Saviour dear thou for my good</l>
							<l>Wast pleased a child to be</l>
							<l>And thou didst shed thy precious blood</l>
							<l>Upon the cross for me. </l>
						</lg>
						<lg type="stanza" n="2">
							<l>2</l>
							<l>Come then &amp; take this heart of mine</l>
							<l>O take me as Iam</l>
							<l>I know that I by right am thine</l>
							<l>Thou loving gracious Lamb.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p> She could often remark on the <roleName type="honorific">Lords</roleName> goodness to her, and say that she wanted for no good thing, while many poor Children were in wants of
						every thing tho&apos; she was no better then they were. On <name event="religious">Easter day</name> she asked why it was so called she was told because our <roleName
							type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> rose in the east and then said, what shall in heaven? her friend replied, we shall sing the song of <persName type="biblical"
							>Moses</persName> and the <roleName type="honorific">Lamb</roleName>&quot; Oh that will be delightful she said, how I long to die that I may go to my dear <roleName
							type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>, then </p>

					<p> I shall love him more for I shall see him and be with him for ever. In the night season, she would often wake and say here is darkness, in heaven there is always light our dear
							<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> is the light &amp; the glory there we shall sing the with the Angels Hallelujah praise the <roleName type="honorific"
							>Lord</roleName>. One morning hearing the servant singing a vain song, she went to her &amp; repeated the following verse </p>
					<p>
						<lg type="stanza" n="1">
							<l>&quot;Stop poor sinner stop and think</l>
							<l>Before you further go</l>
							<l>Will you sport upon the brink</l>
							<l>Of evrlasting one?</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p> O Molly, said she you are not singing our <roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> praise, if you do not begin here, you never will in heaven, remember I told you so
						&amp; if ever you tell his, you will go the bottomless pit, where <persName type="biblical">Satan</persName> is, Oh Molly repent and call on our <roleName type="honorific"
							>Saviour</roleName> for Mercy, that you may be saved. On the Saturday before her <name health="disease">last illness</name>, she went to dine with a friend, and appeared
						uncommonly thoughtful, &amp; was asked if any thing had greivd her - no; but I have a secret to tell you, but Momma must not know it because it will vex her, but she will </p>
					<pb />
					<p> know it by and bye, dear Maryann what can that be, that your Momma must not know, she replied with a frightened countenance, I an going to leave you not to <placeName
							ref="#mlpla000054">London</placeName> where Momma thinks to send me to school, &amp; has so many new dresses for me, but I shall want none of them for I shall have a dress
						where I am going which shall be always white &amp; looking up to heaven with her little hands folded together she said, I am going far above those clouds, I am going to My dear
							<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>, who is in heaven, he will give a crown of gold &amp; a white robe &amp; I shall lay my crown at his feet, &amp; I will fall
						down at his feet &amp; worship him with all the little Angels in white, her friend said, how will you know our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> for we read in the
						Revelations that St John was mistaken &amp; was going to worship an Angel instead of the Lord Jesus, she said, I shall not mistake for our dear <roleName type="honorific"
							>Saviour</roleName> was crucified, you know they nailed </p>

						<hi rend="underline">Him</hi> to the Cross by his hands &amp; by his feet, &amp; they peirced his side, I shall know him by his wounds, &amp; I will Sing in heaven hallelujah
						praise the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> &amp; All hail the power of <persName type="deity">Jesus</persName> name </p>

					<p> The week following on the <date when-iso="1829-04-04">4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of April</date> she was seized with a <name health="disease">putrid sore throat And
							fever</name>, she suffered with such uncommon patience as astonished all around her, to a friend that visited her she said with a smile I am doing to sing the song Moses
						&amp; the <roleName type="honorific">Lamb</roleName> before you - dear Momma, do not grieve for me, I am soon going to our dear <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>,
						he has only lent me to you for a little while if you lose me you will give me up to him, do not cry, because Maryann is going to heaven, you will come by &amp; bye, we shall
						meet again - Momma let be he burried like the Sisters &amp; let all the Sisters have </p>
					<pb />
					<p> gloves and ribbons and meet around my coffin with the Minister to sing verses, and afterwards follow me in white to the grave, her Momma answered her that it should be as she
							<hi rend="strikethrough">wished</hi> desired, she also begged that her coffin might be like <persName>Maria Grinfield</persName>&apos;s which was granted, she said, I
						should like so be buried in the Chapel burying ground, but I cannot expect that, as I am not in the Society you know, but never mind, my soul will be with our dear <roleName
							type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>, my body shall rise from the pithole <persName>Sr James</persName>&apos;s so that is no matter - but when the weather is fine, will you
						visit my grave sometimes to remember Maryann? on the night before her departure, she attempted to sing Hallelujah praise the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> which
						she had often done, but now her throat was so bad that she could only repeat the words - The next day about noon not being able to speak her dear little hands folded together
						with her lips </p>
