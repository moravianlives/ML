					The course of Life of the SS Mary Whithead
				</p>
			<p>
					I was born in streedside in the parish of Tong, May
					10<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1737. My parents being presb<hi rend="superscript:true;">ns</hi> I was Baptz
					&amp; Educated the same religion, my father
					departed This Life when I was 7 year old &amp;
					Left my dear mother with 7 Children to struggle
					with the difficulties of Life in very <add place="above">much</add> lower
					Circumstances then she'd ever been us'd to
					The Lord blesst Her chereful endeavours
					for our suport, till such Times as we cou'd
					Earn a little for ourselves.
				</p>
			<p>
					about my 8 year I came into concern after
					my salvation, &amp; was much affected by reading
					in the Scriptures which spoke of our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>
					death &amp; sufferings, ask'd my dear mother
					what was the occasion, the resolv'd me in
					the best manner she <add place="above">was able</add> told me that Children was
					sinful creatures as well as up grown people
					&amp; that we must learn to love God &amp; not the evil
					things of this world, I was much affected &amp; Terified
					when I did ought that was not right, &amp; when
					I see my Sister going to the Meetings I desired
					to go with Her, but she refused me, however
					I &amp; some other Child<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> ventured to the Meeting
					which was kept at Rich<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> Mortimers in Holm
					Lane &amp; B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Schleet sung the verse, dearest
					Side Hole, I do covet thy warm blood above all things Viz
					&amp; spoke in the same manner over our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> death
					&amp; suffering as I had read, &amp; said no one can be saved
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_25WhiteheadMary-03.jpg" n="2" />
			<p>
				
					without they become acquainted with the man Christ
					Jesus, from this time I went constantly to the Meetings
					&amp; become I much noticed by S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Rachel Walker, who
					spoke with me about loveing the Lord Jesus, which
					made a great impression on my mind. I was soon
					received into the Children Choir &amp; Care<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> for by B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp;
					Sister Helt &amp; also went to the Children school kept
					by the Single Sisters which was a great blessing
					to my heart, from this Time I went on till my
					13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> year &amp; on the Gr Girls Festival was received
					into their choir, were a new schooling soon comm<add place="above">enced</add>.
					My Spoilt &amp; corrptd nature began to appear more
					&amp; more, &amp; tho' I would willingly have been wholy
					our d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> yet in volantary to my self my
					natural disposition wou'd have lead me into the
					world, If strong conviction from the Holy Spirit
					had not told me I shu'd be a mind &amp; undone Creature
					My Sinfulness &amp; great deviation which I felt I kept
					intirely from my Labourers, believing they neither
					knew nor felt such things as I did; therefore
					would reproach me that I wou'd not so love or be
					our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> but thought I woul'd be more communicable
					when all my Sinfulness was done away, I longed
					with Earnest to be as acquaintd with My dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp;
					have my sins forgiven, but nothing yet of this cou'd
					I attain &amp; in my 16 year I got the smallpox being
					dangerously ill I was visitd by S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Lorel Seidel
					who who Labours amongest the Girls, she ask me
					If I did not recover had I any asshurrance that
					I was our d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>, I told Her no, but I believed He
					woud have Mercy on me &amp; bring further acquaintd
					with himself before be took me Hence, of this
				
			</p>
			<cb />
			<p>
				
					Sickness I recoverd &amp; retaind a true desire in my Heart
					to become acquaintd, with My dear redeemer, yet
					I was not without intervals of turning into the world
					as I cou'd come to no realise in My Heart but since
					have seen how thro grace &amp; mercy I have been
					preserved,
				</p>
			<p>
					in the year 1757 I made known my desire to my
					Labourer to be receivd into the congregation &amp;
					resolved to give my self up to our dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
					as a spoilt poor creature as I was; without
					waiting till I <add place="above">was</add> better or Holy; with this impression
					on My Mind that as I could <add place="above">not</add> get myself freed'd
					from Sinfulness He must take me as I am for I
					cou'd wait no longer; I came to the Evening Meeting
					at fulneck the first that B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Latrobe kept after
					His arrival <add place="above">there</add>, who sung, I'll weep when're thoust
					not home Viz. &amp; kept the discourse from the same
					words, which made such an impression upon
					me, that I become like wax before the fire,
					in My returning home had the oppertunity to give
					ful vent to my Crys enterd into a field there prostratd
					with a Thousand tears before my Lambs feet
					who gave me this Happy meeting, which has been
					So momentious to me as never to be forgotten tho'
					all my future course, for this End He had followed
					&amp; preservd me to Seal me as His own.
				</p>
			<p>
					I returnd home, the rest &amp; peace My soul injoyd
					sufficed for that night without any other Slumber
					to My Eyes &amp; I was quite another Creature then before
					&amp; about 5 days after this I had the Grace July 20<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi>
					to be received into the congregation this brought
					a fresh concern upon me How I might use this
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_25WhiteheadMary-04.jpg" n="3" />
			<p>
				
					Grace according to the mind of my beloved, &amp; tho' I
					had Experienced that He had accepted of me
					in the depth of my wretchedness &amp; misery, yet
					I wanted to please Him with myself Holiness &amp;
					prittyness of Heart rather then move as a
					Sinful poor creature, in His presance
				</p>
			<p>
					in the year 1758 I was received into the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Choir
					in which I found I had many things to learn
					I felt a real desire to come unto the Choirhouse
					but as my mother, told me she shou'd not assist
					me, &amp; I feard the choirhouse Expencis wou'd be
					more then I cou'd Earn by Spinning I was much
					discouraged, but being wearied out by the daily
					calls &amp; convictions of my Heart, I came to such
					a resolution that come Life or death I must venture
					&amp; was comforted by those words, seek the kingdom of
					Heaven &amp; all other things will be added,
				</p>
			<p>
					augst. 18 1760 I injoyd the Great Grace to remove
					into the Choir house, little Expecting the unhappy<add place="above">ness</add>
					that did befall me, in this dear place I only
					injoy 12 weeks of real cherefulness before a
					most dangerous delution gaind deep Ground
					in My Heart &amp; mind, yea hourly the devils Craft
					laid Such hold on me, that I reason'd over every
					thing I heard or saw &amp; thought If I got not speedaly
					from the house I shou;d be destitute of every needful
					clothing &amp; I shou'd be oblige to go for real want
					Moreover arts was not wanting to step in to
					my assistance &amp; under pretence of going to see
					my mother, shou'd be the means I would make
					use of, haveing Made a My Matters quite
					compleat full of sly &amp; craft I ventured of
				
			</p>
			<cb />
			<p>
				
					when I had got about half way home I was all
					at once Sized with such ap that I stood
					quite still, Crying out aloud, Lord have Mercy
					what have I done, many Questions pro; &amp; con pulse
					in My heart &amp; Conscience, peter denny'd His Lord
					but peter did not deceive His B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rnn</hi> as I have
					done My Sisters; pretending to Love them &amp; had
					nothing real at the bottom. &amp; then comforting
					my self that prehep I shou'd be happy with
					my mother &amp; sisters, who received me very Gladly 
					past some time with an outward Brisk deportment
					least any <add place="above">one</add> Shoud <add place="above">see</add> alook of pennitence or condemna<add place="above">tion</add>
					which was all the while mixt with the Severest
					cutting pain, thus I went on till Christmas &amp;
					at the night watch I took Courage to venture
					<add place="margin">with out leave</add> into the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> House, Trembling &amp; frighten allmost
					out of My Sencies, yet with an asumed boldness; all
					who saw me viewd me as a Specture. Ann Birkby
					was the first who came &amp; spoke to me &amp; ask<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> me
					how I cou'd think of entering this house after such
					deceite as I had been Guilty of; Especial to the
					Labourers before whom So Lately in My Classes
					I had spoke so cherefuly &amp; satisfied, as I did,
					the truth of what she said reproach &amp; smote my very
					Heart &amp; conscience; I felt my self as a criminal before
					the place of Execution, got out of the house as fast as
					ever I could, not reflecting it was night I hasten home,
					my Eyes knew no rest for this night &amp; several more, the
					dreadful apprehenion of every moment being my Last
					was Continnualy with me, those Eyes who as flames of
					fire to the Guilty persue'd me were ever I went
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_25WhiteheadMary-05.jpg" n="4" />
			<p>
				
					in this deplorable situation I spent one whole week
					then resolved to beg forgiveness of My Choir in write, for
					without them I cou'd not bear My Life much longer
					the contents of what I wrote move'd My dear Labouress
					to send Sist<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> to me the sight of which, Suprised
					me beyond myself so that I could say very little
					to them, they comfort me in My deep distress, &amp; told me
					If it was a realite in my Heart that I coud not live
					with them, I had leave to come to all the opportunities
					of the Soccitie Sisters, my thankfulness for this was
					fare from being what it shou'd have been, for my
					pride made a further claim but this I kept at
					under all I cou'd, resolve'd to impertune My dearest
					Lamb for through restoration of My happy
					lott amongest the Sisters, &amp; begd the favour to
					Speak My self unto My Laboureres, the permission
					of which had likd to have cost me very dear, the
					Guilt &amp; distraction of My mind sized me in such a
					manner, that had not her friendly arm &amp; bosom
					been My Suport I<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> sunk down at Her feet, So is
					Enough be comfortd, &amp; feel we love you turn you to our
					d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>, &amp; If you cannot do be satisfied without
					fellowship with us, you must only Seriously consider
					that you must Expect to confirm, to the Circumstances
					&amp; regulations of our house &amp; thro' Grace suit your
					self to them, I coud from that moment have seald
					it as with my Life that those things &amp; I was but
					once a gain within the house that they wou'd never
					be any Molestation to my peace; Ah little did I
					know,
				
			</p>
			<cb />
			<p>
				
					what a poor weak Human Creature was daily yet to
					appear in me, I return'd home but with a Heavy
					Heart pour'd out my Living desires with Tears
					to be forgiven by My Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; His congregation &amp; the
					next day I felt the Grace to be a real pennitent in My
					Heart &amp; in the feeling sence of my Humility I found
					it no hard Task to beg most Earnestly forgiveness of
					my Choirs &amp; the Congregation <add place="above">by writing</add> without feeling any
					right or worthyness at all, <hi rend="underlined:true;">this was read in the Conference</hi>
					&amp; on the following Sunday the Joyful Tidings was
					imparted that I had leave to come again into the
					Choirhouse, this Humbled me into the very dust before
					My dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; on April 7<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1761 I had the Grace
					be received in the midst of my Choir within
					as humane of there love by my d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> many who told
					me that all former things should be quite forgotten
					&amp; forgiven, kiss me recomm'd me the to the Heart of
					of My beloved Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> thus I was blesst for a new beginning
					but a lass I misst the path for My Joy &amp; thankful
					ness soon abated &amp; I began to doubt over the
					Sisters not loveing me as they did one another
					My unsinnerlike way of thinking hear brought
					me into abstructedness of every kind &amp; great dry
					ness of Heart inso much that I felt my self like
					fish out of water, all which I kep intirely to my
					self thinking I should never more prosper in
					this Time, &amp; tho' I had so Lately felt what it was
					to be Seperatd from the fellowship of my Choir
					yet My pride look for more Complacency from
					the Sisters, which my foregeget [Vorsteherin] told me then I

			<p>
				
					merited or deserved, this reprove brought me
					more upon My heart then ought I had meet
					with &amp; I plainly see the fault lay intirely in
					my self, I became more Sinnerlike &amp; humble
					&amp; then love &amp; mercy pourd in upon me &amp; my
					Gracious Lord gave me leave to become a
					candidate for the Holy Sacrement Nov 20<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi>
					1761 &amp; on March 13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1762 I had the Grace
					to become a participant of the Holy Corpses
					&amp; blood which put much to shame &amp; also the
					gracious promise of the w w, of the day. I will
					make an End of all thy Morning &amp; days of Joy
					shall begin.
				</p>
			<p>
					May the following I was direct'd to keep the
					Child<hi rend="superscript:true;">rns</hi> School in the Country first Mirfield &amp;
					<add place="above">then wyke</add> which did not comprise very long; by this appearently
					I had many things to learn &amp; got a daily insight 
					of short falling, but was thankful to injoy rest
					&amp; peace again in My d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Choirhouse were Id not
					been Long before <del>before</del> I was took with an intemit

					13 week Sickness in the Sickroom which was no

					my all in all Circumstance in My course the dependant

					tho' it caused me many an heavy hour, to be thus

					the repeated sickness of our Happyly departed Sister caused
					Her many reflections of the last mention'd kind, as
					her natural Tendency was not to be burthemsom
					she applied herself industriously on all occasion that
					she might maintain herself, but our d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Lord who
					know the disposition of Her mind used all possable
					means to indear Himself unto Her heart as the
					only object to be depended on, she was very ???
					of Her own depravity, &amp; the Inclination to Serve or
					do Something for our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> was at Times such a fine as

					Her many perplexing Moments, which our D<hi rend="superscript:true;">rst</hi>
					Lord had to comfort Her very often about.
					3 months ago, Her former disorder fell upon Her
					Stomach &amp; early vorlent reachings which occasiond
					Her moveing into the Sickroom from the Grt Girls

					Dureing the short time she was with them
					when in the sickroom it was Soon perceiveable that

					&amp; to retain a true &amp; lively sense of all the Grace bestowd
					upon one Especialy in Such hours &amp; moments when
					the bodily pains pours in beyond all patience, a few
					days before Her departure she askd the Sister If they

					she thought she had nothing on Her Mind, but
					what she had throughly spoke about with Her
					Hearts best freind, but she was answerd by a S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
