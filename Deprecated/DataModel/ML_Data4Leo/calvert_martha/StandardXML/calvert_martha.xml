					<l>The single S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Martha Calvert who</l>
					<l>departed this life March 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1816,</l>
					<l>has left the following short account,</l>
					<l>which she dictated Sept 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1813.</l>
					<l>I was born Oct 19th 1743 in Idle,</l>
					<l>in my 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> year I moved with my</l>
					<l>parents into Pudsey, they belonging</l>
					<l>to the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> as soon as I</l>
					<l>was old enough took me to the </l>
					<l>Childrens meeting, where I remem</l>
					<l>ber as a very little Child being</l>
					<l>told to pray to our Saviour to </l>
					<l>wash our hearts in his blood,</l>
					<l>and when I came home, I </l>
					<l>often went into a corner, and</l>
					<l>repeated these words as well as</l>
					<l>I could. March 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1756 I </l>
					<l>was added to the great Girls Choir,</l>
					<l>which day proved a great blessing</l>
					<l>to me, and from that time I </l>
					<l>felt an earnest desire to come to </l>
					<l>live in Fulnek, this favour was</l>

					<l>granted to me May 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1759. I </l>
					<l>was now very happy and comfort</l>
					<l>able, felt quite at home, and </l>
					<l>thought I wanted nothing more.</l>
					<l>The 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Nov. the same year I</l>
					<l>was rec&apos;d into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> with 26</l>
					<l>others; having made no previous </l>
					<l>application for this favour, I </l>
					<l>was much struck when my name</l>
					<l>was read in the Caple, but I </l>
					<l>prayed fervently to our Saviour</l>
					<l>that his aim might be obtained</l>
					<l>with me. Jan. 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1760 I was </l>
					<l>spectator at the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> from</l>
					<l>this time till the 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Aug.</l>
					<l>the same year, when I had the </l>
					<l>favour to enjoy this sacramental</l>
					<l>food for the first time, was a </l>
					<l>period which I shall never forget,</l>
					<l>when I learned to know my own </l>
					<l>depravity and sinfulness, and our</l>
					<l>Saviour manifested himself to</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
					<p>
				<lg>
					<l>my heart in a particular manner as</l>
					<l>my Redeemer. I learned to know</l>
					<l>that without him I could do nothing,</l>
					<l>which proved a good and holesome</l>
					<l>School to me, and after this I </l>
					<l>went on for sometime in a hap</l>
					<l>py course. In my 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> year, B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></l>
					<l>Nitshman spoke individually with </l>
					<l>our whole Choir, it has always been</l>
					<l>impressed on my mind how fer</l>
					<l>vently he recommended me to our</l>
					<l>Saviour. After the Synod in 1764</l>
					<l>was a very searching time in this </l>
					<l>Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, which was also to me of great</l>
					<l>importance, I sensibly felt how</l>
					<l>short I fell of what I ought to</l>
					<l>be, which humbled me at the Lords</l>
					<l>feet to seek grace and pardon, and </l>
					<l>when the whole Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> had missed</l>
					<l>the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> for 3 successive </l>
					<l>times, the feeling which pervaded</l>
					<l>us all when we again had the</l>

				<lg>
					<l>favour to meet at the Lords table</l>
					<l>words cannot express. To say much</l>
					<l>more concerning my pilgrimage</l>
					<l>here below, I am not able, nor</l>
					<l>has any thing very striking accur</l>
					<l>red, my Saviour has dealt <del>has</del></l>
					<l>with me as a kind and tender</l>
					<l>Father, lead me on by degrees</l>
					<l>as I was able to bear it, and </l>
					<l>kept his faithful hand over me</l>
					<l>in many trying hours of temptation.</l>
					<l>When I therefore now look back</l>
					<l>how I have spent my time, my</l>
					<l>only plea is; &quot;God be merciful to</l>
					<l>me a sinner.&quot; I find abundent</l>
					<l>cause to thank and adore my kind</l>
					<l>Redeemer for all his love and faith</l>
					<l>fulness towards me in every respect;</l>
					<l>in my imply he has blessed me</l>
					<l>that I have wanted for nothing </l>
					<l>and often when I was sweeping</l>
					<l>the Sleeproom, and being with</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>my Saviour alone, I have had many</l>
					<l>happy hours, when I could simply</l>
					<l>lay my case before him. Now</l>
					<l>when I am not able to do any</l>
					<l>thing, the time will now and then</l>
					<l>apear long to me, but I pray</l>
					<l>to him to strenghten my faith and</l>
					<l>confidence, and to prepare me</l>
					<l>for his heavenly kingdom, I am</l>
					<l>very thankful that I am able</l>
					<l>to attend the meetings, which prove</l>
					<l>a great comfort and refreshment</l>
					<l>to my heart.</l>
					<l>Our late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> did not think when </l>
					<l>she dictated this, that she still</l>
					<l>should remain so long in this</l>
					<l>vale of tears, her patience was</l>
					<l>often tried, but she prayed earnest</l>
					<l>ly to the Lord for help and sup</l>
					<l>port; as long <del>as long</del> as she was</l>
					<l>able, she faithfully attended the </l>
					<l>Chaple, where she found food and </l>

					<l>nourishment for her hungry soul</l>
					<l>and with great thankfulness for</l>
					<l>the blessings she now injoyed</l>
					<l>she often lamented, that she in</l>
					<l>former days had not made better</l>
					<l>use of those priviledges, she often</l>
					<l>said, that during her late affiliation</l>
					<l>she was in a close School, where</l>
					<l>our Saviour by his good spirit</l>
					<l>pointed out to how many things,</l>
					<l>which led to deep self examina</l>
					<l>tion; and here she experienced</l>
					<l>now, that he who wounds, can</l>
					<l>also heal the sins with soul, and</l>
					<l>speak pardon and peace to the</l>
					<l>troubled mind, and thanked the</l>
					<l>Lord with many tears, for what</l>
					<l>he had done for her.</l>
					<l>In July last year, she was seized</l>
					<l>with a paralytick strook, whereby</l>
					<l>she was deprived of nearly all</l>
					<l>the use of her limbs, this was</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
					
					<p>

				<lg>
					<l>an other hard trial, but the Lord</l>
					<l>gave her grace to bear this and </l>
					<l>other afflictions with patience, tho&apos; </l>
					<l>she often longed for the time to </l>
					<l>be with him; she would frequently</l>
					<l>say, o what happiness awaits me,</l>
					<l>when I shall see my Saviour face to</l>
					<l>face, O what endless mercy, that he</l>
					<l>will receive such a poor and worth</l>
					<l>sinner as I am. The 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Last.</l>
					<l>she was according to her desire</l>
					<l>blessed for her departure and com</l>
					<l>mended to the friend of her soul,</l>
					<l>and the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> early in the morning</l>
					<l>it pleased our Saviour to call</l>
					<l>her hence, to rest with him for</l>
					<l>ever more. Aged 72 years. 5 Months.</l>
