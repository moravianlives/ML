      <h2>Richard Fenton</h2>
      <p> The Course of Life, of the great Boy<a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000556.html">Rich<sup>d</sup> Fenton</a><br/>who departed<em>Dec. 29
            						1772</em>.</p>
      <p><a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000556.html">Rich<sup>d</sup> Fenton</a>, Son of our Br<a href=".html">Richd Fenton</a> was born 
         <br/>
         the 16<sup>th</sup> of May 1757 at <a href="#mlpla000110.html">Pudsey, in the Parish of Cal-
            <br/>
            verly</a>. As a Child he went to the
         								<a href=".html">B<sup>rns</sup> School</a> at
         							<a href=".html">Lane -<br/> End</a> where he learn'd till
         						he was <em>12 Years old</em>. In <em>June <br/> 1769</em> he was bound Apprentice to B<sup>r</sup><a href=".html">John Spicer</a> <br/> to learn the Glover's Business &amp; came at the
         						same <br/> time to live in the <a href=".html">Choir House</a>, where he
         						went on <sup>in</sup> a <br/>still &amp; quiet Course to the
         						Satisfaction of his Brn <br/> In the following Year he
         							began to be sickly, &amp; as all <br/>
         						endeavours for his recovery proved ineffectual, he
         							grew <br/> weaker &amp; weaker from time to time &amp; as his
         						Parents <br/> lived near, it was propos'd to him to go and live with
         						them, <br/> whereby he might enjoy more of their Parental Care &amp; <br/>
         						Nursing; but he declin'd it. However as he grew more <br/> helpless, he, in
         						the <em>beginning of last July</em>, agreed to go <br/>
         						&amp; be with his Parents, where he has enjoyed a happy <br/> &amp;
         						sabbatical time waiting with Patience and Resig <br/>
         - nation when it would please our Saviour to take him 
         <br/>
         into his eternal Joy &amp; Security. He was now &amp; then <br/> visited by
         						the B<sup>rn</sup> to whom he declared
         						that altho' <br/> he was resigned to our Sav<sup>r</sup> yet he knew that it would <br/>
         						be better for him to be with <a href=".html">Christ</a>, than
         						to recover </p>
   	
   	
   	
   	
      <p> his Health, &amp; live here still longer. He had an Im-
         <br/>
         pression of our Saviour's love towards him, which
         						made <br/> him look &amp; pray to our Saviour with Confidence. <br/> When he was visited by
         								B<sup>rn</sup> whom he was
         						accquainted with, <br/> he desired that they might sign sing some Verses <br/> with him,
         						&amp; several Times he mentioned in particular that <br/> the following should be
         						sung: I am a poor Sinner, yes <br/> 'tis true I am &amp;c. He came here to the
         						Meetings as long <br/> as he was able to walk, or ride, which always seem'd <br/> to be
         						a refreshment to him, &amp; when he was no more able <br/> to come to the
         						meetings, he was <sup>very</sup> Sorry for it, especially <br/> when
         						he thought that he should not have the pleasure<br/> to attend the meetings on
         							Christmas Eve, on which <br/> account he propos'd
         						that a couple of B<sup>rn</sup> should
         						carry <br/> him to the <a href=".html">Hall</a> in a Sedan; But on the <em>19<sup>th</sup> of Dec<sup>r</sup><br/></em> in the Night, he had such a gracious visit of our
         <br/>Sav<sup>r</sup> that he became quite satisfied, with his not <br/>
         						being able to come to the meetings on <em>Christmas Eve</em>, <br/> for when
         						he got up in the Morning &amp; dressed himself <br/> he began to speak to his
         						Mother about it &amp; told her there <br/> had happened an alteration with him
         						last Night <br/> when she asked what way, he told her that our Sav<sup>r</sup></p>
      <p> had been very <sup>near</sup> to him &amp; he had kept a band
         						with him <br/> about every thing, &amp; our Sav<sup>r</sup> had forgiven him all &amp; <br/>
         						would take him soon to himself. He also said: "I gave
         <br/>
         myself quite anew to
         						our Saviour, &amp; he accepted me as <br/>
         						his own Child, Believing his time would be short, he <br/>desired that his
         							Srs in the <a href=".html">Choir
            							House</a> might be <br/> sent for, to tell them how happy our
         							Saviour had <br/> made him, &amp; that
         						he would soon take him to himself <br/> to be happy &amp; to live with him
         						forever. Since this <br/> time he grew weaker so
         							fast, that one could see the <br/> time of his Departure came on very
         						quickly. Some <br/> Days before his going home, his Master came to <br/> see him, &amp;
         						when he was going to leave him, he reached <br/> his hand to his Master &amp;
         						thanked him for all the <br/>love &amp; favours he had shewn to him, telling him: <br/>
         						he very likely might never see him any more in this <br/> World, &amp; so it came
         						to pass, for on <em>Decr 29<sup>th</sup>, 1772</em><br/> in the Morning his Soul took its Flight, to that <br/> God, who had created &amp; redeemed him &amp; made him <br/>so happy by his precious Nearness, in the 16<sup>th</sup><br/>
         						Year of his Age. </p></body>
