The Cour of Life of the Single Sister Anna Shoesmith
I was born  NorthernGreen in the parish of Halifax Augst 13 1752 and
Baptz by Brn in the year 1758 I removed with my parents to
Fulneck, I of uncommon Light turn of mind caused much
dissatisfaction to my dear parents dureing the course of years spent wth
them and also deprived my self of many priviledges amongest
the Children which might aprove'd about blessing to my own 
Heart and a comfort & joy to those about me; but my bad conduct soon overcame
me Especial if my parents forebore there reprove my trouble was presumably
at an End. Thus I spent my time March 1764 when I was took into the
Great Girls Choir from which time I begd my parents to get me leave to
live in the choirhouse they told me many circumstances of my unfitness
& desired me to intreat our Savr for Grace & solidness of Heart to get more
deeply Ground in the knowledg of My self and want of Him. this made.
a real impression for a Time upon me & caused me to turn to our Savr to beg him
in my prayers to allow & prepare my heart to be more to his mind in all my
ways, and on overhearing my parent saying to Each other that
I had leave to live in the choirhouse the rejoiced me very much &
made me turn with Earnestness of Heart to our dr Savr to preserve and keep
me to the End of all my Days & in a fortnight Time I had the Grace to
remove into the choirhouse & continued for some time chereful & happy
but this injoyment lasted not long, for I became dry & indifferent to
every thing that was Good and ordorly for a Child of God one in my Situation &
great unEaseyness of Heart was My daily course Esspecialy on seeing
first one & then another of my room companions made partakers of the
congregation My perplexations increased & my hearts distress
was quite unbearable but this Lasted not long for I took my own
means & method to make of bearable by thinking lightly & indiffrent over
every thing that was a blessing to a Child of God, yet amidst all this 


unhappy condition my Gracious Savr kept his hand upon me and 
drew me as with Cords of Love so that I cou'd no longer withhold
my heart from his love & mercy & felt Liberty to out my
woes & wants with a Thousand Tears, conf found him
whom My soul so much wanted in this & meltedness
of Heart my Savr blest & comfortd me as his pardond one & I became his
poor needy & dependant Creature, & by the first opertunity I pourd
out my heart into my Labourer who begd me to keep close to
to our Savr as his & often keep band with him over all
my wants & I might be sure of having a Happy course during
all future years. July 17th 1768 I had the Grace to be receivd into the
congregation, which rejoicd me very much but my body and
Light turn of mind deprived me of making the best use of the solid
council & advice given by the Sisters to me & cou'd rather be drawn
to follow those of my own turn of mind then otherwise be perswaded
to seek for Solidness & stability of heart, this fare her own dictating
in The Year 1772 our happily departed Sister was received into the
Single Sisters Choir this made a change for some little Time & she
was moved into a Sisters Room but it was presently perceptible
that Her course & companions therein was of an unprofitable
& painful Consequence yet nothing could preswade Her from it
beleaving all friendship suffering herself to be thus insnar'd
Soul of its maker nurture from affection to
She & deprived her Heart of the only schooling of the H Spirit
& in this infatuation of pretended friendship she spent Her
Latter years & a weakly habbit of body brought on a perceptible
decline of Strengths so that in the beginning of the
year 72 she was obliged to remove into the sick room where
a more real sence of her Hearts situation became more Her
object of concern and our dr Savr in Mercie vouchsafeth her
many gracious visits & she has his needy one turnd to him
with Heart & soul inamourd with His Mercies she Earnestly


sought for Grace as a needy Sinner & bore her weakly Tabernacle
with Great patience its apointed Times on the first of July
she injoyed the Holy communion in the Sickroom with a melted & Sinnerlike
dispossion she was a  little better she also participated with the
congregation on the 11th of the same month with a Thankful & comforted Heart
& Thus continued in a happy Expectation of her souls bridegroom
fetching Her to His arms & bosom. the Consumation of
all her desires was blessedly compleatd Early on the morning
of the 3d of August & in the 20 years of her age.
