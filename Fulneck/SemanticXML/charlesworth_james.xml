					<p> I was born at <placeName>Little Gummersal</placeName> in the parish of <placeName ref="#mlpla000030">Birstal</placeName> in the County of <placeName>York</placeName> on the

							<hi rend="underline">people</hi>
						<add place="above">youths</add> are expos&apos;d to. When at the Age of 12 to 14 Years I began to keep company &amp; frequent some of the places of Diversions in the World; I
						never <hi rend="superscript">ed</hi> do it with the same ease &amp; Satisfaction w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I saw other people did, but always felt Remorse of Conscience,
						&amp; when I was alone often pray&apos;d to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> to have Mercy upon me &amp; keep &amp; preserve me from
						all Sin. At ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> the <date when-iso="1736" cert="medium">age of 15</date>, I left off all Pleasures &amp; became acquainted with a small

					<p> In the year <date when-iso="1755">1755</date> when the place Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> was Settled, He was appointed to be the <name office="warden">Vorsteher (or

					<p> From the very beginning of the Settlement here, He was particularly engag&apos;d in every undertaking &amp; till the year <date when-iso="1763">1763</date>, all the external
						Affairs of this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> relating to the Settlement viz the Administration of the Estate &amp; Buildings, were in his Hands. In this Situation he had
						many difficulties to struggle with, &amp; felt often the Lord that was upon him with much concern. From the year 1755, he was not only employed in the External affairs, but He
						&amp; His dear wife assisted in the Internal Labour. <add place="above">In 1754 He was ordain&apos;d a</add>

					<p> In June 1756, he with his wife went to the Synod at Berthelsdorf Tho&apos; he was chiefly to the Service of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi> in Yorkshire, yet he was also

						Service, he remain&apos;d active in all those matters.</p>

					<p> a member thereof &amp; continued as such till that Con<hi rend="superscript">fer</hi> ceas&apos;d in the year 1769. Tho&apos; his Talents in the Conducting the external <add

						also wish&apos;d to be rather employ&apos;d in the Internal Labour, &amp; often express&apos;d his desire to be freed from all his External engagements. In consequence of this
						his repeated Request, He was Released in 1763 from being immediately active in the Manufacture, tho&apos; he remain&apos;d the Counsellor in it till the year 1766; when it came
						into another Channel.</p>
					<p> Being Proprietor of the Estate, He frequently attended the Meetings of the Parish for conducting the Town&apos;s Busyness, &amp; by his prudent advice He gain&apos;d the esteem
						of the acting persons in the Parish &amp; was of Service in this point of view to the Settlement.</p>
					<p> He went as Deputy of this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> to the Gen Synods at Marienborn in 1764 &amp; last Year, &amp; returned from the last very infirm, tho&apos; his
						disorder w&apos;d not permit him to go much about, yet he assisted in the Labour in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; from this time, the publick Testimony of our
						Savr &amp; his Suffrings &amp; the Discourses w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he Deliver&apos;d to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; Choirs were particularly
						Anointed, &amp; being delivered with warmth of heart were attended with Blessing. So that some B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> made for thence the Remark that they believed he
							wo<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not stay long in the Church below for he was preparing for the Church above. It was also observ&apos;d in his Discourses &amp; Conversation,
						the apprehensions He had of the dangerouse principle of Free thinking &amp; acting w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> had erept in amongst us, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>
						might be more hurtful to our Constitution, than any other difficulty we were sensible of</p>
					<p> He had for many years past frequent Sicknesses, &amp; having a great portion of sensibility, when matters did not go well &amp; contrary to his hopes, his Body felt the effects

					<p> inward Grief prey&apos;d upon him, of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he was sensible &amp; wo<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>speak of at times with concern. All this seem&apos;d

						prepar&apos;d to leave this Body, &amp; to enter into the presence of his Lord.</p>
					<p> Last spring He had a very severe attack of the stone Cholick of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> He Recovr&apos;d so as to be active in his Office, yet the Effects were Visible.
						He had a second fitt of sickness with an Inflamation in his Face &amp; a violent pain in his Head by w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he was confin&apos;d to his Room ab<hi
							rend="superscript">t</hi> a fortnight, but was again so well Recover&apos;d as to go about, but his Constitution was apparently weaken&apos;d w<hi rend="superscript"
							>ch</hi> rais&apos;d the apprehensions of his going home of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he spoke frequent- ly with desire. He preached on the 15<hi rend="superscript"

						the Hall was a Discourse to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> for the Conclusion of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Day on the

						&amp; the whole; this has prov&apos;d his Valedictory discourse &amp; prayer for this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; the work of the Lord in general. He soon after had
						a Boil w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> gathered on his Shoulder &amp; was attended with much pain &amp; inflam&apos;d his Back w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> threw him into a
						Bilious Fever. Even during his sickness he shew&apos;d his wonted paternal heart in Counsel &amp; Friedship to those who came to him, as long as he had strength to speak. He
						was tender &amp; loving to all, saying once &quot;I have nothing against any one &amp; hope no one has any thing against me. <note type="catchword">we</note>
