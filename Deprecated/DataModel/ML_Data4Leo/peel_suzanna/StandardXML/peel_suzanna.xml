					<l>to Tyrsal-hall, were She became more Acquainte </l>
					<l>with our Saviour, She was a Chearfull and happy</l>
					<l>heart, her Disposishon was Childlike an honest</l>
					<l>which made her belvoed by all the Sisters, who had</l>

					<l>and intension was; to be a plesuer to his heart, Who</l>
					<l>had Shed his blood for her; when the Sisters removed</l>
					<l>out of the EOconemys, into the Choir-house, She had</l>
					<l>the faviour to be one of them, and thought her Self</l>
					<l>highly faviourd, that She had aplase among that Choir</l>
					<l>Which our Saviour him Self has brought to gether, to be</l>
					<l>an Honer to his Name, and a reward for all his Smart</l>

					<l>She however remaind very patien under it and</l>
					<l>Complaind very Little, She often Longd to be</l>
					<l>at home with our Saviour, for She Said that her</l>
					<l>Disorder was of Such a natuer, that She was</l>
					<l>Likely to be very troblesom to the Sisters, which</l>
					<l>was some pain to her, but her Chearfulness of</l>

					<l>it was a great adishon to her joy, that her</l>
					<l>Bridegroom and Lover had ownd an such a</l>
					<l>manner, tho She according to her thoughts was</l>
					<l>one of the meenest and has meny times since Said</l>
					<l>that in all her Life She Could not forget, and</l>
					<l>when She Shou&apos;d once get the faviour to see</l>
