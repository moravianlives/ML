            					<br></br>Our late dr Br. James Charlesworth has left the following short account
            					<br></br>of some of the most remarkable particular Circumstances of his Life till
            					<br></br>to the year 1753.</p>
         <p><br></br>I was born at Little Gummersal in the parish of Birstal in the 
            					<br></br>County of York on the 16<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> Dec<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> 1721. And was Educated by my Parents in

            					<br></br>from the Seductions w<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ch</sup> many peopleyouths are expos'd to. When at the Age of
            					<br></br>12 to 14 Years I began to keep company &amp; frequent some of the places
            					<br></br>of Diversions in the World; I never <sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ed</sup> do it with the same ease &amp;
            					<br></br>Satisfaction w<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ch</sup> I saw other people did, but always felt Remorse of
            					<br></br>Conscience, &amp; when I was alone often pray'd to our Sav<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> to have Mercy

            					<br></br>to whom I join'd my Self, Read their Books &amp; became very sober &amp;
            					<br></br>Religious, but found my poor heart wanted something w<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ch</sup> I had not.</p>

            					<br></br>&amp; as such a poor Sinner. I fled for Refuge to his wounds &amp; found peace
            					<br></br>thro' the Virtue &amp; power of his merits &amp; Death. In the year 1740 I went

         <p><br></br> In the year 1755 when the place Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> was Settled, He was

         <p><br></br>From the very beginning of the Settlement here, He was particularly
            					<br></br>engag'd in every undertaking &amp; till the year 1763, all the external

            					<br></br>of the Estate &amp; Buildings, were in his Hands. In this Situation
            					<br></br>he had many difficulties to struggle with, &amp; felt often the Lord that
            					<br></br>was upon him with much concern. From the year 1755, he was
            					<br></br>not only employed in the External affairs, but He &amp; His dear wife
            					<br></br>assisted in the Internal Labour. In 1754 He was ordain'd a<br></br>Deacon of the B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn's</sup> Church</p>
         <p><br></br>In June 1756, he with his wife went to the Synod at Berthelsdorf
            					<br></br>Tho' he was chiefly to the Service of the Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ns</sup> in Yorkshire, yet he was

            					<br></br>of the Unity &amp; our Lord having bestow'd upon him particular Gifts &amp; Grace
            					<br></br>to his Service, he remain'd active in all those matters.</p>
         <p><br></br>In the Year 1757 he was appointed to be one of the Board of
            					<br></br>Administation of the Affairs of the Unity in England, &amp; was usefull

            					<br></br>employ'd in that way, yet he also wish'd to be rather employ'd in 
            					<br></br>the Internal Labour, &amp; often express'd his desire to be freed from all
            					<br></br>his External engagements. In consequence of this his repeated
            					<br></br>Request, He was Released in 1763 from being immediately active
            					<br></br>in the Manufacture, tho' he remain'd the Counsellor in it till the
            					<br></br>year 1766; when it came into another Channel.</p>
         <p><br></br>Being Proprietor of the Estate, He frequently attended the Meetings
            					<br></br>of the Parish for conducting the Town's Busyness, &amp; by his prudent
            					<br></br>advice He gain'd the esteem of the acting persons in the Parish &amp;
            					<br></br>was of Service in this point of view to the Settlement.</p>
         <p><br></br>He went as Deputy of this Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> to the Gen Synods at Marienborn
