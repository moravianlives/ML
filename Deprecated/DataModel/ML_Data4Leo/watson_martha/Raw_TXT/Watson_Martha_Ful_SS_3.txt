The S Sr Martha Watson who departed 
this life June 21st 1810. was born July, 11.
the	
1743 in Pudsey & bap. in Presbitirian
Church. As a Child she came often errands
to Fulnek & used to say she would like
to live here, but her Father being not
inclined towards the Brns Congn she
met with no incouragement, when she
was 15 years her father departed this
this life, & she was now obliged to go 
to service, she went to several places
and at last to Hallifax, where she
met with a very good Mrs, still
it always dwelt on her mind, & she
felt a Call in her heart to the Brn
Congn not being able to withstand
it any longer she made application
and March 12th 1772 she obtained
leave to live in the Srs House at 
Gumersal, she stayed here a little above
a year, and was then removed to Ful
nek and placed in the School Kitshen
as to have management of it.
Oct 6th 1773 she was rec'd into the 
Congn and Nov 9th 1776 she partook


the first line of the H Comn, She
often used to relate that this period
from her receiption till she had the
favour to injoy the H Comn was the 
most remarkable in her life, it was
the time when she learned to know
herself, and as a poor undone Sinner
Saviors
found grace in our sight. 
In the before mentioned sitiation she
served 29 years with great faithful
ness on which account she was respected,
she had many difficulties to struggle
it
with, and had very hard in the be
ginning, but she looked to our Saviour
for help, and often expressed her gratitude
for what he had done for her. 
Being rather of a selfrighteous turn
& not the best temper, it was at times
troublesome for those who where con
nected with her, but knowing her
intentions were good, every allowence
were made. In 1802 she came to live
in the Srs House here, being troubled
with the Rheumatism; and feeling her
self not able to continue in her
past, this was however a great trial


to her, being used to an actife life, she
could not compose mind to have 
to do
an 
nothing besides she felt such atach
ment to her School & the Children, that
she hartly ever got over it, we had
often to shear & comfort her on that 
account. The few years she spent in
in our house she was very weak & 
infirm, in spring 1809 it appeared 
as if she was going in a decline,
but she recovered a little again, & it
since
terminated in a dropsy, from the
beginning of this year she labored
under much pain & sufferings, some
long 
times the time would appear to
her before our Saviour would release
her, but upon the whole she bore
her pains with patience &
resignation to our Saviours will,
to him 
& prayed often to claanee her in
his precious blood form every stain,
that she may as a pardoned sinner
appear him. This favour was granted
to her June 21, when she happily
fell asleep in Jesus. Aged nearly 
67 years.
