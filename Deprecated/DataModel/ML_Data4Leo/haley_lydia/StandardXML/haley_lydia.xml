					<l>As to her Disposichion, She was very Close &amp;</l>
					<l>always kept her matters quite to her<add place="above">self</add> Speaking of</l>
					<l>them to no one exept ye S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Who had ye Care of ye</l>
					<l>Oconemy, by which Means She Lost that right enjoy</l>
					<l>ment and fellowship, which She might have injoyed,</l>
					<l>had She been more free &amp; Open hearted, however</l>
					<l>our dear Saviour had a faithfull Eye over her, and </l>
					<l>often Came near her heart to see when he Coud reach</l>
					<l>his time with her in makeing her intier</l>
					<l>so <add rend="above">he</add> Led her from step to Step, just as a tender Nurse</l>
					<l>Cares for her Child</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>On ye 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of August 1751 She became a Candidate</l>
					<l>for ye Sacrament, When ye S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Removed into ye</l>
					<l>Choir hous She Came along with them, and has ever</l>
					<l>since been very Sickley, so that <add place="above">it</add> has often been thought </l>
					<l>She Woud go home, tho it was never Clear to</l>
					<l>her, for She aways thought of recovering again </l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>Dec<hi rend="superscript">ber</hi> ye 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 53 She was Confirmed</l>
					<l>and, on Jan<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> ye 16 She for firsd time partkook of ye</l>
					<l>holy Sacrament for which She had Long&apos;d very </l>
					<l>much, it proved a Lasting blessing to her, tho</l>
					<l>She never expressd much in Words, yet ye desier</l>
					<l>of her heart after his Marter&apos;d Corpess by Each</l>
					<l>enjoyment was very perseptable</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>At ye Conclution of this Year when She was spoke</l>
					<l>with <add place="above">for</add> ye Sacrament, She expressd her Self in Sick a perti-</l>
					<l>cular <add place="above">manner</add> Concerning her heart as She never had done before</l>
					<l>O Said She I know and feel very, for why our</l>
					<l>Saviour permits me to Suffer so much in this body</l>
					<l>it is becose he means it well with me, had I my</l>
					<l>Healt and was well, very Likely I shoud have not</l>
					<l>remaind in that Conextion, with him and his Congre</l>
					<l>gation</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>At this ye facstion was put to her; why not as well</l>
					<l>in <hi rend="strikethrough">Sickness</hi> health as in Sickness? then Said She nobody</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>nobody Knows what I feel &amp; ye Grife I have</l>
					<l>Concorneing my Br When I see the Steps, he has</l>
					<l>taken; this Gave her deep Concorne, and made her</l>
					<l>Shed many tears, so that She Coud Scarcely</l>
					<l>be pacefied</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>She has within this half Year been much better</l>
					<l>in health, then She has been for some time, She</l>

					<l>more such great pain in her Limb as a foretimes</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>June ye 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> She Spoke with much tenderness what</l>
					<l>our dear Saviour had done for her Since She</l>
					<l>had been in ye Congregation, what Love and</l>
					<l>faithfullness he had shewn to her, in perticuler</l>
					<l>that he had made he a pertaker of his Corpes</l>
					<l>&amp; Blood in ye holy Sacrament, for which She</l>
					<l>again felt a great Loning and desier, to be again</l>
					<l>a New refrechd on her dear and Marterd</l>
					<l>Spouse, which She again enjoid on ye 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of</l>

					<p><lg>
					<l>The day following She felt great pains Comeing</l>
					<l>on her again, which Continued to grow worse &amp;</l>
					<l>worse, we sent for brother Planta, he made use</l>
					<l>of all means passable, as he hath always done for</l>
					<l>this several years past, She for a little Wile</l>
					<l>found Ease, but her Disorder being of such a</l>
					<l>Nature that <add place="above">all</add> Mean which Coud be found proved </l>
					<l>inafectual</l></lg></p>
