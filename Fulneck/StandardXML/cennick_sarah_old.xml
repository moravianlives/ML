							<l><hi rend="underline">The Life of the S. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sarah Cennick who went happily home Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 24<hi rend="superscript"
										>th</hi> 1770</hi></l>
							<l>I was born June the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> old Style 1712 in Reading Berks. </l>
							<l>wass baptiz&apos;d in the Church of England and brought up in that <choice>
									<orig>Comunion</orig>
									<reg>Communion</reg>
								</choice>.</l>
							<l>The first thing I remember is the simple and happy intercourse I </l>
							<l>lived in with the Lord: I knew he lov&apos;d me; and I lov &apos;d him; &amp; therefore</l>
							<l>used to have recourse to Him without the least reserve.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>When I was about 5 Years old, I remember to have been particularly</l>
							<l>naughty &amp; selfwilld, which caused me much heaviness, tho&apos; I strove all</l>
							<l>I could to divert and get rid of the Conviction by play &amp;c. But</l>
							<l>running hastily into my Mothers room, where she was sitting with</l>
							<l>my late d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John - then an Infant - lying in her lap.</l>
							<l>I saw her weeping with lifted up hands, and heard her pray. I was</l>
							<l>much affected: But felt so hard, to acknowledge my fault, but</l>
							<l>upon repeatedly asking my Mother, why she cried and what she</l>
							<l>was saying? She referr&apos;d the Cause to me and Said: &quot;I was praying</l>
							<l>for <hi rend="underline">you</hi> and for your Brother.&quot; This pierc&apos;d me through, and I</l>
							<l>thought my heart would break. For I thought, The Lord also is</l>
							<l><choice>
									<orig>greived</orig>
									<reg>grieved</reg>
								</choice>! I therefore silently withdrew condemn&apos;d and asham&apos;d</l>
							<l>and hasted to a private Place, where with many Tears, I <choice>
									<orig>beged</orig>
									<reg>begged</reg>
								</choice></l>
							<l>Him to forgive me; which he most graciously did directly, and</l>
							<l>all my Burthen instantly removed.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>My Father and his Relations being all Quakers of the</l>
							<l>most primitive sort, and my Mother and hers all strict Church</l>
							<l>of England; Her attachment to, and chief acquaintance were the</l>
							<l>Clergy; So that I had the <choice>
									<orig>Oppertunity</orig>
									<reg>Opportunity</reg>
								</choice> of an intimate familiarity</l>
							<l>with <add place="above">each</add>, not perceiving, at this time, the least disunion on either Side.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Our Parish Vicar and his Family was a part of our</l>
							<l>most intimate acquaintance, and his Daughter, who had taken</l>
							<l>a liking to me from my Infancy, calling me her own Child,</l>
							<l>at last prevailed with my Parents, to take me more particularly</l>
							<l>home to her; But our houses Joining each other, I was nearly</l>
							<l>as much with my Parents as I was with them. This lady,</l>
							<l>taking me, to a friends house with her, I <choice>
									<orig>slip&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>slipped</reg>
								</choice> out from</l>
							<l>the Company, and saw two small Boats fastened to the</l>
							<l>Landing Place in a deep Moat, I got into one of them</l>
							<l>and reached out of it to the Side of the other Boat:</l>
							<l>when both parting, and <choice>
									<orig>swiming</orig>
									<reg>swimming</reg>
								</choice> from each other</l>
							<l>had dragged me out of that I stood in, had not the toes</l>
							<l>of my shoes <choice>
									<orig>hitch&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>hitched</reg>
								</choice> in something, and prevented it:</l>
							<l>Thus hanging over the Water between both, I had</l>
							<l>scarce time to give my self up for lost, Before I <choice>
									<orig>Slip&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>slipped</reg>
								</choice></l>
							<l>my hold and pitched into the Water, where to my <choice>
									<orig>Joyfull</orig>

							<l>bearing so strong against my hands as to get and keep my head above</l>
							<l>water. Yea those kind Assistants bore me up so long, even till I was</l>
							<l>capable of taking hold with one Hand of that Boat, wherein, all </l>

							<l>whose kinder Orders they <choice>
									<orig>Obey&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>obeyed</reg>
								</choice>, and thanked them, and Him,</l>
							<l>Friend: beging Him 100 times over: O pray don&apos;t let it be found</l>

							<l>I was this Gentlemans* <add place="margin">The parish vicar</add> fond Companion also, and often<note>In the memoir, the phrase "the parish vicar" is written in pencil

								</choice> to private Devotion</l>
							<l>sometimes I kneel&apos;d behind, and at other times close by his side,</l>

							<l>he <choice>
									<orig>enjoy&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>enjoyed</reg>
								</choice>.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>As I Grew older, I had more liberty among the Servants,</l>
							<l>who <choice>
									<orig>endeavour&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>endeavoured</reg>
								</choice> to seduce me and bring me into all manner of</l>
							<l>Wickedness, as much as they could, But finding me <choice>
									<orig>frighten&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>frightened</reg>
								</choice>,</l>
							<l>and fearing I should tell, they <choice>
									<orig>threaten&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>threatened</reg>
								</choice> me hard, what they</l>
							<l>would do to me, if I did. This brought me more particularly to my</l>
							<l>own Hearts Friend, and they let me alone for sometime; till one</l>
							<l>evening, I went into a back Garden, where a Company of them wo</l>
							<l>got, but I did not know nor think of them, till I was almost</l>
							<l><choice>
									<orig>shock&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>shocked</reg>
								</choice> to death, and could scarce stagger into <add place="above">the House</add>
								<hi rend="strikethrough">door</hi>, when, even in</l>
							<l>the very Passage, the Lord met me, Comforted me, and gave me</l>
							<l>the Assurance in my Heart, &quot;He would preserve me for himself</l>
							<l>for ever.&quot; This Promise has always been a secret Comfort to me,</l>
							<l>all my Course through, yea even, when in the highest of my Folly</l>
							<l>in the World. I was near 8 years old, &amp; made a memorandum of that</l>
							<l>important Day. I was kept more close to my learning, and was</l>
							<l>instructed in all the Principles of the Church. I also got Courage</l>
							<l>to discover those notorious deceivers, without their knowing it was me</l>
							<l>Yet my Heart departed from its dearest Object, and I became as</l>
							<l>Formal and vain as any Body; I saw myself a fair Candidate</l>
							<l>for the World; but also, Ruin, Destruction, and eternal death</l>
							<l>stood as fair before me. This made me go on heavily, but I could</l>
							<l>tell no one: And as I was under Preparation for the <choice>
									<orig>H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orig>
									<reg>Holy Communion</reg>
								</choice></l>
							<l>I was the more <choice>
									<orig>distress&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>distressed</reg>
								</choice>; Sometimes in dispair and sometimes</l>
							<l>desperate. In this Situation I went to Evening Prayers, but I</l>
							<l>could neither pray, nor desire. I was so <choice>
									<orig>condemn&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>condemned</reg>
								</choice>; But in the</l>
							<l><choice>
									<orig>Begining</orig>
									<reg>beginning</reg>
								</choice> of the last Prayers, my Heart became as melting Wax,</l>
							<l>and as such a Wretch I <choice>
									<orig>turn&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>turned</reg>
								</choice> again to my Friend, and begg&apos;d for mercy </l>
							<l>and got Confidence to trust and rely on him. I had sometime before</l>
							<l>privately made it out in my own mind, that, as <choice>
									<orig>Oppertunity</orig>
									<reg>opportunity</reg>
								</choice> should</l>
							<l>serve, I would privately retire to a Cloister, and in that <choice>
									<orig>especiall</orig>

							<l>In my 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year it was thought proper by my Friends, that I should</l>
							<l>go to London for further Improvement. I was <choice>
									<orig>receiv&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>received</reg>
								</choice> with the</l>
							<l>greatest heartiness, and every one was kindly officious in bringing </l>
							<l>me to public Places, and shewing me the Curiosities of the Town. I</l>
							<l>saw the <choice>
									<orig>Glory&apos;s</orig>
									<reg>glories</reg>
								</choice> of the World - and loved it - and concluded, as I had</l>
							<l>often been told, I was made for the World, for it suited my Inclination</l>
							<l>and <choice>
									<orig>tast</orig>
									<reg>taste</reg>
								</choice> every way; And I had well nigh set through all Convictions,</l>
							<l>Though at the Bottom I had a <choice>
									<orig>Condemn&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>condemned</reg>
								</choice> heart and guilty Conscience.</l>
							<l>My Mother being in London at this time took me with her, to see a</l>
							<l>Friend of hers in Bedlam, and surveying the many Shocking objects</l>
							<l>there, she tumed to me and said. &quot;This is the <add place="above">sad</add> effect of Love and Pride.&quot;</l>
							<l>I made her no <choice>
									<orig>answere</orig>
									<reg>answer</reg>
								</choice>; but <choice>
									<orig>dispairingly</orig>
									<reg>despairingly</reg>
								</choice> thought: and this will</l>
							<l>one day be my unhappy Case unless God exert his Almighty</l>
							<l>Power in rescuing me. </l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>I soon followed my Mother privately to Reading, giving all my</l>
							<l>Acquaintance the Slip; But was soon surrounded with my old</l>
							<l>Friends and Acquaintance who were very desireous to hear news, and</l>
							<l>learn more particularly the Fashions of the Town. I told them, I was</l>
							<l>quite tired of all those things, and therefore <choice>
									<orig>resolv&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>resolved</reg>
								</choice> soon to retire from</l>
							<l>all, and come and live in a quite different way: If any of them <choice>
									<orig>w<hi rend="strikethrough">h</hi>ere</orig>
									<reg>were</reg>
								</choice></l>
							<l><choice>
									<orig>inclin&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>inclined</reg>
								</choice> to make one of the Company, when I came to settle at home,</l>
							<l>it could be made out.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>From this time I had no rest for my poor distresst Heart &amp; mind</l>
							<l>Therefore in my 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> year I left London the Last time, to put in practice</l>
							<l>what I had so long purposed, renewing my Acquaintance with the</l>
							<l>most solid and religious Part of my Friends. I followed as near</l>
							<l>as I could. Step for step, with my Mother &amp; Brother, who had</l>
							<l>begun some time ago a more religious Course of Life; But, alas!</l>
							<l>I grew faint hearted and <choice>
									<orig>tir&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>tired</reg>
								</choice>: And seeing all my Works, Prayers</l>
							<l>and Duties, good for nothing at all, and I myself that same de-</l>
							<l>plorable Creature as ever I was, I <choice>
									<orig>cry&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>cried</reg>
								</choice> out in the Bitterness of</l>
							<l>my Soul: O Lord Jesus Christ&apos; if this is the way to Heaven, I shall</l>
							<l>never come there! My distress still increased, being more &amp; more</l>
							<l>Sensible of my Degeneracy; But above all did my base ingratitude</l>
							<l>to my once so tender Lover fill me with horror and Dejection. </l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>We had heard of the Awakening in Oxford, where my <choice>
									<orig>B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></orig>
									<reg>brother</reg>
								</choice> went,</l>
							<l>got acquainted with several, and brought M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Kinchin<hi rend="strikethrough">g</hi> to our house;</l>
							<l>and afterwards M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wesleys, Hutchins, Whitfield &amp;c. I was much</l>
							<l><choice>
									<orig>perplex&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>perplexed</reg>
								</choice> in my own mind at this rash (as I thought then) proceeding</l>
							<l>of my Brothers, fearing a Schism in the Church. But being convinced</l>
							<l>of the truth of their Doctrine, was soon Zealously attached thereto.</l>
							<l>But the Preaching being in our House, it made a great stir in the</l>
							<l>Town, and caused us much Trouble and disgrace; So that my Mother</l>
							<l>hearing of it in London, came home, and put an intire Stop to it.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Hereupon my Brother went to <choice>
									<orig>Bristoll</orig>
									<reg>Bristol</reg>
								</choice>, and I, and a well disposed singled</l>
							<l>Woman took a house in the Town; but the Preaching was given up.</l>
							<l>By these means got the ill Will of all my Friends and Relations</l>
							<l>My Acquaintance also <choice>
									<orig>shun&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>shunned</reg>
								</choice> me, and every one&apos;s Face was set against</l>
							<l>me. Thus forsaken of all, and destitute of my best Friend, I grew</l>
							<l>dejected, and quite malancholy.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>In 1740 I visited Kingswood and Bristol; but could not be <choice>
									<orig>reconcil&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>reconciled</reg>
								</choice></l>
							<l>to those Agitations among the Methodists at that time. Here I had</l>
							<l>happiness of seeing first our <choice>
									<orig>d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></orig>
									<reg>dear</reg>
								</choice> Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Toellshig, who seeing my concern,</l>
							<l><choice>
									<orig>help&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>helped</reg>
								</choice> me much. I soon <choice>
									<orig>return&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>returned</reg>
								</choice> to Reading exceedingly <choice>
									<orig>distress&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>distressed</reg>
								</choice>,</l>
							<l>And finding my dear Companion so happy in our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and myself</l>
							<l>so wretched, I gave up all hopes of ever being <choice>
									<orig>sav&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>saved</reg>
								</choice>. But here in</l>
							<l>one moment did my most gracious Saviour reveal Himself to me,</l>
							<l>forgave me all my sin, and in an instant I was <choice>
									<orig>dispossess&apos;d</orig>
									<reg>dispossessed</reg>
								</choice> of every</l>
							<l>Pain: I could hardly tell if I was in the Body or not. For my heart</l>
							<l>saw nothing but Jesus. I felt after Sin; but behold! there was</l>
							<l>no Sin. I felt after my own guilt and Distress, but there was</l>
							<l>no Place found for them, and nothing but light surrounded me. </l>
							<l>I had not <choice>
									<reg>enjoy&apos;d</reg>
									<reg>enjoyed</reg>
								</choice> this happiness long, before my venerable Companion</l>
							<l>fell happily asleep on the Bosom of her eternal Bridegroom.</l>

							<l>I had heard of the Order among the Single Sisters, and that it was</l>

								</choice> once</l>
							<l>to see such a Choir. My Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had already contracted a large Acquaintance</l>

							<l>and she spoke to me in the most Comfortable and encouraging manner,</l>

							<l>The 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I was brought to Annenhoff, where I enjoy&apos;d many inexpressible</l>

							<l>Here I had the favour of Staying till the Close thereof, a time,</l>
							<l>I shall never forget. July the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I set out from Zeist with the</l>

							<l>from several Parts, there being only two Natives. As to outward</l>

							<l>We arrived at Fulneck ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Noon on the 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> and met with a</l>

							<l>till the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Jan; when I was brought to Gumersall Oeconomy be</l>
							<l>S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary and Ann Birkby. I felt well as soon as I enterd the</l>
							<l>House. Early the next morning the <add place="above">two</add> above mentioned Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></l>
							<l>took their leave of us. I got alone into my little room and</l>
							<l>kept a hearty Band with my Best Friend, and with many </l>
							<l>tears devoted myself afresh to him: Put Him in mind of his</l>
							<l>Promise viz: That He would once bring me into an</l>
							<l>Asylum, where I should enjoy a real Sabatic sea-</l>
							<l>son and Bridal Intercourse with Him, preparatory</l>
							<l>to his taking me into His arms and Bosom.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>He shewed me something more concerning my present call, than I</l>
							<l>found, Some others knew, and was to remain a sceeret between Him</l>
							<l>and me, I soon found myself at Home, and that he would bring</l>
							<l>me safely thro&apos;. I felt also that the Hearts of the Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> were tenderly</l>
							<l>inclin&apos;d towards me; so that we soon became one Heart and one</l>
							<l>Mind, and a Blessed Period commence&apos;d, tho&apos; under many Difficulties.</l>
							<l>Not long after, a certain Sabbatic mood and most intimat inter-</l>
							<l>course, between me and my Friend took Place; So that my</l>
							<l>Labour among the Souls, was my Delight, it per adventure</l>
							<l>I might happily gain some, to become lovers of this my so favourite</l>
							<l>Object. My Journeys were long and heavy, to go to the different</l>
							<l>Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi>, and I being very weakly made me oft secretly sigh and weep be</l>
							<l>fore my Friend: For it being just the depth of the winter that I come here,</l>
							<l>made walking in those bad roads almost impracticable; But here I must</l>
							<l>mention with the greatest gratitude &amp; humility the more then</l>
							<l>Brotherly &amp; Sisterly love and Faithfullness of my good, old,</l>

							<l>My little Room has been a Cabinet of Jewels to me, Therefore I have</l>
							<l>long concluded, that if our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> took me home here in Yorkshire, I</l>
							<l>would die in my nest, and so slip away, as it were incognito</l>
							<l>Since our dr B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boehlor&apos;s Visitation here, our Family has been</l>
							<l>brought again into the injoyment of our Choir Graces with our Choir</l>
							<l>to our very great abasement.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>For this Year last past, I have felt that my time was out</l>
							<l>in Gummersal, and last summer thought I should get a Call after</l>
							<l>the Synod; but could never find out any Place where I could be sent</l>
							<l>to. I once kept a hearty Band with my Friend about it, at the</l>
							<l>Conclusion of which, and summing up the whole, I said to Him:</l>
							<l>&quot;Now would it not be better thou tookst me home to thy <add place="above">own dr</add> self.&quot;</l>
							<l>I had no room to suspect any thing of the kind, from what I felt from him</l>
							<l>at that time; But July last, As I was in the Chaple <add place="above">Garden</add> at Work, He drew near</l>
							<l>To me in an extraordinary manner, and discover&apos;d to me Such an Union</l>
							<l>&amp; oneness between Him &amp; me, as is altogether unutterable, tho&apos; I </l>
							<l>did attempt to express something of it in a few Verses.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>From this time I had often gentle hints of a Change, of something that would</l>
							<l>take place, which should entirely suit me.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>In August last I got it Voilent Cold, which grew worse &amp; worse,</l>
							<l>And found my Lungs were infected. In the Beginning of Sept last,</l>
							<l>I felt myself strangly ill; so as I had never been before, which lasted</l>
							<l>some few nights &amp; days; And during the whole time, I was most happily</l>
							<l>Comforted with my Friends nearness, Insomuch that I felt no illness at all,</l>
							<l>only that I was weak and drowsy. One night, unasked for, He</l>
							<l>came Close to my Bedside, and stood there. My Heart saw Him,</l>
							<l>And my Soul adored Him! He dispersed intirely in a moment</l>
							<l>every painfull thought and Sensation, inwardly and outwardly</l>
							<l>I felt after one Wound and another sore; But behold! they were all</l>
							<l>healed. I felt after Sin, and there was no sin. I felt after misery</l>
							<l>and Dejection, But there was none to be found; And thus I was made</l>
							<l>sound and whole, except those pleasing Wounds of Love, which He</l>
							<l>had made long before in my enamour&apos;d Heart, But now more</l>
							<l>Deeply impress&apos;d.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Now it was, He gave me, the soft impression of his Gracious</l>
							<l>intention Concerning me; while I silently worship&apos;d before Him.</l>
							<l>On the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lorel called on us in her return from</l>
							<l>Duckenfield, and was quite alarm&apos;d at my seeming bad state</l>
							<l>of Health, would not rest, But insisted on my going to Fulneck,</l>
							<l>To stay there for some time which I did; where I assisted in</l>
							<l>seeing the Sisters for the Communion, and could not forbear to </l>
							<l>drop a word now and then concerning something, the very obscure of</l>
							<l>my happy Situation. On the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I return&apos;d to Gummersal, where</l>
							<l>my Disorder increased, And my Friend confirmed more </l>

							<l>Strongly what he had made allready manifest to me. I was very well</l>
							<l>seemingly, fix&apos;d and suited; But my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lorel could not be reconcil&apos;d</l>
							<l>to my staying at Gumersel, and I must own shew&apos;d more then Mothers</l>
							<l>Faithfulness and Affection: In these Circumstances she could not be</l>
							<l>prevailed upon to be Satisfy&apos;d, unless I came to Fulneck.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>I therefore set out in mere faith, with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Fowler and</l>
							<l>Joseph Peal Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
								<add place="margin">1769</add> and arriv&apos;d here safe, and meet with a very</l>
							<l>hearty Reception. The first d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Heart which saluted me, was</l>
							<l>my most dear and venerable Heart Anna Johanna; I was also made</l>
							<l>happily sensable of that genuine Love and hearty affection of the</l>
							<l>Choir in general, And more especially <hi rend="strikethrough">of</hi>
								<add place="above">from</add> all those in Office; so that</l>
							<l>that peace of God, and that Sabbath, which I never had heard any</l>
							<l>one possessing, at least so long before their Departure, accompanied</l>
							<l>me here also in the clearest manner, which begun at the time above</l>
							<l>mentioned, when our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> manifested Himself to me in such an</l>
							<l>especiall manner. But here I must mention some essential</l>
							<l>things, which I forgot to mention in their proper places, viz.</l>
							<l>After all that the Lord had done for me, and I was clear and well</l>
							<l>establish&apos;d in it: One Day, as He &amp; I were solacing ourselves in</l>
							<l>each others love, it came into my mind; But that oneness &amp; union</l>
							<l>which I had possessed in Him. I was not so clear in at this time: He</l>
							<l>shew&apos;d me, I was wholly in Him and He in me, and that we</l>
							<l>were One as he and the Father are One. I saw myself cloathed</l>
							<l>upon in Him, and possessed of all the Bridal Ornaments of the Bridegroom. </l>
							<l>I must therefore ascribe all the Honour and Glory alone to my own d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.</l>
							<l>eternal Slaughter&apos;d Lord and Saviour and conclude my</l>
							<l>Narrative with the Greatest truth in all the World: viz.</l>
							<l>That, Where Sin hath abounded, Grace hath abounded</l>
							<l>Much more.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Our venerable and Happily departed Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sarah Cennick,</l>

							<l>energy, as is not to be expresst in words, which bears an Indelible</l>
