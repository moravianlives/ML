					<p> I was born in <placeName>holbeck</placeName> in the <placeName>parish of Leeds</placeName> in the year of our <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>
						<date type="birth" when-iso="1717-05-18">1717 May ye 18</date> of very dear &amp; tender parrents who were prebytouryons but I was <name event="baptism">baptiz&apos;d</name> by
						a Minister of the <orgName religion="Anglican">Church of England</orgName> on account of their thinking of my soon departing this life Else I was educated in the Religion of
						the <orgName religion="Presbyterian">presbytierens</orgName> When I was a little Child and my mother Dressing of me She generaly told me I was now going amongst other Children
						to play, and I should perhaps hear them say bad words and Charg&apos;d me to take care I did not so, for it was a bad thing and this had such an Impression on my mind that It
						never left me, no not when I was amongst the Children, but always remain&apos;d in my mind that it was such a bad thing to do so <date when-iso="1724" cert="medium">from 7
							years old</date> I often went into a Corner to pray, that <persName type="deity">god</persName> would have Mercy on me and <name type="emotion">often wept before
						him</name>, when I had the <name health="disease">Smallpox</name> it was thought by every one who Saw me that I should have gone home, then <date when-iso="1724" cert="medium"
							>being but 7 years old</date>, but my mother on her knees often pray&apos;d the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> to Spare my Life howsoever I might be
						disfigur&apos;d with them I used to ask my mother what one might do to be Saved, and she told me I must pray to the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> and beleive on
						him and I should be Saved and I asked her if one could not be sure she said no she beleiv&apos;d not, but one must pray to him and beleive in him in my young years I came into
						Several dangers of my Life Especially once when I was drawing water at a deep Well, the Roulor which winds up the Rope came out of the frame, and it with the Swape went all
						into the well and pulled me on to my knees after it I Liv&apos;d Still with my parrents in a private manner kept no Company and at nights when work was done I used to go into
						the feilds and pray that ye <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> would have Mercy on me, I often Sigh&apos;d &amp; thought O that I was sure of my Salvation till <date
							when-iso="1731" cert="medium">I was about fourteen years of age</date> Some neighbour Girls about that time was throng in gotting fine Cloaths I also fell in with them </p>

					<p> with great eagerness I tought now I will have some pleasure of my Life Living a Religious Life &amp; takeing care as much as possible to avoid every thing that was bad thinking
						I might by that means injoy <name type="emotion">some pleasure</name> of my Life and go to <placeName type="religious">heaven</placeName> as others did <date
							notAfter="1733-05-18" cert="medium">before I was sixteen years of age</date> I met with a young man who told me, he had pitch&apos;d on me for his wife, I told him I was
						too young, he told me he would wait till I was older I found my self thereby drawn in to something, which when my dear &amp; tender parrents as well as my Sister <add
							place="above">heaped of </add>they did all in their power to brake it off out of tender love to me this <name type="emotion">greiv&apos;d &amp; troubld</name> me very much
						for some years I could not got it out of my mind, nor could I take any pleasure in any thing as before I had many good offers but being disapointed once it set me quite against
						it when I had gone now some years in this disatisfied Condition I heard that <persName ref="#mlper000536">Mr Ingham</persName> was going about to preach the Gospel, I went to
						hear him, and he preach&apos;d concerning the forgiveness of sins which was so much to me that it directly eas&apos;d me of all my former trouble &amp; uneasiness I came home
						weeping all the way for 3 mile which I had never gone before nor did I know the way till then my Dear parrents were much affected seeing me in such a weeping Condidition I
						pray&apos;d our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> to give me my parrents and the whole Family, which he did directly, I went to the meetings and often wept after
						the forgiveness of my sins &amp; the full assurance of it in my heart it was often to me in the midst of my prayers as if the Person above mention&apos;d stood before me &amp;
						I was praying to him this troubl&apos;d me very much I strove &amp; pray&apos;d with weeping to get him out of my mind at Last I turn&apos;d to our <roleName type="honorific"
							>Saviour</roleName> &amp; with great Egarness &amp; said to him <persName type="deity">Lord Jesus</persName> thou canst help me take this away from me which hinders me from
						seeking thy rich forgiveness for the sake of which I wou&apos;d part with every thing else I found he did help me and took it quite away where upon I thought he can do all
						things for me being Sure I could no </p>

					<p> by no <add place="above">other</add> means have got rid of them I pray&apos;d heartily to him, for the full asurance of the forgiveness of all my sins, which I could no Longer
						be satisfied about, at the same time hardly knowing what I wanted forgiving, but at once it came into my mind, that I had never Lov&apos;d <persName type="deity">God</persName>
						in my Life from thence flow&apos;d all my sins which I ever had done or said, then I went on mourning night &amp; day thinking I must be Lost, &amp; wishing myself any sort of
						creature but what I was, I work&apos;d at the same time among a company of 8 or 10 very wicked people in a shop, who spent their time in Singing songs or Swearing the day long,
						while I sat <name type="emotion">weeping &amp; praying</name> they thinking that I to be sure was going of my Senses, at that time in the midst of all this company, it was to
						me as if I saw our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> Cover&apos;d all over with Blood &amp; wounds, standing before me who told me that he had dy&apos;d for me
						&amp; received all those wounds in his Sacred Body on my account, <name type="emotion">my heart was filld with rapture</name> &amp; I wish&apos;d that the whole world
						coul&apos;d Join with me, to praise him I went a qarter of year without ever losing this impression, and feeling I then got, after this I begun to <name type="emotion">feel my
							self very poor, and left that feeling of Joy</name> which I had, this Causd me to mourn, &amp; think what I had grow&apos;d my dear <roleName type="honorific"
							>Lord</roleName> with about this time dear <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Bohler</persName> came into those parts who
						preach&apos;d our dear Saviours death &amp; wounds more clear then ever I had heard before, by this I learn&apos;d to know that I should remain poor and Low in my self, &amp;
						go to him in his wounds &amp; Blood Just as I was, then I begaun to reason over myself that I had not known his wounds &amp; blood aright, &amp; could not be satisfied about
						till I had Learn&apos;d to know them better so I wept and pray&apos;d so long before him till he again satisfied my poor heart, &amp; afresh let me feel the power of his wounds
						and Blood here upon I ask&apos;d my dear parrents to forgive me every thing where with I had grow&apos;d them &amp; thank&apos;d them at the same time for Learning me to read
						which struck them very much but I was glad to read the scriptures which were a very great comfort to me, &amp; the dear <roleName type="honorific">Holy ghost</roleName> pointed
						out to me thro them How I should go on, When I heard of the Brns Settling in <placeName ref="mlpla000084">yorkshire</placeName>

					<p> my heart was very much rejoiced <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<persName>Dicky Uttly</persName> spoke to me about writing to the <orgName>Congregation</orgName> for reception but I thought my self too poor &amp; mean to think of such a
						favour but I thought if it was our <roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> will y he had Calld me I wou&apos;d write to the <orgName>Congregation</orgName> in his name
						which I accordingly did and was re&apos;d on <date when-iso="12-25">Christmas day</date> old Stile the impression I then got continu&apos;d with me wherever I went of I was as
						if the spirit of the <orgName>Congregation</orgName> rested upon me, and I went on happilly till the next communion day, when I <add place="above">was</add> admitted Candidate,
						what I then felt I shall never forgot, tho it is beyond description to describe the feeling of my heart on that Ocassion the next time I injoy&apos;d the <name

							<roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> mov&apos;d into <placeName>Pudsey While</placeName> I remain&apos;d in <placeName>holbeck</placeName>
						it was my greatest pleasure with my Dear <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> to Entertain the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript"
							>rn</hi></orgName> &amp; <orgName>Sisters</orgName> who came to the <name event="religious">Soceity meetings</name> kept then at our House &amp; as far as laid in my power
