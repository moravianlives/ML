					<p> Eliz: Willson. I was born in Yorkshire in in the parish of Leeds in Feb<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1731. baptized in the Church of England.
						I was educated by my parents till I was 13 Years of age, then I was put apprentice for 6 Years, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I serv&apos;d faithfully, tho&apos; not without
						hardships, but I being of a lightsome Turn of mind I got thro&apos; better. for at that time I knew nothing of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, neither did I think of any
						religion, so I went on without tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>, sometimes my Father wou&apos;d ask me, come wilt thou go with us to hear the preaching to day, at w<hi
							rend="superscript">ch</hi> I was griev&apos;d, &amp; said no never while I live, will I go to hear them naughty people, then my parents tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I
							sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> come into something bad, because I seem&apos;d so wild, but for all that, I had no liking to that w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> my
						companions follow&apos;d, but always felt an aversion against it in my heart, at that time, I did not know how it sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be so, but now I </p>

					<p> know that it was my dear Lord that kept me, from all hurt &amp; shame. In my 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year my Master had the misfortune to be kill&apos;d, this struck
						me very much, but that went oft again without thinking any further, but that he was at rest; In my 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year I had a dream w<hi rend="superscript"
							>ch</hi> made such an impression on my heart, that I never forgot, my parents were afraid that something had happen&apos;d to me, my Mother ask&apos;d me if my mistress had
						been hard with me, I answer&apos;d no, it was something that I had dream&apos;d, then my Father came to me, &amp; said, come now tell me what it is, but my heart was quite
						full, however I told it, &amp; it was, I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> a man came to me, drest in a white surples, stood over me, &amp; look&apos;d very solid at me, then he
						spread his hands over me, &amp; then folded them upon his breast, &amp; I <hi rend="strikethrough">not</hi> knowing that I was in Bed, thot I <add place="above">will</add> lye
						quite still &amp; see what </p>

					<p> he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> do to me, then he smil&apos;d at me, &amp; began to write with his finger upon my forehead, for a good while, then he laid his hand upon my
						head with such a powerfull feeling that tears flow&apos;d without number, then he look&apos;d again at me and smil&apos;d &amp; turn&apos;d away &amp; left me, then I tho<hi
							rend="superscript">t</hi> I will fetch a looking glass to see what was done on my forehead, but I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> if he has wrote, I cant read writing,
						however I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> look &amp; when I saw there was written in large leders in crimson &amp; I cou&apos;d read it, &amp; it was; I will take care of the,
						thou shalt not be lost, &amp; when I awoke my pillow was quite wet with tears, &amp; I wept almost the whole Night &amp; c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not help it, for the
						impression remains to this day, &amp; will remain till I go to kiss those hands, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> was held over me, then I began to think that my time was <add
							place="above">not</add> out for then I had almost 2 Years to stay, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> indeed </p>

					<p> indeed seem&apos;d to me very long, but I began to think I will forget this feeling, &amp; be as I was before, but I cou&apos;d not, for it always came to me again, once I went
						to my Father &amp; privately took their H. Book, &amp; bro<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> it away with me, for I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
						see what my Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> sung out of that book, for they often sung when I was there, &amp; when my Mistress &amp; all were in Bed, I read in it, &amp;
						that verse: Yea wounds of Jesus bless me now; that verse soon took my mind, for I began to think who is that Jesus w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> has wounds, I tho<hi
							rend="superscript">t</hi> I know no meaning of this, however I read it over &amp; over &amp; the sametime tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>, as soon as my time is out, I
						will go to hear those people, that I have despis&apos;d so much, perhaps they will tell me more of that Jesus; so I did, when my time was out, I went with my parents, to hear
						the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> to my great joy for the first time, I heard them, they told of that Jesus, full of wounds wc<hi rend="superscript">h</hi> was made for poor
						sinners, this struck me deeply </p>

					<p> then I was soon taken into the society, I went on &amp; felt our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> near my heart &amp; was so happy that I thot I wanted nothing more, in his way
						I went on for near 7 Years, then I began to think of being rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, &amp; spoke about it, it happen&apos;d
						that some were rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> before me out of my class, &amp; I was left, then I was griev&apos;d &amp; thot they chose the worst, &amp; leave the best, for
						I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> myself the fittest, I therefore went away perplext indeed, but it did not re main long, for my dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> soon
						shew&apos;d me, that I was the worst of all, &amp; my happiness was nothing; then I felt quite miserable &amp; tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> it is no wonder, that I am
						unreceived for I am not fit for the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, nor any thing else, I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I had griev&apos;d our Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi> so much, that I dare not ask him to forgive me, in this situation I went on for almost a week, &amp; on Sunday I went to </p>

					<p> hear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> LaTrobe preach, he began with inviting all those that were the most sinfull of all, &amp; said that our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						stood ready to forgive every one that w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> come to him, even just as you are; O then I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I will go to him &amp; try
						whether he can forgive me, I therefore threw myself at the thro pierced feet of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, &amp; said to him dear Savr here is one of the poorest of
						all thy flock, canst thou forgive me. The feeling w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> over power&apos;d me, at that hour, my poor tongue is not able to express; it was as if our
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> said to me, I forgive thee all thy sins, yes I forgive thee ev&apos;ry thing &amp; own thee as one of my little Flock. </p>
