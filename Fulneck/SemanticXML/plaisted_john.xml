							Departed Nov. 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1761
							Personalia of the Single Br. John Plaisted
							He <add place="above">writes</add> of himself, I was born at West Titherton Wiltshire Febr the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1729. My Parents were religious People
							of the Church of England, <del>untill</del>
								<add place="above">when</add> the Methodists came into 
							that Country <del>and then</del> my Father join&apos;d them, at which
							time I was <add place="above">about 12 years old. In my 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I was</add> in some measure awakend by the Preaching
							of Br Cennik, grew very uneasy about my Salvation
							and followed the Ptreachers about the Country in order to hear
							something which might satisfy my Heart. My elder
							B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> not understanding nor liking this Course, perswaded me to go to Service with a Farmer, who lived not far
							from the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Chapel, they having come about this Time
							to Titherton. This he did out of a Principle of Love to me
							thinking thereby my Mind wou&apos;d be diverted <del>of</del>
								<add place="above">from</add> that uneasiness and melancholy which constantly attended me. 
							Here I lived 2 years. My Master not suffering me to hear
							the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> but compelled me to pass by the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Chapel on
							Sundays and to go to Church. When the distress of my Mind
							on this Account often made me weep, the other young
							Men my fellow Servants, being of a wild and Worldly
							turn of Mind, laugh&apos;d me out of it, by which means
							I forgot and stifted all conviction, took to the same
							Courses with them, and pursued all sorts of Vice and
							Worldly Pleasure which that Country afforded with
							all my Might till I was about 23 Years of Age; my Father did not fail from time to time to put me in Mind
							of my former Grace, and to admonish me in harmony
							with the dear H. Ghost in my heart, to give myself up
							to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, But shame and Confusion on Account of my
							backsliding and the entanglements of the World so overcame me! that I could not resolve to be entire-
							by our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> till I heard the Word of Reconcilation and
							Atonement in the Blood and Sufferings of Jesus
							Christ by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cennick again, about the beginning
							of the Year 53. This struck and Captivated my <del>Heart</del>
							Heart in such a Manner, that I coud not resist any
							longer; the Man of Sorrows in his Crosses Form
							drew near my Heart and I went and prayed in-
							cessantly for the Assurance of <add place="above">my</add>
								<del>Grace</del> Election <add place="above">of Grace</add> which
							I also happily obtained, but not withstanding this I
							could not be entirely at rest and satisfied untill I
							was quite amongst that People to which I knew I belong&apos;d

							and got Leave to live with the S B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> at Foxham in the
							Year 55, where B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Schulze was Labourer and received
							me into the House according to the entire Wish and Joy
							of my Heart. Here I prospered in the Hearts Acquaintance with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and had the Grace to be receiv&apos;d into
							the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1756. But the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Oeconomy
							in Foxham being broke up before my Reception into the
							Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> I went to live with a married B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in the same Place,
							where I remaind a Year and 1/4, and from thence came
							to live with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Utley at Tiherton. Here I
							had the inexpressible Grace in May 1758 to be made
							a participant of the Body and Blood of the Lord in
							the holy Sacrament with the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. Those Years that
							I lived with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Utley proved an unspeakable Bless
							ing, and of great Reality to my Heart, for here it was
							that I became rightly acquainted both with my
							self and also with the Friend of my Soul, who granted me the Grace to ground my self <del>and also</del> as a
							Sinner upon his Sufferings and Merits, and I wan-
							ted nothing to render my Days quite to my Satisfaction
							but the Grace and happiness to live in the S. B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi>
							Choir House at Lambshill, my longing desire after
							which was so strong, that I oftentimes cou&apos;d scarce
							sleep for thinking about it and speaking with our
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to make a way for me to go live there, and it
							was a great Joy to me, when I got the promise from
							our dearest Johannes that I should once go theither
							and at last the Hour came that I got Permession
							to go to Lambshill, which almost overcame me with
							Joy, and accordingly I got ready and set out for that
							Place in May; so transported that as I went along
							I scarce knew wether I walk&apos;d, run, or leap&apos;d; and
							indeed I did all of them so that had any Body seen me
							they might have thought I was not right in my Head
							and the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of June I arrived <add place="above">at</add>
								<del>with</del> the dear S. B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi>.
							<add place="above">on</add>
								<del>at</del> Lambshill, were I was at home directly and found
							this to be the Place for me according to the Impressi-
							on I had always had of it, and from the first of my
							arrival here till this Day have always thought I
							shall never be transptanted any were else till it is my
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Time to take me to the Congn, which is around him.
							So far his own Account.

							The Bretheren here soon got a real Love to him and he to
							them, and his genuine Simplicity and Honesty approved
							him to all our Hearts. In the first weeks he was employ&apos;d in
							various Matters and afterwards he became our Cooks w<add place="above">h</add>ere
							he approved himself as an indefatigable and faithful B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							to our great Contentement, and we were thankful for him
							in this Place. His character was, a truly simple upright
							<add place="above">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></add>
								<del>heart</del> in whom there was nothing crook&apos;d or treachorous
							and withal had a sensible and tender Heart, whose only
							Object was the Man of Sorrows, and <add place="above">in</add> his Choir Course was
							steady and happy, and his Election was w<add place="above">e</add>ighty to him. He
							frequently spoke to his intimate Acquaintance even in
							his healthy Days of his longing Desire to be at home, <add place="above">with</add>
								<del>by</del>
							our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, and particularly some Days before his Sickness
							he would often say, it what a happiness will that be, when
							I once shall be like our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in one Point, viz, to be laid
							out as a Corpse as he was. Thursday Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> he was
							seized with a violent Pain in his Head and Back, and
							the next Day took to his Bed and continued to have great
							Pain. He said directly he was very positive he should go
							home in this Sickness; and when he was lightheaded, which
							was pretty much the case, his Fancies were about nothing
							but going to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>; and would often call out I must
							go, he calls me; or he has sent a Messenger for me to
							conduct me home to him &amp;c. The 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the small pox came
							out and he was exceeding full and of a <del>bad</del>
								<add place="above">heavy</add> kind, but a-
							midst his great Pains he spent his Time very hapnily
							in Converse with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, wishing the Hour would soon
							come that he might have Permission to leave the mortal Tent; and thus his Days were spent to the Blessing
							and Satisfaction of those B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> about him and those
							who visited him. About the 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> he was considerably
							easier than he had been, and many B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> begun to think he
							would recover, but he still remaind steady with respect to
							his Certainty <del>to</del> that he should go, for said he, our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							himself has been with me, and assured me of it. When
							Verses were sung about his Bed he always join&apos;d <del>in</del>
							and sung aloud, with a peculiar happy Feeling, even
							if he was lightheaded, yea and when nobody sung by
							him, he spent a good deal of time <add place="above">in</add>
								<del>with</del> singing for him
							self. Towards the Evening of the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> it was clear
							that his Hour was not far off; he was sensible,

							but could not speak very intelligibly, yet the Word my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							come and take me we could often understand. At 10 o&apos;
							clok this Evening his departing Liturgy was sung, and
							during the singing, Go to thy Lord, and blush for Shame
