							went home Feb 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1770
							The course of Life of the Single Sister Grace Thornton
							I was born at Mirfield Nov<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>r 8 1736 Bap<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> on the Church of England
							haveing heard of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> from My infancy, I had a desire to go unto
							the meetings but my mother thought I was too young, but one day I ventured
							of my own accord &amp; stay<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> the whole meeting took Care to be at home before my
							mother, fearing she wou&apos;d be grive&apos;d, but when she heard of it was Much pleased.
							&amp; from that Time always took me with Her. &amp; whrn I was about 8 year old I was
							took into Care amongst the Child<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Helt. I liked the Childrens
								meeting
							&amp; also the school kept by the Sisters proved a great blessing to my Heart,
							in My 14 year I was took into the Gr Girls choir &amp; Heartily wish I might be a joy
							to our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. after My fathers departure I removed with my mother to live in
							Holm Lane that we right be nearer fulneck to injoy the meetings, &amp; about
							my 18 year I had the Smallpox in which sickness I was brought to reflect upon
							how my hearts stood with regard to its connection with our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> for I found
							my self much afraid of dying feeling my depravity of soul &amp; body &amp; that
							I had no assurance of going to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in my present situation, I laid my
							self as well as I cou&apos;d at His thro&apos; pirc&apos;d Feet for this gracious absolution &amp;
							the friend of Sinners took my fear away &amp; made My sickness more bearable to me
							on the 13 of nov<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> 54. I was received into the congration to My great Joy and
							deep abasement renewed my Covenant to be in soul &amp; body my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							&amp; I continued Happy &amp; chereful for some Time, &amp; in April the following
							Spring I was admitted a candidate for the holy sacarement to the blessing
							of my Heart, for it brought me upon being more Earnest with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							to prepare me for the injoymont of His body &amp; blood, but this I carried too
							far in My own Strength &amp; self working, &amp; thereby came into deep
							distress, my own depravity laid such hold of me that I had no
							more the Sight or feeling of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in My heart &amp; became cold
							and indiffrent to all the former promises which I&apos;<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> made Him
							&amp; I got a love for the world &amp; the pleasures which I saw other young
							people injoy: thus with forming various Ideas of delight unto myself
							I went to bed one might seamingly well pleased, <add place="above">w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></add> my proud &amp; High dispossition
							to conceal all these imaginary pleasures to my self &amp; I thought to sleep as
							at other Times but I&apos;<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> sooner laid me down my pleasures vanishd
							&amp; such distress came upon me that I spent the might in the bitteres Tears
							Crying our for mercy but felt no Sinner in My heart. this desstress
							continued so long that I thought it more then possable ever to survive it
							with My Senses; one day I retired unto a lonely place, fell upon My
							face &amp; My heart burst into a flood of Tears at My dear Lords Feet

							where I wou&apos;d gladly have said Lord have mercy on me! But I cou&apos;d not Speak,
							but Here found that fremd of Sinners nearer to my soul than ever I had
							felt before, He forgave His poor disstressd Creature &amp; set me free from
							all the Sin &amp; Guilt that stood before me, &amp; my Heart became as a little
							Child before Him; &amp; on april 16, 56 to I was confirmed for the injoyment
							of the Holy Saccrement &amp; in May following participat&apos;d of that Highest
							good in an Expressable manner as a poor pardond Sinner prostued before
							Him &amp; I injoy&apos;d many blessings in the d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Great Girls Choir.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							June 10 1757 I was receivd into the Single Sisters Choir here a new schooling
							commened in My heart &amp; I begd my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to take me afresh into His hand
							&amp; make me a true virgin thro&apos; His own precious blood, for I felt a
							daily need of Grace &amp; absolution
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							dec<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> 14 1758 I got leave to live at Gomersal Oeconomie at which
							place I was soon at Home much rejoic&apos;d at <add place="above">my</add> happy lot felt chereful
							&amp; Glad to live amongst the Sisters &amp; <add place="above">to</add> feel there Hearts Love for me;
							may 1760 I had leave to remove into the choirhouse at fulneck, which
							rejoiced me very much, beliveing I was removed from all danger
							&amp; had now got a Lasting home till I <add place="above">shod</add> enter into My Everlasting rest
							not long had I injoyd all these great &amp; Gracious previlidges but
							I began again to feel myself that needy one for whom there was
							no help but at the Feet of Jesus, to which place I had many by petty
							before He cou&apos;d get this poor sheep His poor blood bought worm to stoop
							So low &amp; when I think of this what I&apos;<hi rend="superscript">ve</hi> injoyd at that dear place
							my poor Thanks are far too short for all the Toil &amp; Labour that I&apos;<hi rend="superscript">ve</hi> cost him
							about one whole year in My Choirhouse I injoy&apos;d a Happy Saboth <del>for my</del>
							<del>Heart,</del> &amp; then came into great coldness &amp; indiffrency of Heart towards our
							dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; my Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> whom I thought did not Treat me according to my desirts
							&amp; instead of being a Sinner over My faults I grew High in Spirit &amp; brought
							myself into Such Circumstances as I never felt myself before beleiveing
							it impossible to come thro&apos; as I percived I had intirely lost the Sinner Tract
							therefore resolved to keep it all a secret in My breast &amp; take an opper<add place="above">tunity</add>
							to leave the House in private by walking out alone;
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							thus on setting out I resolved never to see the choir house more &amp; to
							turn My back upon all the hardships which I found too <add place="above">much</add> for to submit
							on my first steping out the Tears begun to flow plentifuly down My cheeks,
							&amp; every step seam&apos;d to pierce my very Heart; I had not walk<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> above
						
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>
						
							a quarter of a mile but I was struck so with fear &amp; Trembling that I cou&apos;d not
							approach one step further &amp; a voice came so to me was those words, if thou
							goest away thou will be ruind in soul &amp; body; turn again &amp; I will
							bring the through, I look<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> round me but coud see no person but felt
							the near presence of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in My Heart;
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							I return&apos;d with all speed unto My dear choirhouse with a <hi rend="underline">Thankful</hi>
							&amp; <hi rend="underline">chereful</hi> Heart unto My dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> for His great fauthfulness
							in helping of me Back &amp; after haveing deprived myself of 4
							months injoyment of the holy saccorement I was on the 12 of march 61
							admitted to that great grace again to my never deep forgotten abacemerst
							&amp; from this Time I become more open Heartd to my Labourers as I
							had never been before to My great loss &amp; shame &amp; pain.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							Thus far her own words. The particular grace our D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saviour bestowed
							on our Happily departed Sis<hi rend="superscript">tr</hi> makes us adore the friend of Sinners
							Who with unwearied Patience follows his poor helpless Worms; Convicts
							&amp; comforts; alternately; according as the poor deprav&apos;d nature can
							bear it; this was the Case with our Late Sis<hi rend="superscript">tr</hi> who did not like
							the searching love of her Lover, but had a secret inclination
							thro Pride to hide her faults; Which Stagnated her Course in the
							Injoyment of the Blessed Sinnoers Fellowship with her Choir Sis<hi rend="superscript">trs</hi>
							The Sencible feeling she had of it at the same time may be
							seen by a few lines; which she her self Composed
						
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg type="stanza" n="1">
							<l>I have so often gone astray</l>
							<l>And would seek help some other way</l>
							<l>Till I into great Danger came</l>
							<l>Which made me cry out for a Lamb</l>
						</lg>
						
						<lg type="stanza" n="2">
							<l>May I on Thee my Surest Rock</l>
							<l>Now fix my faith I nor from thee look</l>
							<l>I know from thee my health does</l>
							<l>When I around Thee Cling (Spring)</l>
						</lg>
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							Her Favourite Verses were the Late B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Christol&apos;s &amp; in particular
							That Hymn; With Sainfull Pennance thoughts Distressed
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							The Soul of my Belov&apos;d I See &amp;c.
							Whereby a tender Emotion of heart towards her Suffering Redeemer
							was very Persceptible in her; Oct<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> ye 9 she remov&apos;d into the sickroom
							which prov&apos;d a Blessed school to her; Which Our Saviour made up
							of to his own purpose, in delivering her from all her self delusion
							as well as from the painfull Sensation Occasion&apos;d by imposing on
							her Constitution about which she was truly poritent; And thro&apos;
							his Grace set her at Liberty from all porplexity, which had
							intrrupted her Course of Grace so manny years; This She expressed
							to her Labouresses with <add place="above">that</add> aimiable, absolv&apos;d Sinners Beauty;
							as Bespoke a Serene Dignity &amp; Clearness with the Friend of
							Sinners; in such a meltedness of injoyment that all about her
							partook of her happiness

					<p>
						
							From that time Our Saviour gave her the grace to relish &amp; injoy
							His Bleeding Merits, to her comfort and Satisfaction; and supplied
							all her wants richly; she had for some time past a secret
							intimation that her stay here wou&apos;d not be long, at which
							She rejoic&apos;d Like a child; at that Blessed Meeting when she
							Should see our Saviour, but her disorder having hung on her
							for some years being something astmatical we did not think
							it would be so soon; till about a week ago, she alter&apos;d
							porceptibly &amp; begun to speak with firm assurance, that her
							Hope wou&apos;d soon come to the full Injoyment, She thank&apos;d &amp;
							Prais&apos;d Our Saviour night &amp; day for His Love &amp; Goodness
							and often repeated. O my own dear Saviour how shall 
							I poor worm thank Thee enough; It is impossible for me
							to tell what He has done for me; Soon I shall have
							the favour to See Thee &amp; kiss these dear wounds which
							have heal&apos;d me; In this Happy Expectation she ended her
							dying, &amp; all Porplexity, Comforted &amp; reconciled, on the 12<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>
							between 1 &amp; 2 oclock <add place="above">in the after</add> noon with the Blessing of her
							Choir in the 34<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year of her age.
