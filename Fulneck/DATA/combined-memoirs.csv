John Darnbrook,name,"Accordingly on his Recommendation the Captain took me as his Steward I went on Board, but all Things were very awkward, having never been on Board of a Ship before & I knew no more about my office than a Child, but I soon got to understand, that the chief mate was in that Office the Voyage before. So I made if my business to get acquaint- ed with him and he with a bottle or 2 of Rum for he Loves Liquor then told me every thing, what I should do & what belonged to my office. Thus I got into the Way pretty well. We sailed from the River the latter end of March, & we were not long out at Sea, before I was sick & confined so for 15 Days. I thought many Times, if I was on Shore, they should be Sai- lors who would for me, But when I got better, I came thro' pretty well, as I had no ship's duty to do. It was a very cold uncomfortable voyage for about 4 months we returned very unsuccessfull, having got no more than one fish; I got from the Ship as soon I could, weary enough of my first Voyage.",

While we were so sick, we hung altogether by ourselves, It was one of the most shocking Times, I have had in all any Life, most of them died cursing & swearing, they all at one Time died, that were sick & left me alone. I prayed heartily to our Savr, that if He would spare me & bring me home again, I would be his & live for him, But when I got better, I soon forgot all his goodness & went on a wicked Course with the Rest of the Sailors, & I some times swore. But amidst all, I had many Con- victions, & I often could not sleep, but wept in my Hammock on account of the Course I had entered into. When we came to a Port there was generally nothing seen but Wickedness. I remember very well some times, that I was grieved in myself, has I could not be so bold in Wickedness, as the Rest of my company, & when I thought, that I would be so wicked as they, I generally had such Convictions, that I could not do like them. We had a good Voyage but with Regard to Externals we had it hard some times, & were about 6 Months without Bread, living on Rice.",
