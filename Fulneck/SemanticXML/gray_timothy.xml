						help myself. Soon after I became acquainted with one <persName>John Nelson</persName>, to whom I could freely open my mind. Upon his enquiry, I told him, how I had proceeded,
						&amp; that with all my endeavors I could not attain to rest for my soul, but found myself as wretched as ever. His answer was: I find that you are a poor slave of the devil. He
						then told me his experience, that he had been of the same way of thinking, but had found all laboring in his own strength to be in vain. He advised me to go to hear
								<persName>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wesley</persName>, he would teach me the right way to <placeName type="biblical">heaven</placeName>. </p>

					<p> me with cards<note>This word seems wrong. Check with KF</note> of love to himself. I longed but, as it were, to touch the hem of his garment, &amp; this our <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> graciously granted me, &amp; I felt, that he owned me as his. About this time I lived with my Sisters at
							<placeName>Birkenshaw</placeName>, where we were visited by the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>, my shyness towards them wore off by degrees, &amp; I
						soon had the favor <name event="reception">to become a member</name> of the <orgName en="congregation">cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>. Now a new school commenced
						in my heart, I learnt more &amp; more to Know my natural corruption, but my <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> likewise granted me the grace
						to depend more &amp; more upon him, for which I have great reason to thank him all my days. Soon after I went by advice of the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript"
							>rn</hi></orgName> to live at <placeName ref="#mlpla000059">Mirfield</placeName> with <persName>John Sheard</persName>, where I staid nearly 2 years, &amp; then spent 4
						years agreably with the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> at <placeName>Wyke</placeName>. Then I moved into the <placeName>single B<hi rend="superscript"
								>rns</hi> choir house</placeName> at <placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName> but here I got into company with some of a reasoning spirit, whereby I suffered
						hurt in my soul, &amp; this provedthe occasion, that I left the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> for some time, &amp; came to live at
							<placeName>Wyke</placeName>. Nevertheless my <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> held his hand over me, &amp; in his due time brought me
						back to his fold. Thus far our late <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> own account. </p>

						heavy to himself &amp; others, yet amidst all, it was evident, that his heart cleaved to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>, &amp; that

								<orgName>S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></orgName> &amp; he delighted to speak freely with them of what our <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> had done upon his
						soul. He prized his election of grace to belong to the <orgName en="congregation">B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, &amp; there was
						nothing he regretted so much, when confined by sickness, as to be deprived of the opportunities of blessing to be enjoyed by children of <persName type="deity">God</persName>
						in fellowship. He however endeavored in some measure to make up for this loss by reading diligently in the bible, &amp; meditating daily in stillness </p>

					<p> on the texts of the day, which was his constant practise, &amp; whereby according to his own testimony, he often received gracious visits from our <roleName type="diety">Sav<hi

							>depressed him greatly</name>, &amp; his <name health="disease">strength declined visibly</name>. His constitution was by degrees quite worn out, &amp; he sighed, like a
						weary traveller for repose, longing ardently to be released from pain, &amp; at home with his <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>. A couple of days before his departure;
						he declared that he had nothing, that lay heavy upon his mind, but was ready to go hence with joy, as a poor, but pardoned sinner, trusting alone in the merit of <persName
							type="deity">Christ</persName>, &amp; <name event="death">thus he fell gently &amp; happily asleep in the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName></name>, aged 76 years
						&amp; a few days. </p>
