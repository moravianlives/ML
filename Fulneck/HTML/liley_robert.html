    <h2>Robert Liley</h2>
    <p> Our B<sup>r</sup><a href="#mlper000429.html"><sup>Robert Lilley</sup></a> was born in the <em>Month of Oct<sup>r</sup>. <br /> 1697</em> at <a href="#mlpla000133.html">Higth Town in the Parish
        of Berstal</a> and was <br />educated in the established church. His Parents being <br /> poor, he was put out Apprentice very young, and suffered, <br /> during that time a deal of Hardship.
      Having learned <br /> the Clothiers Bussiness and being now <em>26 years of age</em>, <br />he entered into the married State with the present Widow, <br /> which Marriage our dear LordBlessed
      with 1 Son and <br /> 2 Daughters. One of the latter went happily to our <br /> dear Sav<sup>r</sup> before him, out at the <a href=".html">S. S<sup>rs</sup> House</a> here. His <br /> only
        Son<a href="#mlper000427.html">James</a> is an inhabitant of <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a> Cong<sup>n</sup>. <br /> and the other Daughter is married in the World. </p>
    <p> During the time of the great awakening here in <br /><a href="#mlpla000084.html">Yorkshire</a>, when <a href="#mlper000536.html">Mr Ingham</a> and others preach'd the Word <br /> of
      Reconciliation to poor Sinners, he not only went to <br /> hear as others did but he was soon convinced of <br /> the great need he stood in of a Sav<sup>r</sup>. Being now <br />concerned for
      his Happiness in time and Eternity he, <br /> as a Parent of his Children, Husband of his Wife, and <br /> Father of a Family, was equally concerned for the <br /> Salvation of his whole House,
      and was not satis- <br /> fied untill they all heard with him the precious <br /> Gospel from whence he expected life everlasting. <br /> According to that first Love and Zeal, which prevailed
      <br /> among the awakened souls in those Days he was also <br /> a Sharer of that well known great Love Feast at <br /><a href="#mlpla000132.html">Fieldhead</a>. And becoming now more and more
      sensible <br /> of his undone Condition, notwithstanding his having <br /> already experienced some comfortable Feelings of our </p>

    <p>SavioursGrace, he once during a Preaching of <a
        href="#mlper000536.html">M<sup>r</sup><br /> Inghams</a> became particularly happy, thro' the holy Ghosts<br /> applying the Word to his heart. When <a href="#mlper000602.html">M<sup>r</sup>
        Spangenberg</a><br /> went about settling Societies in these Districts he became <br /> a Member of the same. He having a great Love for the <br />Church he was brought up in and being now
      more clear in <br /> what one went properly to divine Service for, he continued <br /> going to Church for a long while believing that our Sav<sup>r</sup><br />blessed him there like wise. But
      as his Heart could be <br /> no more satisfied without Fellowship, and he not meeting <br /> with it there, this determined him to follow solely and <br /> alone the Track our dear
        Sav<sup>r</sup> Might lead him among <br /> the B<sup>rn</sup>, in which Resolution he was very steady, until <br /> he was recieved into the Cong<sup>n</sup>, which came to pass <em>Augst
          13<sup>th</sup><br /> 1748</em> on account of which Grace he was very much melted <br /> and thankful. <em>In the same Year, namely the 13<sup>th</sup> of Novr</em><br /> he went with the
        Cong<sup>n</sup> to the holy Comunion for the first <br /> time, and as he has never enjoy'd it before in his Life <br /> time out of a profound Respect he had for the same, His <br />Heart
      was so much the more bowed on account of this <br /> great Grace and concerning which he said: No Tongue <br /> is able to express the feeling of my Heart, that such <br /> a poor Worm as me, is
      permitted to enjoy this highest <br /> Treasure. This Awefull Impression of the holy Sacrament<br /> abade with him to the End of his Life. An accidental <br /> Circumstance proved the Occasion
      to determine him and <br /> his Wife to spend the Remainder of their Days in <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, <br /> and having obtained Leave to move thither, He was soon </p>

      <p> there with all his Goods without ever enquiring <br /> beferehand where he was to have his dwelling, which was <br /><em>May the 12<sup>th</sup> 1759</em>. His Grace Election was very
      important <br /> to him and which he kept continually in his Eye, and when <br /> he had the Favour to become Cong<sup>n</sup> Disceple, which Dignity <br /> he was twice invested with, his
      heart was so humbled <br /> and broken because of the Sense of his unworthiness that <br /> he went to his Son<a href="#mlper000427.html">James</a>, entreated him to assist him <br /> in praying
      our dear Sav<sup>r</sup> that His Intention with him <br /> might be obtained. In his Course and Walk, this in <br /> a Measure unobserved, he enjoy'd much of our Sav<sup>rs</sup><br /> Love and
      Grace, and so as he grew weaker and <br /> feebler in his Body his Tenderness towards his <br />Redeemer encreased, and his Longing to be soon with <br /> him grew more ardant. He was often seen
      weeping<br /> when by himself, and if asked what was the Cause <br /> of at, he said: These are not Tears of Sorrow, but <br />Tears of Love to my Saviour. When he was the <br /> last time at
      the holy Comunion in the <a href=".html">Hall</a>, he had <br /> an Intimation of it that this would be the last time <br /> he should enjoy that greatest of Blessings here below; <br /> But
      heartilywished that he might have no long and <br /> serious sickness in order not to give his B<sup>rn</sup> any <br /> trouble, which Request our dear Lord granted him <br /> like wise: for
      when on the <em>16<sup>th</sup> of Dec.</em> he went to <br /> Bed about 9 o'Clock in the Evening, he slept till about <br /> 1 o'Clock in the Morning, and at 2 o'Clock his Soul </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p>had alreadly taken its Flight into the Enjoyment <br /> of everlasting Bliss. His dieing Life lasted 75 Years. </p>PAGE BREAK</body>
