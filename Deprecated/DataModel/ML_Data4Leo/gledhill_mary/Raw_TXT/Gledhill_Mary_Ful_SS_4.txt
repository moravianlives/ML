The S. Sr Mary Gladhill who happily
departed this life Dec 1st 1809, has
left the following few lines concerning
herself. July 26th 1727.
I was born at Belly Bridge near Wyke
and baptized in the Church of England
from my earliest years I remember my
Mother taking me to hear Mr Ingham
preach, & I felt at that time, some 
thing of our Saviours nearness, which
I however did not fully understand 
besides my natural inclination being
after the world. In my 16th
year our whole family was afflicted
with a bad fever, of which we all 
got better accept my Mother who
dyed on it, we was now left in 
deplorable circumstances, I being the
oldest of the Children; the towns
people would give me no assistance, 
I had learned nothing to earn a lifely,
hood, and was now obliged to go from 
door to door to beg my Bread, I 
met with many Kind Benefactors 


who pittied me in my distress; after
sometime I went into service, from
one place to another, I found it very
hard & met with many troubles; having
no body to tell my concern to, nor
to care for me, I prayed to the
Lord to help me, about this time
I became aquanited with the Srs
Elizth & Sarah Holdsworth, and went
to live with them; they often spoke
to me about our Saviour, and I felt their 
had 
concern & good wishes for me, but no
inclination to attend to it. I spent
several years, in a very uneasy situation
of mind, during this time I heart 
Mr Eastwood preach on that text
of the ten Virgins, which had a par 
ticular effect upon my heart, for it 
was clear to me I was in the Class
of the foolish virgins, I wept before
our Saviour & prayed him to have mercy
upon me, & to forgive me all my
sins, I felt on this occation some, 
thing which I can not express,


Our Saviour showed me his loving &
forgiving heart, and I felt that he
had suffered, bled & died for me.
Being of an unsteady turn of mind I
soon came into things again which was
contrary to our Saviours will, an which
account I spent many heavy hours
but he always approved himself 
as my best friend, and took notice
of me the poorest among the needy.
Being now 
undetermined
whether to make application to belong
to the Brns Congn or to be a follower
of Mr Eastwood, I prayed to our Savr 
to make it clear to me, which way to 
turn, and he convinced me the Brn
where the people to whom I should
belong. Upon this I made application 
and obtained leave to come and
live in the Srs House at Gumersal,
this favour was granted to me Oct
10th 1760. for which I often thank
our Saviour with my whole heart
Thus far her own Account.


Our late Sr was soon at home amongst
us, and thankful for her Lot. 
Apr. 8th 1765 she was rec'd into the
Congn & Apr. 26th the following
year, she partook for the first
time of the H. Comn. After living
10 years in Gumersal she moved in
1770 to Fulnek, into the Srs House
here, where she spent the remainder
of her days, & tho she in that long
period, met with many trials, both
internal & external, yet her simple
reliance & confidence in the Lord
helped her thro in every case. 
She often used to say: "Our Saviour
and every body is very good to me
I can never be thankfull enough,
if I could only cleave closer to 
him, but he allways tells me, I am
his, & He will keep me to the end.
It can truly be said, Her happy lot
to know our Saviour & herself and to 
live in the Congn  was highly vallued
by her. She was contendt & chearful


in poverty & thankful for every good
gift imparted to her, and injoyed the
the Love & good will of every one.
In general she was blessed with good 
health, even in her old age, which also 
was a matter of great thankfulness to 
her. About two weeks before her 
departure she was seriously attaked
with sickness & womiting, but she thought
herself better again, & Nov. 25th she 
injoyed the H. Comn in fellowship
with the Congn, finding herself still
very weak & her Cough growing trouble
some, she submitted on the 30th to 
go into the Sikroom, on Dec. 1st being
asked in the morning. how she felt, 
she said; "Very well, I have no pain
" & do not think I am going yet to 
"our Saviour, but if it be his will
"to take me to himself, I am not 
"only resigned, but shall be happy
"to be with him whom I love above
all." She spent the day mostly in  


a slumber and in afternoon about 
Choak she was blessed for her departure 
which occation our Saviours presence
was sensibly felt, and soon after 
happy soul took flight into the 
arms of her Redeemer, in a gentle
maner, without a groan & seigh.
Aged 82 years 4 Months 5 Days.
