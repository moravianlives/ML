            <lb/>The Course of Life of the Single S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Mary Faucett
            <lb/>I was born in wyke in the parish of Birstol in the year 1748 &amp; Bap<hi rend="superscript:true;">tz</hi> by the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi>
            <lb/>&amp; when I came into My Childrens years I attended the Childrens Meeting with
            <lb/>great pleasure, being frequently reminded by the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> that we shoud
            <lb/>pray our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to give us Hearts to understand what we heard &amp; was told of Him
            <lb/>this I took great notice of &amp; used to pray my d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to bless me with such a Heart
            <lb/>&amp; make me such a Child as He was in this world.
            <lb/>I being of a Sickly Constitution brought me upon Examining myself with deep
            <lb/>reflections If my Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> shou'd take me out of this world How cou'd I stand before Him not
            <lb/>haveing got the wedding garment about which I spok many times with My Hearts
            <lb/>best friend; March 25 1760 I was received into the Great Girls Choir, on which
            <lb/>day I made a Covenant with my dr Savr to be Wholy His If He wou'd preserve the from
            <lb/>the powerful Inclinations I had of liveing according to my own sinful desires &amp; the pleasure
            <lb/>of this world, my Brisk &amp; lively turn of Mind let nothing pass unNoticed by me &amp;
            <lb/>tho' I look<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> But like a Child yet I cou'd soon feel a Complacency in every thing that
            <lb/>Contrary to My Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Mind, had He not out of mercy to my poor soul moved a
            <lb/>longing in My Heart to live amongest the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> in the Choirhouse to which
            <lb/>place if I did not come I should be forever ruin'd, this I made known to my
            <lb/>Labourers &amp; in The year 62 I had the Great previlidge of liveing in the Choirhouse
            <lb/>Granted to me, which I injoy'd with a bowed &amp; thankful Heart, Tho' I was very much
            <lb/>dissapointed in My Expectation thinking thereby to be Secured from everything
            <lb/>that cou'd cause me pain of Heart or mind, but I found myself still Subject
            <lb/>to all my former frailties &amp; imperfections;
            <lb/>being one day at my band I was closely remmind by the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> to devote myself intirely to
            <lb/>our D<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> in Soul &amp; body, Since I had now the favour to injoy the Great blessing
            <lb/>of Liveing aMongest His people, this made an abideing impression on me
            <lb/>&amp; I inhealed with the tenderest Tears that My Sa<hi rend="superscript:true;">vr</hi> would bless me &amp; make me
            <lb/>to His Hearts Joy; &amp; from this time I percived my Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> had helped me by His Grace to
            <lb/>injoy My Happy Lot with more satisfaction, till I begun to come upon Closer
            <lb/>reflection upon seeing so many of my Choir companions received into the Congreg before me, but when
            <lb/>I Look<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> into My own Heart I felt that my self righteousness deprived me of the poor
            <lb/>Sinners place in His affection, this broke &amp; melted me all to pieces &amp; my former wretchedness
            <lb/>was not half so dispicable to me as myself made righteousness Here My only Matchless
            <lb/>freind display'd His Sovererign power &amp; made me a depend Creature upon His Gracious Merits
            <lb/>so fore as I saw My needyness at this time &amp; it was by Much the Happiest Situations

            <lb/>I ever felt before in all my Life &amp; my Heart cou'd not but with the greatest
            <lb/>fulness repeat frequently that verse, Now be glory to the side repeated, that I
            <lb/>was to be, a blood needy Human soul not Treated w<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> Bright Angels Disteny Viz thus I went on for
            <lb/>some time in bowedness before My dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; on Jan<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 1763 had the Grace to be received
            <lb/>into the Congregation &amp; continue for some time in a Happy course, yet after all this
            <lb/>I came into a dry &amp; indiffrent State of Heart till the repented Labour of the d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> H Gh
            <lb/>made me Sinciable that my heart was yet a stranger to the bloody Grace &amp; pardoning kiss of
            <lb/>dearest Bridegroom &amp; without this I could not be as a virgin that walk in the
            <lb/>of His bridegrooms, The Consciousness of my deficience bore strongly on My Mind
            <lb/>all the oppertunites of Grace that I injoyd, &amp; in a particuler Manner the exhortation
            <lb/>given in the Hall on Nov<hi rend="superscript:true;">br</hi> 12 1765 in the evening came to My Heart is if only spoke
            <lb/>for me, wherein it was with that no one wou'd spend the following day without
            <lb/>receiving a full absolution from our dearest Lord &amp; Elder, my needy Heart poured
            <lb/>out its floods of Tears whenever I coud Creep alone into myself &amp; my Eyes Closed
            <lb/>not in rest that night, but waited with impatience for the Hour of General absolution
            <lb/>dureing which my bloody reconciler Laid his High priestly hands upon me &amp;
            <lb/>let me feel His absolveing Grace which Humble me to a worm before Him &amp; the reflection of
            <lb/>this Happy Moment was a repeated blessing to my Heart when ever I fell Levity or Lightness
            <lb/>overtake me, &amp; in The following year I had the Grace to become a participant of His
            <lb/>Holy Corpses &amp; Blood, which bowed me in the dust before Him &amp; on May <unclear>following</unclear>
            <lb/>received into the Sisters Choir; Thus fare is her own dictateing.

            <lb/>in her Great Girls Choir, it was perceived that our D<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
            <lb/>Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> had a peculiar work of Grace in her heart
            <lb/>not withstanding the feeling of Her Human Missery

            <lb/>yet The tender nursing of the Holy Ghost
            <lb/>brought Her to be plain &amp; open Hearted upright to Her
            <lb/>Labourers whenever her course was uninteligable

            <lb/>&amp; that she had in those years been shown the
            <lb/>Missery of Her Human deprivity thro the under
            <lb/>nursing of the H Ghost, was a matter that fill<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi>
