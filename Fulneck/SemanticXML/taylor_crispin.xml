						<persName ref="#mlper000562">Crispin Taylor</persName>, was born in <placeName>Wyke</placeName> in the <placeName>Parish of Birstall</placeName>
						<date type="birth" when-iso="1698-04-26">April y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 26, 1698</date>, and lived with his Father, who learnd him the Trade of a <name

							<persName>Mary Wilkinson</persName>, who is his present Wife, and had by her 9 Children, four of which are left behind, the other five went home before him. In his married
						State he approved himself a carefull, lo ving father and a tender Husband.</p>
					<p> When <persName ref="#mlper000536">Mr. Ingham</persName> first began to preach here about, he soon went to hear him, and his heart was touch<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> by the
							<roleName type="honorific">holy Ghost</roleName> in the first <name event="religious">Sermon</name> he heard. From that time, he sought all Opportunities to hear the Gospel
						of our D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> Death and Attonement After the Societies were settled here in <placeName ref="#mlpla000084">Yorkshire</placeName>, and put under
						the Care of the <orgName>Brethren</orgName>, he and his Wife upon their Request were also taken in amongst them, which was a great Satisfaction to both, and proved a Blessing
						to their hearts, which made them some time after very desirous to be taken into the <orgName>Congregation</orgName> and to be in a closer Connexion with the B<hi
							rend="superscript">rn</hi>. He therefore spoke with <roleName en="brother">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<persName>Toltshig</persName> about it, expressing his hearts desire to be wholy our <roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName>
						<date when-iso="1748-10-01">Oct the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1748</date>. he had after many earnest and repeated <name event="reception">Requests this favour granted

						<add place="above">&amp; his Wife</add>to the great Joy of his heart, for it proved an extraordinary Blessing to him, so that his Wife and all about him saw a visible Change,
						he being so <name type="emotion">chearfull, lively and happy</name>, as they never had seen him before. This continued with him. He was a simple and up right heart, and when he

					<p> things, he used to say: What is this to us, the Lamb will know it best; and again: Let us wait for our <roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> time, his time is allways
						the best. Soon after this his heart secretly longed to partake of The  Corpse and Blood of Jesus in the <name event="sacrament">Sacrament</name>, when  unexpectedly he was sent
						for, and told by the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> that  our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>; who knew his hunger would soon  accomplish his desire, and should therefo be confirmd and blessed, which made his heart very glad
						and more attached to the Wounds of Jesus. <date when-iso="1749-03-24">March the 24 1749</date>. he partook of the <name event="communion">holy Communion</name> for the 1<hi
							rend="superscript">st</hi> time when his Soul and Body was so afected and penetrated thro &amp; thro with the martyrd Corpse &amp; blood of <persName type="deity"
							>Jesus</persName>, as he could not express it with Words. He was <name type="emotion">so happy in his heart</name> and felt such Blessings that he scarce knew, what he eat
						of drank, or how he walkd or workd for many days, and this sound he felt ringing in his ears perpetually: My flesh is meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed. And indeed it
						proved itself to him real Life, and  Meat and Drink to his Heart. When his Wife was concernd, that she did not partake with him of the  same Priviledge, he behaved very tender
						towards her, and comforted her, saying: Have a little Patience, for the Lambs time is the best.</p>
					<p> Several years ago he had got a Surfeit by heating  himself with working over hard, which for three years past, has at times troubled him much with a <name health="disease"
							>severe Costiveness and Pain in his Bowels</name>. <date when-iso="1752-10-07" cert="low">About 10 weeks ago</date> he was taken with it again but continued chearfull and
						quite resigned to our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>; <roleName en="brother">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<persName>Oxlee</persName> went to see him, and when he  <note type="catchword">loo-</note>
					</p>
					<p> looked at him, he found him so solid and grounded, and with such a Sinnerlike Shame, as he never be fore had observed in him, So that coming home he said  to his Wife:
							<persName ref="#mlper000562">Crispin Taylor</persName> ripens fast for Eternity.</p>
					<p>
						<date when-iso="1752-10-28">Oct The 28</date>. <name health="disease">He grew worse and could work no more</name>. But soon after was obliged to keep his Bed. <roleName
							en="brother">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<persName>Oxlee</persName> visited him, and asked him, whether he thought he  should be soon well again? He answered softly (for he feard his Wife would hear him and be grieved
						at it) but yet very chearfully, and said: No, I shall go to my D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>, and further being asked: Whether he should like to go home, he answered O yes, with all my heart and Soul; I would go this night,
						if it pleased him, but yet I&apos;ll wait till he calls me, for his time is the  best. <roleName en="brother">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<roleName en="sister"><add place="add">&amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></add></roleName>
						<persName>Hauptmanns</persName> soon after came to Scholar to speak with the <orgName>Communion</orgName> B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>:
						and calld on to see him, of which he was exceeding glad and spoke of it with great Joy. Some days after <roleName en="brother">B</roleName>
						<persName>Oxlee</persName> came to see him again, and found him asleep, and as he had had no Sleep for many nights, because of his <name health="disease">extreme pain</name>,
						he would not have him disturbd. But after he got wake his wife told him of it. O sayd he: Why didnt you   wake me, for I love the <orgName>Brethren</orgName>
						<add place="above">with my whole heart</add> and am very glad of their Visits, especially him, who lives so near me, and I am allways better after I have Seen any of them.

						<roleName en="brother">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<persName>Oxlee</persName> visited  him again; and being asked to pray for him, he  asked <persName ref="#mlper000562">Crispin</persName>, what his heart desired most, at which
						he looked up, smiled and sayd: my hearts  <name type="emotion">Desire is, to be with my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<persName>Oxlee</persName>, who came to see him, asked, how he found himself, he said: my <roleName en="brother">Brother</roleName>, perhaps I shall not go yet, alltho I should

					</p>
					<p> pulld him down to him to kiss him. He told him that he took it very kind that he came so often to see him and thankd him many times for it. He was then a little easier. He was
