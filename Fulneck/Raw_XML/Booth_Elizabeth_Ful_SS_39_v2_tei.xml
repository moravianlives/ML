					Elizh Booth <lb />
					I was born Sep<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> 22 1735 at Mirfeild My parents <lb />
					belonged The Church of Eng<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>, in My younger y<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> <lb />
					I came into a Concern about My Salvation &amp; according <lb />
					to my way of Thinking had it very much at heart <lb />
					to please the Lord in hopes that he wou&apos;d save <lb />
					me, in My 6 year I had a particular Impression <lb />
					from a dream were I saw our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in My room I <lb />
					went to him &amp; askd him to bless me me, he told me <lb />
					 I must be dipt in a fountain &amp; then I shoud be his <lb />
					which promise I never forgot</p>
					<p>
					when The B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> came to preach at Fox rojd I went <lb />
					thither with my Mother &amp; got a Love for them <lb />
					when B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Helt came to have the care of the <lb />
					Children His Meeting was a great <del>peculiarly</del> <add place="above">a great</add> blessed to <lb />
					my heart &amp; in particular when he Spoak of our <lb />
					Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> death &amp; Suffering to purchas our Salvation <lb />
					I was very much affected thereby &amp; <del>M &amp;</del> my heart <lb />
					Melted into Tears, as I grew older I felt my corruption <lb />
					&amp; the great propensity I had to Sin Made me very <lb />
					dark &amp; Miserable as I thought no one was so Spoilt <lb />
					&amp; full of Evil as I felt My Self altho I had a Love <lb />
					for Sin yet through disstress of mind I was fridened <lb />
					from <add place="above">commiting of</add> gross Sins &amp; instead of going to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as a  <lb />
					Sinner I fell to Self working &amp; striving to belief <lb />
					but coud attain no consolation for my Soul by it. <lb />
					I often use<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> to walk alone &amp; pour out my concerns before <lb />
					the Lord but Still preceived that my Missery increased <lb />
					&amp; felt as If I shoud be condemd &amp; lost forever beleiving <lb />
					it Impossable for our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to have Mercy upon such <lb />
					a wretch as Me in this My Disstress<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Condition

			<p>
					I was visited by the Sisters to them I Spoke My whole <lb />
					heart as well as I cou&apos;d &amp; beg&apos;d them to tell me If there <lb />
					was Grace &amp; Mercy for me they comforted &amp; incouraged <lb />
					me Much &amp; told me that it was our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Grace that  <lb />
					made such deep disscoveries of my Sinfulness that <lb />
					he Might Heal &amp; Save Me, but I being of a reasoning  <lb />
					turn of Mind Soon doubted of the realitie of this &amp; woud <lb />
					not be comforted any other way then by our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
					Manifesting himself personably to My heart as <lb />
					Clearly as If I saw him with My bodily Eyes <lb />
					I wou&apos;d believe my Sins forgiven.</p>
					<p>
					I continued in a heavy Course for a Considerable <lb />
					Time through My unbeleive of <del>Heart</del> not withstanding <lb />
					my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> never Left me his poor Child but <lb />
					followed me with unwearied patience but in  <lb />
					My 17 year I began to grow tired of my own attempts <lb />
					to help my Self &amp; thought If perish I will now perish <lb />
					at My Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> feet</p>
					<p>
					one day when I was praying our <lb />
					Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to take me as I am I had no sooner given my <lb />
					Self into <add place="above">the hands of</add> my redeemer, but he was pleased to mani <lb />
					fest himself to me, &amp; Stood So Clearly before My heart <lb />
					&amp; Eyes in His wound figure so that I was quite Struck <lb />
					&amp; overcome with his Beauty. here I felt the <unclear>assurance</unclear> <lb />
					of the forgiveness of all My Sins by which My great distress <lb />
					of heart &amp; mind was quite removed Oh how I felt I shall <lb />
					never forget my heart was quite captivated by my bloody <lb />
					freind who was now becomed my Only Object I can <lb />
					never Express in words what peace &amp; Life My poor <lb />
					heart injoyd for I Say of a truth when in his <lb />
					blood I saw him Swim a Small drop I did get, which free<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> <lb />
					him to me me to him the first time that we meet,
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					After This a desire arose in My heart to be receivd <lb />
					into The congregation tho&apos; I felt My Self very unworthy <lb />
					of that Grace Therefore <add place="above">I said nothing of it to my Labourer</add> I Spoke Childlikely to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
					about it leaving it at the Same Time to his decision <lb />
					being very Timerous of myself Least Least I  <lb />
					Shou<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not <del>prove</del> <add place="above">answer</add> &amp; faithfull <del>to that happy lot of Grace</del> to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, &amp; his people <lb />
					however not withstanding all my unstillness our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grantd <lb />
					Me that favour on nov. 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1752 here I gave My Self anew <lb />
					to become a joy unto our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; his congregation in the <lb />
					beginning of the year 53 I <del>had</del> <add place="above">recieved</add> the <gap reason="illegible"/> news <del>brought</del> <lb />
					Me, that I had leave to come into The Choirhouse &amp; My long <lb />
					wish<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> for desire was attaind on feb 3. And on the 13 of aug<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> <lb />
					I was receved into The Single S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Choir <del>on this day</del> <add place="above">on this</add> to me</p>
					<p>
					Ever Memorable day I devoted myself anew in <lb />
					with Soul &amp; body to My Manhood only Spouse to <lb />
					become a true virgin to him</p>
					<p>
					in the year 53 Sep<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> 9 I had the unspeakable Grace <lb />
					to become a participant of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> body &amp; blood in <lb />
					the holy Communon, This melted me like wax in <lb />
					the dust <del>befe</del> at My Bridegooms feet Thus I went <lb />
					on in a Cherefull happy Manner &amp; in 1754 <lb />
					when Our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> papa &amp; Mamagen was hear I had <lb />
					the favour to be present at that so remarkable <lb />
					Choir Communion what that proved to My heart <lb />
					Im not able to disscribe in words, from that time on <lb />
					the d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holy Ghost begun a new school with me <lb />
					wherein I became <del>truely</del> more &amp;none Senciable of my <lb />
					Great difference in the Choir point &amp; that there <lb />
					was Many things in Me which wanted be be deadend <lb />
					&amp; Sanctified thro The power of his Corpses &amp; blood <lb />
