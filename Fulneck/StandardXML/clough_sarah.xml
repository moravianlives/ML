            <lb/>The Course of Life of the Single Sist<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sar<hi rend="superscript:true;">h</hi> Clough
            <lb/>Concerning which she has left the following,
            <lb/>I was born augst 15 in the year 1744, in the Parish of Burstel, in Yorkshire
            <lb/>and Baptiz'd in the Church of England, My Parrents being
            <lb/>in Conviction with the Brotheren in my Infancy I in Consequence 
            <lb/>have been under their care from a Child, I frequented the
            <lb/>Meetings kept for the Children with great pleasurs, Till I grow
            <lb/>up to be a great girl, When my Natural Depravity began to
            <lb/>Show itself, I got a Desire for the pleasures of this World,
            <lb/>in Which I cou'd not gratify my self by reason that my Parrents
            <lb/>Belong'd to the Brethron, Which I heartily wishd had not
            <lb/>been the Case, But Our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> soon Overcame my heart again, by
            <lb/>means of a Meeting Which B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> <unclear>Occertshous<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi></unclear> hold one Sunday, in 
            <lb/>Gumersal Chappel, Wherein I was fully Convincd of my wrong way
            <lb/>of thinking, and cou'd never rest till I came into a nearer Conection
            <lb/>by Reception into the Society, In 1762 on the 19 of September
            <lb/>I Obtaind leave to live in the Sist<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Oeconomy at Gumersall
            <lb/>Which rejoic'd me verry much, and the 4 of May, following
            <lb/>was re'd into the Single Sist<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Choir, to a real Blessing for my Heart
            <lb/>Aug<hi rend="superscript:true;">st</hi> 13 1763 I had the Grace to be rec'd into the Congregation
            <lb/>Which was quite a peculiar grace and Blessing to me, Tho' I
            <lb/>Soon came <hi rend="superscript:true;">from</hi> affect, and came into a more dry and indifferent way
            <lb/>in my self, in 1765 Feb<hi rend="superscript:true;">ry</hi> ye 22 I remov'd from Gumersall,
            <lb/>into the Choir House at Fullneck, Where I spent <hi rend="strikethrough:true;">several years</hi> Some time
            <lb/>without much Concern about my self or any thing, Till our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
            <lb/>thro' His Holy Spirit brought me to Recolection over my Course
            <lb/>in General, I grow upon this very Miserable, and thought Our
            <lb/>Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> cou'd never forgive me, for so Mispending my time, being of
            <lb/>a Close dispostion, it was some time before I cou'd speak this
            <lb/>My concern, but frequently intreated Our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to help me,
            <lb/>Which he accordingly did, So that I cou'd speak of my Distress
            <lb/>quits Openheartedly with the Choir helper, as also my thoughts
            <lb/>Concerning the H Communion, She Comforted me about every thing,</p>

                                    <p>
            <lb/>asuring me that I shoud be thought on, June ye 20 1767

            <lb/>Our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> wou'd bestow this Grace upon me in his own good time
            <lb/>and on the 7 of Nov<hi rend="superscript:true;">br</hi> ye same year I became a participant

            <lb/>tender longing soon to be at home with her Redeemer, whose
            <lb/>Comforting Nearness was her support, under her long and painfull
            <lb/>illness, which towards the Later part was very acute,
