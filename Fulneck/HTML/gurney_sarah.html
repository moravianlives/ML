      <h2>Sarah Gurney</h2>
      <p><a href="#mlper000246.html">Sarah Gurney</a>. <br /> I was Born in <a href="#mlpla000137.html">Mimms Middlesex</a>, <em>Oct<sup>r</sup> the 27<sup>th</sup> 1745</em>. My Parents
            <del>was</del><sup>were</sup> of the <br />Church of England wherein I was Baptiz'd &amp; brought up. In my Childhood <br /> I was convinced of sin &amp; felt I was not right &amp;
         alreadly then believed that I must <br /> attain to something at yet unpossess'd, or I could not be saved. My natural diss- <br /> position was flighty so that what tender impressions I had
         in my heart, <del>was</del><sup>were</sup><br /> of short duration. When I was <em>13 years old</em> a Discenting Gentlewoman took <br /> me into her family, where I was instructed in
            <del>those</del><sup>the</sup> principles <sup>of that denomination</sup>; I read their <br /> Bookes &amp; particularly Backesters Call to the unconverted, which frighten'd<br /> me
         exceedingly, for I felt I fell short of all righteousness, &amp; therefore endeavour'd <br /> to reform my life by more strict observance of my duty, especially by reading, <br /> praying
         &amp; frequenting the meetings, which I prefer'd before those of the <br /> E. Church, because I thought these people were more sincere. In <em>1730</em> my <br /> Father being sick I visited
         him &amp; was greatly concerned for his Salvation, <br /> &amp; therefore kneel'd down by his bed, read &amp; pray'd by him, putting the Bible <br /> into his Hands, when he open'd to that
         portion of Scripture, Remember <br /> thy Creator in the days of thy youth, that when thou art old he may <br /> not be hid from thine Eyes. This so Affected me that I immediately rose up,
         <br /> giving up all the concern I had for my dear Fathers happiness, trusting to <br /> this Lord for his Salvation, taking those words as a demand from <a href=".html">God</a> upon <br />
         me; nevertheless the loss of so affectionate a Parent affected me so, that I <br />wish'd to be buried with him, believing I shou'd never care for life any more. <br /> In <em>1733</em> my
         Lady also departed &amp; I return'd to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, where I waited on 2 <br /> young Ladies, who with their Mother Lady Askew <del>was</del><sup>were</sup> of the
         E. Church <br /> but lived in all the gayeties of this world. Here I forgot my former resolutions, <br /> I went into all manner of those so called innocent diversions viz Cards, <br />
         Dancing, plays &amp; yet not without strong convictions which at times caused <br /> me very heavy reflections. In this family I was in the way of many &amp; great <br /> temptations, so that
         at length I was obliged to leave my place, &amp; got another <br /> in <a href="#mlpla000239.html">Putney</a>, where all my convictions return'd, &amp; a deep sense of my miserable<br />
         condition caused a melancholy to overwhelm me, which notwithstanding the <br /> advise &amp; admonitions of Ministers &amp; who endeavor'd to persuade me that I <br /> enough yet I was
         convinced of the contrary &amp; wanted to find out a <br /> of <a href=".html">God</a>, for I firmly believed there were such in the world &amp; that they </p>

      <p> could help me.
         The housekeeper in the family being a relation of the late <br /><a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Williams</a>, <del>she</del> invited him one day to Tea, which gave me an oppertunity <br />
         (when she went out) to ask him what religion he was of? He told me the Church <br /> of England; I being concern'd &amp; he appearing the same to me, I took the freedom <br /> to ask him of
         he always went to the Church, he ans'<sup>d</sup> not always; I desir'd<br /> to know where then; he told me there was a religious Society in <a href="#mlpla000004.html">Fetter Lane</a>.
         <br /> I ask'd him if I might have leave to come? he said yes, as also told me the <br /> time of they meetings &amp; promis'd (it being winter) to come for me, which he <br /> faithfully did
         the next Sunday at 5 in the morning. Here I heard <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Brown</a><br /> preach from the Text He was wounded for our transgressions, he was <br /> bruised for our
         iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, &amp; with <br /> his stripes we are healed. We had not set long before the people from <br /> without peltered us with stores &amp;
         bricks breaking the windows &amp; doing much <br /> mischief, so that I was very much frightened &amp; not able to attend to the Sermon. <br /> The late <a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup> Loyd</a>
         by whom I sat bad me be compos'd, for she had that <br />confidence in the Lord that he would not suffer us to be hurt, &amp; when the <br /> preaching was over ask'd me how I had lik'd it? I
            ans<sup>d</sup> I could not tell, <br /> for altho' I was very desirous to to sav'd, yet I believed I shou'd never come any <br /> more there, for I was terribly frighten'd, &amp; thought
         that thereby I risk'd my <br /> life, consequently I went no more for 3 years, during which time I was wishing <br /> much to get into a Nunery, &amp; did all in my power to attain to the
         same, but <br /> as I was informed that I must go to <a href="#mlpla000240.html">France</a>, for which I had not ability <br /> otherwise then as a servant, which I did not chuse, as I was
         informed they <br /> would use me as their slave, <sup>I dropt that scheme</sup>; At this time there was to be a confirmation <br /> in the Church, when I consequently with many other young
         women was <br />confirm'd by the Bishop, &amp; the Sunday following partook of the Lord's <br /> Supper during which I felt the Lordblessed me. After all this I got <br /> an inclination to
         go again to <a href="#mlpla000004.html">Fetter Lane</a> &amp; found there was a Congn settled <br /> &amp; all stillness, where I again met with <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Willams</a>
         &amp; <a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup> Loyd</a> whom I knew, <br /> I was directly assured in my heart that they were Child<sup>n</sup> of <a href=".html">God</a>, &amp; that to <br /> them I
         belonged. I was priviledged with going to all the meetings on that <br /> day, whereby I was more devinely assur'd of my heavenly calling. The <br /> following week <a href=".html"
               >B<sup>r</sup> Williams</a> sent me a note to come the next Sunday, </p>

      <p> when I should see some pilgrim B<sup>rs</sup> &amp; S<sup>rs</sup>, I did not understand <br />
         his meaning, yet when I was present at a meeting, held to the S. Women<br /> by the late <del>Disciple</del><sup>ordinary of the Brn</sup> in <a href="#mlpla000139.html">German</a> which <a
            href="#mlper000602.html">B<sup>r</sup> Spaningburg</a> interpreted <br /> &amp; at which was present <a href="#mlper000213.html">Anna Nitchman</a>, <a href=".html">Benigna</a> &amp; <a
            href="#mlper000717.html">S<sup>r.</sup> Anna LaTrobe</a><br /> I soon understood they were the pilgrims that I was come to see. <br /> My coming to the B<sup>rn</sup> was kept secret from
         the family for 3/4 of a <br /> year till at length they got intelligence that I went after a religious <br /> sect of people, which bore an indifferent character, &amp; they fearing the
         <br /> consequence sent for the Minister which had me confirm'd, he questioned <br /> me very strictly about the B<sup>rn</sup>, &amp; ask'd me whether I realy knew that I <br /> was going
         among a pearcel of strolers. I told him he must be mistaken <br /> for I was convinc'd they were Child<sup>n</sup> of <a href=".html">God</a>; he said how had I come <br /> to this knowledge?
         I told him I had felt it in my heart, that there was <br /> no salvation but in the Gospel they preached thro' faith in our Saviour<br /> to the forgiveness of sins; upon which he wish'd me
         to say what sins <br /> I had committed, I ans<sup>d</sup> him I felt myself full of sin, altho' I had been <br /> preserved from outward transgressions &amp; knew I must have
         forgiveness<br /> otherwise I cou'd not saved. He ask'd me many more questions, so that <br /> at length I grew quite weary went &amp; fetch'd him all the Books that <br /> I had then in my
         possession of the B<sup>rns</sup> &amp; desir'd him to read them <br /> atentively &amp; then return them again; with this I left him at that time <br /> but in a few days he sent for me to
         his House return'd me the Books and <br /> saying he would have me consider it well over before I left the <br /> Church. I told him, I knew what I was about, as also the people &amp;
         <br />wish'd he knew them as well. After this conversation he came to our <br /> House &amp; desir'd my M<sup>rs</sup> to part with me, I being a very dangerous <br /> person &amp; enough to
         infect her whole House. I felt an exceeding great <br /> love for the B<sup>rns</sup> people &amp; wish'd more earnestly for a nearer connection <br /> &amp; beg'd our Saviour to make known
         his lovein my heart, &amp; from this <br /> time was convinced had no righteousness, therefore ceased not to pray <br /> our Saviour for forgiveness &amp; that he wou'd cloth me with his
         righte- <br /> ousness, which soon after I felt in my heart &amp; was as a new born child so <br /> free; it was as if our dear Saviour had shed his blood alone for me, I was <br /> quite
         happy &amp; every way well. This happiness lasted about 3 months, </p>

      <p> but not knowing my own poverty &amp; weakness &amp; that I stood in need of <br /> renewed Grace every
         moment, I grew dark &amp; miserable &amp; reason'd against our <br />Saviour feeling an unwillingness to be stript of everything &amp; saved alone <br /> by him, I was often frightened at the
         sight of my self &amp; was wretched to <br /> the last degree: but the dear H. Ghost ceased not that work which he has <br /> begun in my heart but as I afterwards found all was unmerited
         grace &amp; <br /> favor. I took the Hymn Book up in my distress &amp; open'd to that Verse ye <br /> wounds of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>bless me now &amp; blood of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>
         flow me thro' &amp;c. &amp; I found again <br />confidence to our Saviour. I came again to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> &amp; was hirred in <a href=".html">M<sup>r</sup>
            Raymonds</a><br /> family. <em>1747</em>I was rec'<sup>d</sup> into the Cong<sup>n</sup> which was really blessed to me &amp; <br /> felt a longing desire to partake of the H. Sacrament,
         but a deep sense of my own <br /> unworthiness &amp; the feeling of my wretched nature made me afraid to venture <br /> on so sacred a matter, <em>therefore waited 2 years longer</em>, when I
         had a particular <br /> favorable opportunity with <a href="#mlper000213.html">Anna Nitchman</a> &amp; <a href="#mlper000699.html">A. <sup>Johanna</sup></a> in <a href="#mlpla000242.html">Red
            Lyon Square</a><br /> who advis'd me to leave my place, which I readily did &amp; came to live with S<sup>r</sup><br /><a href=".html">Stonehouse</a>, I was soon admitted to the H.
            Com<sup>n</sup> which made a lasting, <br /> impression on my heart for I knew &amp; felt I fed on the Lords body &amp; blood, but <br /> nevertheless I often hinder'd myself of many
         blessings thro' unfaithfullness <br /> which occasioned often hours of distress, but the dear H. Ghost often repre- <br /> sented to my heart the sufferings &amp; dying love of Jesus to
         procure my peace<br /> which made me truly ashamed &amp; a real <sup>humble</sup> sinner. After my M<sup>rs</sup> decease I <br /> I was sent by our dear <a href="#mlper000213.html">A.
            Nitchman</a> to the Boys <del>Oeconomy</del><sup>Nursery</sup> in <a href="#mlpla000195.html">Mile end</a><br /> where I enjoy'd a very happy period &amp; sabatic season. <em>1754</em> I
         came to <a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup> Larish</a><br /> in <a href=".html">Linsey House</a> from whence in <em>May 1755</em> we set out for <a href="#mlpla000001.html">Hhuth</a> where we
         <br /> arrived <em>July 12<sup>th</sup></em> here I was with my whole heart which made my time pass the <br /> better with my much respected<a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup> Larish</a>. After her
         happy Departure I had <br /> the favor to go to the <a href=".html">C <sup>Choir</sup> house</a>, where I have enjoy'd many unspeakable <br />blessings for my poor heart, particularly in the
         C C<sup>hoir</sup> meetings which the late <a href="#mlper000566.html">Count</a><br /><del>Disciple</del> kept in <a href="#mlpla000026.html">Bethelsdorf</a> to which I went. In this
            <sup>Choir</sup> House <sup>at</sup><a href="#mlpla000001.html">Hhuth</a> I learnt <br /> to know myself better, which has prov'd a wholesome school to me, &amp; for which I <br /> shall
         feel greatful to my latest breath. <em>March 1758</em> I was admitted among <br /> the Intercessors which <del>opportunities</del> has prov'd salutary &amp; blessed to me <br /> after which I
         liv'd 4 years in the Child<sup>rns</sup> Oeconomy &amp; then rec'd a call to <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a><br /> to be among the Child<sup>n</sup> there where, I also remain'd 4
         years, &amp; then came to live <br /> and the <a href=".html">C <sup>Choir</sup> House</a> here where, I have been ever since thousand, thousand <br /> thanks be rendered to my graciousLord

      <p><del>Continuation of the life of Sarah Gurney I have to add the
            following</del>: Since I came into the single sisters house <br /> at <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a> the Holy Ghost took me into his school, &amp; showed me that <br /> I ought to
         love our Saviour more than I did &amp; that I had not that earnest<br />desire which I should have for the manifestation of his love to me. Though <br /> he had followed me from my infancy,
         yet now he discovered my depravity <br /> poverty &amp; helplessness returning my abode in the sisters house in a particular <br /> manner, I was in darkness sometimes through unbelief &amp;
         the feeling of my <br /> misery, &amp; if it one not for his love &amp; pitty he would have taken his grace from</p>
      <p><br /> me but he did not, but from time to time helped me, letting me see clearly <br /> that without him there is no happiness, I felt my lost estate but he drew me <br /> near to himself
         &amp; did not let me rest till I could by faith apply his <sup>Atone</sup><br /> ments <sup>to myself</sup> &amp; know that I was his &amp; he was mine. If I had been <br /> more faithful to
         his leading I should have experienced more happiness &amp; have <br /> been more to his honor. I am still his poor child. I see &amp; feel my sinfulness <br /> &amp; that so very slowly
         toward the mark I press, but <a href=".html">Jesus</a>comforts me, who out <br />mercy free me all my guilt with patience in the accursed tree. Now my <br /> hearts inclination is a deep
         prostration for my Saviourspain, To be therby <br />melted so that each one felt it how I love that Man. May his love be <br /> be all my own &amp; may I in future love him with my whole
            heart<br /><del>from here to eternity</del> though I shall fall short in time &amp; eternity. I can <br /> never praise<sup>him</sup> sufficiently for what he has done to me his worthy
         child. <br /> His Holy Spirit often reproved <sup>me,</sup> but when with contrition I <sup>owned all</sup> to him, he <br />forgave me again, In short I live by his forgiveness. He <del>I
            was</del><sup>cared</sup> for me <br /> with <sup>the</sup>tenderness of a Mother. O that I could praise my heavenly Father and my <br />Saviour<del>&amp; I could</del> better than I do! O
         that I <del>did</del><sup>might</sup> never forget his mercies to me <br /><del>which alas I have often done</del><del>by he</del><sup>and tho' I have often to my great loss been forgetful,
            yet he</sup> my great Saviour still remained the same <br /> For <del>was</del><sup>which I now</sup> will praise him as well as I can, &amp; <del>will</del><sup>shall</sup> do it better
         when I see him. <br /><del>Thus far her own words, to which her Sisters added the following.</del></p>
