					<lb/>died Feb. / 48
					<lb/>Our late Sr Alice Catton was
					<lb/>bore at Hathwaite in Huddersf<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> in
					<lb/>Nov<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 1767, her parents being in
					<lb/>connection with the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rns</hi> church &amp; mem
					<lb/>bers of our Cog<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> at Mifield who enjoyed
					<lb/>the Grace of God in their hts. &amp; bro<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t.</hi> up their
					<lb/>childr<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> in the nuture &amp; admonit<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> of ye Ld so
					<lb/>that our late S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> knew the truth &amp; doubtless
					<lb/>felt powerful drawings of divine lore from
					<lb/>her early childhood. When ab<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t.</hi> 16 yrs of age,
					<lb/>she came to reside in it sisters house at
					<lb/>that time existing at Littlemoor in the
					<lb/>house now tenanted by M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Parkinson While
					<lb/>there she grew in grace &amp; in the knowledge
					<lb/>of our Ld. &amp; Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Jes. Christ, as her occasional
					<lb/>references in conversation, to that period
					<lb/>of her life, as a happy &amp; profitable one, proved.
					<lb/>In the y<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 1783 the establishme<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> at Littlemoor
					<lb/>being broken up, she removed with most of
					<lb/>her companions to our Sisters house here
					<lb/>having spent 8 years in the other institu
					<lb/>tion, &amp; having been, during that time, rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi>
					<lb/>into the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> &amp; admitted to the H. Com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi>. She
					<lb/>did not spend reside (in this Sisters&apos; house) for
					<lb/>the whole of her remaining time, but lived
					<lb/>some years with her late father, nursing him
					<lb/>faithfully until his end, in her native place
					<lb/>she was also a short time at Gumersal - lived with
					<lb/>a friend in a private house in Fulneck
					<lb/>&amp; likewise occupied another house by herself
					<lb/>she was for sometime cook in the Sisters
					<lb/>house, &amp; spent attasctory upwards of 50
					<lb/>years either in this or that at Littlemoor.
					<lb/>The fact, that throughout the whole of her
					<lb/>lengthened pilgrimmage of 4 score years she
					<lb/>maintained a consistent Moravian character
					<lb/>proves that she knew whom she believed,
					<lb/>that her love of Moravians constrained her, &amp; that
					<lb/>she walked humbly with her God. Tho&apos; not
					<lb/>so communicative &amp; open as some followers
					<lb/>of the Lamb on spiritual subjects, her

					<lb/>&amp; tender, as well as her walk conformable to
					<lb/>the gospel, showed that she was in Christ &amp; that
					<lb/>his spirit dwelt in her. Being, moreover of
					<lb/>a very cheerful, lively &amp; amiable disposition
					<lb/>she was generally beloved &amp; respected wherever
					<lb/>she dwelt &amp; by old &amp; young. Her course
					<lb/>temporal &amp; spiritual, was remarkably
					<lb/>smooth &amp; even; she had an excellent con
					<lb/>stitut<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> &amp; enjoyed very good health not
					<lb/>feeling much even of the infirmities of
					<lb/>old age &amp; being able often to attend the means
					<lb/>of grace in which she delighted finding in
					<lb/>these pastures for her soul. Nor had she
					<lb/>many trials, of an external nature, to
					<lb/>cope with; perhaps the heaviest was the loss
					<lb/>of her little property by the failure of a
					<lb/>bank in Halifax, at a time when such
					<lb/>a calamity must be peculiarly dis
					<lb/>tressing viz. where old-age was approaching
					<lb/>yet she submitted, taking the dispensation
					<lb/>as from the hands of the Lord, &amp; believing that
					<lb/>he would know how to provide for her; nor
					<lb/>was her confidence put to shame; he, who 
					<lb/>clothes the lilies &amp; feeds the ravens, found
					<lb/>her food &amp; raiment &amp; what adds so much
					<lb/>to those blessings a contented &amp; cheerful mind
					<lb/>until he took her to where the Lamb himself
					<lb/>shall feed his sheep &amp; guide them to living
					<lb/>fountains of water. She was attacked
					<lb/>by the then prevailing influenza ab<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> 2
					<lb/>mo<hi rend='superscript:true;'>s</hi> ago, &amp; was so much reduced, that she
					<lb/>quite expected to be called home to her
					<lb/>Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>; she recovered, however, once more so
					<lb/>for, as to have almost regained her wanted
					<lb/>strength; but on Friday Jan<hi rend='superscript:true;'>y</hi> 20<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> she
					<lb/>was taken ill of another complaint, which
					<lb/>presently reduced her so rapidly, that no
					<lb/>hopes could be entertained of her recovery. 
					<lb/>Throughout the whole of her illness she was
					<lb/>much pleased to enter into spiritual con
					<lb/>versat<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> with any spiritual believing friend, always
					<lb/>welcomed her labourer &amp; her minister, 
					<lb/>whom she had known from a little Boy, with
					<lb/>joy &amp; affection &amp; loved to have a prayer offered.

					<lb/>ed up at her side. When it became
					<lb/>evident, that her days were numbered , &amp;
					<lb/>she was asked, if she herself tho<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>
					<lb/>would at this time take her to himself,
					<lb/>she said at first with the utmost calm
					<lb/>ness, &quot;It is not yet clear to me,&quot; but after
					<lb/>a day or two, she said decidedly, &quot;I know
					<lb/>not that I <hi rend='underlined:true;'>am</hi> going,&quot; adding that she
					<lb/>knew her Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, in whom she had so long be
					<lb/>lieved, who had led her from her youth
					<lb/>up &amp; shewn her never varying loving
					<lb/>kindness, could now complete His work
					<lb/>&amp; crown His Grace for that tho&apos; she was
					<lb/>a poor worthless sinner in herself, He had
					<lb/>washed her from sins in his own blood
					<lb/>&amp; would, she assuredly believed, fully pre
					<lb/>pare her, by His spirit for entering into
					<lb/>his kingdom &amp; seeing Him face to face.
					<lb/>She spoke with true humility of herself
					<lb/>as of one who had not a crumb of merit
					<lb/>no, not <hi rend='underlined:true;'>one</hi> righteous work to plead;
					<lb/>but she extolled the all sufficiency, the
					<lb/>grace, the tender loving kindness of her
					<lb/>Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> as her <hi rend='underlined:true;'>All</hi>. A friend observing to her
					<lb/>one day in conversation, &quot;You have
					<lb/>had a smooth &amp; even course thro&apos; time,&quot;
					<lb/>she replied: &quot;Indeed I have, tho&apos; not quite
					<lb/>without troubles, which we must all
					<lb/>share, I have indeed been most justly
					<lb/>led, even to heavy heirs. Her very looks
					<lb/>beamed for the the calm serenity of her
					<lb/>soul, &amp; whenever she was asked if
					<lb/>she still felt our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> peace in her
					<lb/>soul, &amp; felt her reply was an empha
					<lb/>tic &quot;Yes!&quot; she stated too, that no doubts
					<lb/>or fears even of a transiently disturbed her
					<lb/>peace &amp; joy in believing. Up to last sa
					<lb/>turday, tho&apos; occasionally rambling she
					<lb/>was able to understand &amp; answer ques
					<lb/>tions, but on Lords day morning all con

					<lb/>sciousness seemed to be gone &amp; she
					<lb/>lay perfectly quiet till ab<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t.</hi> 6 o&apos;clock
					<lb/>in the evening when she breathed her
					<lb/>last in the most gentle manner, &amp;
					<lb/>without even a sigh, at the age of 80
					<lb/>years &amp; about 10 weeks. Thus her last
					<lb/>end was peace, &amp; she sleeps in Jesus.
