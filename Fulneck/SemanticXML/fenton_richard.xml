					<p> The Course of Life, of the <roleName type="honorific">great Boy</roleName>
						<persName ref="#mlper000556"><hi rend="underline">Rich<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Fenton</hi></persName> who departed <date type="death" when-iso="1772-12-29">Dec. 29

					<p>
						<persName ref="#mlper000556">Rich<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Fenton</persName>, Son of our <roleName type="honorific">Br</roleName>
						<persName>Richd Fenton</persName> was born the <date type="birth" when-iso="1757-05-16">16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May 1757</date> at <placeName>Pudsey</placeName>, in
						the <placeName>Parish of Calverly</placeName>. As a Child he went to the <placeName>B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> School</placeName> at <placeName>Lane End</placeName> where
						he learn&apos;d till he was <date when-iso="1769" cert="medium">12 Years old</date>. In <date when-iso="1769-06">June 1769</date> he was bound <name occupation="apprentice"
							>Apprentice</name> to <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<persName>John Spicer</persName> to learn the <name occupation="glover">Glover&apos;s Business</name> &amp; came at the same time to live in the <placeName>Choir
							House</placeName>, where he went on in a still &amp; quiet Course to the Satisfaction of his <orgName>Brn</orgName> In the following Year he <name health="disease">began to
							be sickly</name>, &amp; as all endeavours for his recovery proved ineffectual, <name health="disease">he grew weaker &amp; weaker from time to time</name> &amp; as his
						Parents lived near, it was propos&apos;d to him to go and live with them whereby he might enjoy more of their Parental Care &amp; Nursing; but he declin&apos;d it. However as
						he grew more helpless, he, in the <date when="1772-06">beginning of last July</date>, agreed to go &amp; be with his Parents, where he has enjoyed a happy &amp; sabbatical time
						waiting with Patience &amp; Resig. nation when it would please our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> to take him into his eternal Joy &amp; Security. He was now
						&amp; then visited by the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> to whom he declared that altho&apos; he was resigned to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> yet he know that it would be better for him to be with <persName type="deity">Christ</persName>, than to recover <note
							type="catchword">his</note>

					<p> his Health, &amp; live here still longer. He had an Impression of our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>&apos;s love towards him, which made him look &amp; pray to
						our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> with Confidence. When he was visited by <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> whom he was accquainted with, he
						desired that they might sign sing some Verses with him, &amp; several Times he mentioned in particular that the following should be sung: I am a poor Sinner, yes &apos;tis true
						I am &amp;c. He came here to the Meetings as long as he was able to walk, or ride, which always seem&apos;d to be a refreshment to him, &amp; when he was no more able to come
						to the meetings, he was <add place="above">very</add> Sorry for it, especially when he thought that he should not have the pleasure to attend the meetings on <name
							type="holiday">Christmas Eve</name>, on which account he propos&apos;d that a couple of <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> should earry him to the
							<placeName>Hall</placeName> in a Sedan; But on the <date when-iso="1772-12-19">19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></date> in the Night, he
						had such a gracious visit of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> that he became quite satisfied, with his not being able to come to the
						meetings on <name type="holiday">Christmas Eve</name>, for when he got up in the Morning &amp; dressed himself he began to speak to his Mother about it &amp; told her there had
						happened an alteration with him last Night when she asked what way, he told her that our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<note type="catchword">had</note>
					</p>
					<pb />
					<p> had been very <add place="above">near</add> to him &amp; he had kept a band with him about every thing, &amp; our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName> had forgiven him all &amp; would take him soon to himself. He also said: &quot;I gave myself quite anew to our <roleName type="honorific"
							>Saviour</roleName>, &amp; he accepted me as his own Child, Believing his time would be short, he desired that his <roleName type="honorific">Srs</roleName> in the
							<placeName>Choir House</placeName> might be sent for, to tell them how happy our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> had made him, &amp; that he would soon take
						him to himself to be happy &amp; to live with him forever. Since this time <name health="disease">he grew weaker so fast</name>, that one could see the time of his Departure
						came on very quickly. Some Days before his going home, his Master came to see him, &amp; when he was going to leave him, he reached his hand to his Master &amp; thanked him for
						all the love &amp; favours he had shewn to him, telling him he very likely might never see him any more in this World, &amp; so it came to pass, for on <date type="death"
							when-iso="1772-12-29">Decr 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, 1772</date> in the Moming his Soul took its Flight, to that God, who had created &amp; redeemed him &amp; made
						him so happy by his precious Nearness, in the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year of his Age. </p>
