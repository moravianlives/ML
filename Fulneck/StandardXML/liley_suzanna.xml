					<lb />In y<hi rend='superscript:true;'>e</hi> year 41 her parents got acquainted with ye Brn
					<lb />And she also went to hear them altho at that time
					<lb />She had not much feeling of her heart till in ye year
					<lb />42 when She got a real desier in her heart, after our Savior
					<lb />And to know her Election of Grace in his Wounds
					<lb />Apri 25 1745
					<lb />in ye year 44 there was the first Regulation, of Class&apos;s made,
					<lb />This proved to her a gret blessing; and She went on very happly some time
					<lb />but She being of a curious turn of mind, and Loveing to prey into
					<lb />matters, at one time She got in to Some Conversation with a
					<lb />Sertain person, which proved some what hurtful to her
					<lb />But however; She soon got helped; for her Natural Disposs
					<lb />on, was very upright, so that She always spoke her mind just
					<lb />as it was to those who had ye Care of her,
					<lb />in the same year She was Rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ed</hi> in to the Congregation, She now
					<lb />thought She was out of all danger and that nothing more
					<lb />Could happen to her, wereby She came into acertain dryness
					<lb />for some time, which proved very heavey to her; as She was very
					<lb />upright an Conscientious; wch was thought that her being mad[e]
					<lb />a pertaker of the holy Sacrament, might prove the mens of
					<lb />bringing her in that right Course of Grace, which She her
					<lb />self as well as her Labours, percived was yet a wanting

					<lb />did not take the wishd for Affect
					<lb />Therebeing at that time an EOconemy at Oxhayes She earnestly
					<lb />desierd to go to it, beliveing that it would prove a blessing
					<lb />to her heart; In June, there was an EOconemy began at Home
					<lb />when she According to her Ernest, desier, went into that EOconemy
					<lb />with Several more Sisters, as to her out ward behaviour She
					<lb />was unblammable, but through drynes of heart, She was Still
					<lb />keept back from going on in that happy Corse of Grace
					<lb />which She other wise might;
					<lb />in May 46 or there was some alterrations made in ye<hi rend='superscript:true;'> </hi>EOconomy&apos;s

					<lb />her a deep and Lasting impression of his death and 
					<lb />Sufferings, which He soon granted, a great Charge
					<lb />was then Wrought in hers which was very descernable
					<lb />to all who Coversd with her, &amp; When She was spoke
					<lb />with her the following Lord supper it was to the Mutual
					<lb />Satisfaction of her self and her Labourer, it was then
					<lb />Alowed her to go again to the holy Sacrament; to which
					<lb />She had not been Admitted for some time, but on Accont
					<lb />of some Smal Circumstance. She Chose rather to desir
					<lb />all of time following; what our Saviour tho granted
					<lb />her to enjoy proved such a blessing to her heart which she 
					<lb />Cou&apos;d never forget; and which She related with many tears
					<lb />of joy about a fort Night before her happy dissolution
					<lb />from this time forward She went on in at interrupted Course
					<lb />of Grace;
