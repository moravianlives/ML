Bretheren, which made her leave her place that she might
have opportunity to hear the Gosple & thereupon she came
live with Br & Sr Ager at Northampton, where from time
to time she became Acquainted with the Srs of her own Choir
by whom she was very much Belov'd but cou'd not according to 
her Satisfaction to enjoy her own Choir, to whom she was so
much attach'd yet her heart was always with them. She long was
usefull in the Service of Br & Sr Ager & at the same time
under great obligations to them, since they was the cause of her be-
ing acquainted with the Congregation, She always show'd great Ten-
derness and affection in her Childlike behaviour to them. in

which proved a great blessing to her & She kept in close union
with her Srs came as often as She cou'd to Bedford it being
a great way of which gave her great reason to wish & long to

often said if I dont soon come to my dear Srs I believe our
Saviour will take me to himself, which she often expressd
to her Choir Labouress, this last year the found it very
difficult in coming to see us the Small-Pox being in
Northampton, which She had not had gave her great reason
to Stay at home, on which account She shed many tears &
sent Letters to her Srs to let them know from time to time
how she felt in her heart & so kept up fellowship with them.

about her illness on which account Lorel went the 14th of
June, & arriv'd with her at 11 o clock. at the sight of her
She was over-come with joy, & embrac'd her to such a degree
that She was advis'd to keep still, least it might hurt her
O no said She, I am so glad to see you nothing will hurt me
how Shall I be thaakfull enough to my dear Saviour for
such a grace, tho' I have nothing to say in particular but
to tell you that I am quite ready to go to my dear Savr
whom I love very much, I am over come with his grace; he is
so near to me that I can embrace him at any time, after
She had repeated often how glad & thankfull she was in see-
ing one of her Choir Sisters She seem'd to grow weak
Lorel was left alone with her asking her many questions
& if She thought of going soon to embrace her Bridegroom,
yes said She, it was made out in my heart before now;
but since I ses you I cant recollect so well, I am quite resin'd
& believe it will be soon, then Lorel said to her it will be the 
more joy to you when you get the sight of him sooner then you
expected upon which She smil'd was quite Chearfull & taken up
entirely with her Bridegroom, After this uncommon joy she
seem'd tir'd then Lorel left her but She soon sent for her
again, she found her in her the same chearfull way, & Sung
several verses asking then if she understood what was sung
She said I Sing with you we then percievd a Suden alteration
the Person which attended her wanted to ease her turn'd her
on her Bed but not expecting that her time was so near.
She looking at Lorel who began to sing & her Poor Limbs now
dying &c under which verse her Soul took its flight about 7 o Clock
the Same Night, all those about her was agreeable surpris'd at her
happy departure.
