					The life of the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">le</hi> Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ann Kellet who departed
					to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> in the Choirhouse at Fulneck Jan<hi rend="superscript:true;">y</hi> 5<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi>
					1788. She has left the following account of herself.
				</p>
			<p>
					I was born at Whibsey in the Parish of Bradford
					Yorkshire, March 21<hi rend="superscript:true;">st</hi> 1745, as soon as I was able
					my Parents sent me to School which was then kept
					by the Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> at Scoles and Horton, and I had a great
					pleasure in it, but the first real feeling I remember
					to have had, was when B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. Gross had the care of the
					Children, when he came his round, he kept us a
					meeting, and told us that on such a day in the next
					week at Lambs-Hill there woud be a Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>. day 
					for Child<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>., which he had wish'd for many Years.
					telling us how he wish'd us to spend our time till
					then, asuring us that our Saviour would bless us
					in a particular manner, I longed for the time to come
					as I expected something particular and was not
					dissappointed, it was the first time I had been at
					such a meeting, we Country Child<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>. were in the Gallerry, the discourse was kept by B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. Tranecker, 
					during which I remember my heart was quite
					overcome with the feeling, I pray'd our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. to 
					bless me, tho' I did not think myself to worthy as
					those who were below, but He was very near me.
					I long'd afterwards for these Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>. days to come.
					When I was reciev'd amongst the Great Girls

					my whole wish was to prosper for our Saviour and I 
					felt a desire to go and live with the Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>. which lasted
					till a Cousin I had who went to live with the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi>.
					soon left them again, and as I know he went with a 
					full intention to stay with them, it put such a damp 
					upon me, that I gave it up, thinking that I might perhaps do as he had done. My Parents spoke to me in a 
					very close manner, and told me never to think of going
					if I thought of acting in the same way, but instead of
					this proving a blessing, it harden'd my heart, and I did
					my best to stifle all convictions, I went on this wicked
					way for near a Year, till I cou'd hold it out no longer, I 
					then made a full resolution to leave all, let the consequence
					be as they wou'd. My Parents were exceedingly pleas
					with this, and did to the utmost of their power to get
					my things in readiness against my removal, which 
					took place Oct<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 23<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> 1761, when I mov'd into the Choir
					House at Fulneck, my Mother accompanied me, but on
					seeing her so concern'd for fear of my not praying, affect
					me very much, but I soon got to be at home amongst the 
					S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>. tho' one thing always put a damp upon me, which
					was that I was not sure of my Salvation. Jan<hi rend="superscript:true;">y</hi> 1<hi rend="superscript:true;">st</hi>, 1762
					I was receiv'd into the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>. quite unexpectedly, but
					instead of this being a pleasure, it was a pain to me, as I 
					secretly wish'd it not to take place till I knew for certain
					that my sins were forgiven, now I had no more rest, think
					I wou'd neither eat nor sleep, till I had attain'd it, as at
				
			</p>
			<cb />
			<p>
				
					time I thought it was all fancy, I went on in this way
					for a whole Year unti Dec<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 19<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi>, when B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. LaTrobe
					preach'd a sermon, and took his text out of the Song
					of Solomon, where our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. is describ'd as a Roe or a
					Young Hart, he first treated of the swiftness of them
					and likened them to the haste which our Saviour makes
					to any poor Soul in distress, whilst he was speaking I 
					felt so overcome that it is impossible to express what I 
					felt in those moments, when I came a little to myself, 
					having my Hymn book on my lap, it came into my
					mind to open a verse for myself, which was Jesus my
					Bridegroom my soul is - To thee already joined &amp;c. what 
					I felt at the reading of this is impossible to describe, it 
					was as if our Saviour spoke every word of it Himself
					and I had never heard the verse before, I was so happy, 
					and felt that such a change had taken place, that I cou'd
					hardly believe what had happen'd to me, being once in
					my Class, my Labouress (who I believe had a mind to 
					try my faith) said she had a question to ask me, adding
					Our Saviour will know if it is so, and the Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> shall be
					witnesses, the question was, whether I had felt our
					Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>. forgiveness? I told her I knew I had as clearly as
					I knew when the sun shone, but I know I must have
					it daily renew'd, she answer'd me with those words, that
					For without fresh supplies - the former droops and dies
					Continually we've need. By faith on Him to feel. This
					made me reason a little, why she should ask me first a
					question but my faith failed not. In the year 1760 I had

					the grace and favour of being receiv'd into the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">le</hi>. Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>.
					Choir, which has prov'd a real blessing to me, the reception
					meeting in particular, B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> LaTrobe sung that verse, Where
					agonizing Blood - The reeking earth did cover - There
					each unlamblike though - Shall be interr'd forever.
					after these words he kneel'd down, and pray'd very affect
					ingly that every thing displeasing to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. might be
					remov'd before we enter'd into a new Choir, when he rose
					up from prayer he sung, Henceforth they'll move no where
					This made such an impression upon me, that I wish'd with
					my whole heart that this might be my case. At this
					time a new school began to take place in my heart, and
					those things which before seem'd not of much consequence
					to me, now appear'd as great Sins, I thought at this time
					that if I disclos'd my mind to anyone, I shou'd not have
					the favour to stay any longer in the House, and pray'd
					our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. earnestly to help me without opening my mind,
					a Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. in the Room, seeing the distress I was in, spoke
					to me in a tender manner, and gave me to understand
					<add place="above">that</add> She had expereinc'd the same, and advis'd me to speak
					my mind to my Labouress, but being of a very close turn, 
					I still cou'd not do it, one day when I cou'd hear it no
					longer, I went alone, and there pray'd our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. to help me
					I open'd that verse, Can any ill distress my heart - Since
					God with his own Son did part - Whate'er I want can't be
					deny'd - Because for me the Saviour dy'd. Then I saw
					clearly that no ill need distrress me, for by my Saviours
					Birth and Sufferings He had purchas'd all things for
				
			</p>
			<cb />
			<p>
				
					me, and wou'd not deny me any thing, now I cou'd speak
					openheartedly to my Labouress about every thing. Aug<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi>
					13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> the same Year I was made <add place="above">became</add> a Candidate for the 
					Holy Comunion during the Sacrament, the pouring out 
					of the Wine and singing that verse How in this Hall
					with haste - That thy Church met it render &amp;c. I 
					felt in my heart as if it really was so; afterwards
					I waited with ardent longing for the time to come when
					I shou'd enjoy it, which favour was granted me the 
					4<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> of May following, but I did not feel so well as I 
					cou'd have wish'd being very timerous, and wanting
					to enjoy something so very extraordinary, not expect
					ing that at such a time one bad thought shou'd arise after
					another; but I found by experience that they were some
					times more ripe then, than at any other time, and I
					felt so many things stirring from time to time; but our
					Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. gave me to feel that there was no occasion for me
					to be a shame to sin of any kind, as in Him there was
					full santification. In the Year 1767 it pleas'd our
					Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. to take my dear Parents home to himself, also my 
					B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. and S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. in a few weeks who left 3 Child<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> Orphans
					we were in the greatest distress how they shou'd be 
					cared for, but our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. according to his promise has
					cared for them all, but taking the youngest to himself
					and the other two are now in Gomersal Oeconomy.
					In the Year 1768 when the Unitys Elders Conference
					was here, I serv'd in the kitchen during their stay

			<p>
				
					and after they were gone, I was desir'd Serve in the 
					Child<hi rend="superscript:true;">rns</hi> work which at first for several reasons was
					not agreable to me, but it prov'd a School for my heart
					and made me keep close to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> so that I can truly 
					say 5 Years I liv'd there form'd a real blessing for
					my heart, especially the Child<hi rend="superscript:true;">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> days, which remind
					my Childrens Years to me. After that I return'd into
					the Choir house, where I was employed in the Wash for
					12 Years. As for those latter Years, I am at a loss
					what to say, and cannot express what our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> has been
					to me, but so far I am joy. He has taught me to know
					what his in human nature, and other human weak
					nesses are, together with what He can be to a poor distress
					ed Soul, for I often thought I was like God, and had to
					weep the bitterest tears, on account of my thinking too
					much of certain circumstances that occurred to me, that
					He never faild to comfort me in a most striking manner
					by passages of Scripture just so. Are not true Sinners
					Sold for a farthing, and not one of them shall fall to the
					ground without my heavenly Fathers knowledge, fear
					ye not therefore, for the very Hairs of your Head are
					all remeber'd. Amidst all reasonings I cou'd also believe
					what that verse expresses, How well O Lord art thou thy 
					People leading - Tho' oft thy ways seem wonderfull and
					Strange. There can be nothing wrong in thy proceeding
					Because thy faithfulness can never change - Thy ways
					are often crooked and yet Straight - In which thy
				
			</p>
			<cb />
			<p>
				
					Children are ordain'd to walk-- Tho' all to ruin
					seems to go and waste - As his to ?? ??? thou art
					wise and great. And now I hope our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> will grant
					me patience to wait his time, untill He shall please to
					call me home to Himself, then I shall be able to praise
					him better for all that He has done for me.
				</p>
			<p>
					So for our late Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> on account.
				</p>
			<p>
					What she writes concerning those last Years is in
					reference to her receving a Call in the year 1784 to
					serve our Saviour in Barbados, which she ????
					accepted but no for account of circumstances) it was
					afterwards found good to postpone the matter for
					sometime, it prov'd a great trial to her, and she took
					it much to heart, which so far impair'd her health
					that (tho' it was still kept in view for her) it now
					no less oblig'd to be entirely drop't But as she
					herself how briefly noted how she felt in those circum
					stances, will only further mention that in her last
					sickness, which from what time now gradually, ???
					ing, and at last terminated in a Consumption, our
					Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> was particularly gracious to her, and enabled
					her to resign everything chearfully into his faith
					full hands, whenever she spoke of her own hearts
					feeling it was always in the most gratefull tone, that 
					She loved her help'd thro' so well, for said she, when I 
					look my whole course ever, I see abundance of greatness 
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_17_KelletAnn-05.jpg" n="5" />
			<p>
				
					and mercy which our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. has always shown towards
					<hi rend="underlined:true;">me his poor one</hi>, for which I shall remain a debtor
					to all eternity. the Joy she felt at of the prospect of
					soon seeing him on whom she had believ'd while here,
					was visible <add place="above">evident</add> in every conversation with her, and her
					confidece in our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. remain'd unshaken.
				</p>
			<p>
					January 5<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi>, early in the morning, it was evident
					that her time here wou'd not be long, upon which
					the last blessing of the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>. and her Choir was im
					parted to her, during which she was quite sensible 
					and herself had signify'd that a Liturgy shoud be kept
					by her, which was attended with an awefull feeling
					of the near presense of our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. and of what came to
					pass in those moments, for, during the same, she fell
					happily asleep in Him, having spent here below
					43 Years, 11 weeks wanting.
