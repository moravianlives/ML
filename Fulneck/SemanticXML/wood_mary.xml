					<lb />I was Born in Gloslop Parish near Hayfeld in Darbisher Aprell
					<lb />ye> 6 1729 My Parints being Church pepell &amp; endevered to being us up
					<lb />for the Lord and endeverd to keep us from worly Company as far as they
					<lb />Could, My Mother ust often tell us of our Sav, at the time when I got the Smallpox
					<lb />I was so ill that I was given up by the Doctor my father asked me if I could
					<lb />Like to go to our Sav I Sade yes for I felt Somthing of our Savs love in my
					<lb />Heart, but I soon recovered again, In the year 1732 David Talor Came
					<lb />about a preaching My Father and mother went to hear him &amp; took me
					<lb />with them which I liked soon after M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Inrom came his preaching I liked
					<lb />Still better for I now felt that I wanted somthing for my Heart, In a short
					<lb />time after ye Brethen came and Settell a Laity at our House which gave us
					<lb />an oppertunity to speak to them about our Hearts which often proved a Comfort
					<lb />and Consolation to me at that time, in ye year 1736 I Came the first time to
					<lb />Yorkhir I had the pleasur of geting Acquainted with Some of ye Sisters they took
					<lb />me to the econimy in pudsy for a few Days were I had some Conversation with
					<lb />Ann Burkbe &amp; Sis Clacket the latter asked me if I was Resolved to be our Sav &amp;
					<lb />live for him I told her that it was my whole intention so to do She spoke to me of
					<lb />our Sav, love to poor Sinners which made a deep impression on my heart
					<lb />the fellowship which I injoyed with ye Sisters &amp; Blessed feeling I had of the place
					<lb />made me think that Lambshill was a heaven upon earth which Caused me much
					<lb />pain to Leave it, Some day after I got to my father I begun to grow more and
					<lb />more unesy &amp; distress in my mind I ust to go by myself into the feld and prayed
					<lb />our Sav, that he would let me feell his Grace as I found that I had no lasting
					<lb />satisfaction in any thing but our Sav was pleased to draw nigh to my Heart which
					<lb />proved a real comfort to me thus I went on for Some time in a Chearfull
					<lb />way being our Sav to preserve me from day to day for I felt that in myself I was
					<lb />a poor and good for nothing Creater, when Bro &amp; Sis Heakerwelder Came to
					<lb />Care for the plan in Duckinfeild I gained much Confidence to them both &amp;
					<lb />Could Acquaint them with every thing which opprest my mind, in ye year 1748 our Sav
					<lb />was pleased to Call my Mother to himself which went very near me for I loved
					<lb />her exceedingly she comforted us in the Best Manner and Assured us that our
					<lb />Sav and his dear Congreation would know Better how to Care for us then She had
					<lb />done her last words were I am quite Ready to go to my dearist Bridegroom
					<lb />which had a very Blessed effect on my Mind from this time on I felt a real
					<lb />Desire in my heart to become a member of the Congreation in ye year 50 on
					<lb />ye 13 of June our Sav granted me my Requste to be Reciveed which unexpected
					<lb />Grace and faviour bowed me in the dust at the feet of my Dearist Bridegroom
					<lb />In the same year I was made a Candiate for the holy Sacreament and was
					<lb />confirmed at Christmas which Grace I cannot express in words but my being
					<lb />So far a distance from the Congreation delayed my going to the Communing for
					<lb />Sometime Longer it however brought me into a Close and Strick exsamanation
					<lb />in my own heart and one Day as I was walking alone by myself in the feilds
					<lb />Medeatating what a grate matter it was to go to the holy Sacreament and that no
					<lb />one Could Injoy it right but such as Could know that there Sins was

					<lb />Forgiven them by our Sav and thou Hearts washed in his Blood, but I
					<lb />found that it was not so with me it brought me into great perplexity of
					<lb />mine which I strove to hide from my Father &amp; Sis, I felt a great inclination
					<lb />to be allways by myself Sometimes thoughts would arise in my Mind as if
					<lb />our Sav did not like to have any thing to do with me; my Misry daly increased
					<lb />so that I thought that I Should never come thro feeling very much destress
					<lb />In my Soul I retired into a room were I prostrated and prayed our dear
					<lb />Saviour that he would be pleased to Manifest himself to my poor Heart
					<lb />in that figure were in for all my Need he did die on the Cross for poor me
					<lb />I was Cheared &amp; Comforted by the greatious Absolutison which I Recved as a
					<lb />poor pardon Sinner which Melted me like wax before my only Machless
					<lb />Heart whose thro bored feet I kiss and weted with many a thankfull Tear
					<lb />beging that he would keep me as a poor Child that had no dependance but
					<lb />on him alone in ye year 1751 Aprell 16 I had the unspeakabell
					<lb />Grace and faviour to pertake for the First time of our Sav Corps &amp;
					<lb />Blood in the holy Commuion which day I Shall never forget it was
					<lb />to me as if our Sav was Bodly present in the Congreation, I retured
					<lb />home again with a Heart throly thankfull for what I had injoyed
					<lb />But being Convinced in my own heart that I was not as yet in that pleace
					<lb />which our Sav had called me too My desive to live with the Sis grew more &amp;
					<lb />more stronge and after Coming again to Yorkshir I Spoke to Sis Mary about
					<lb />Coming to live with the Sisters in the econimy but she desired me to be
					<lb />Sattisfyed till Surcumstance would make it so that and My Sis Ester Could
					<lb />Both Could Come at a time and assured me that we should not be unforgoten
					<lb />but Cared for as well as if we lived amongst them, in the same year it was
					<lb />thought well by the Brethen for my father to be Married again which gave
					<lb />me and My Sis some hope of our going to live at lambshill, we Both made
					<lb />our desire known to Sis Mary in wrighten and got leave to Come as soon as
					<lb />we Could make it possabell in ye year 1752 in September the long wished for
					<lb />time came when Both I and My Sis came to live with the Sisters in the
					<lb />Econimy were we was Reced amongst them with much love which put us
					<lb />quite to Shame Sis Mary acquainted me that my Sis would stay in the ecominy
					<lb />at lambshill and for me to go to that ecominy at the tiersellhall which I felt to
					<lb />be quite sattifed with I soon found myself at home amongst them and
					<lb />injoyed much Grace and happiness in that place when the quire house
					<lb />was Finished I amonget the rest got leave to move into it which I
					<lb />esteemed a grate Grace and faviour for which I could never be thankfull
					<lb />Enofe to our dear Sav for I beged My dearist Bridegroom very tenderly
					<lb />that he world make me a obbedent good Child according to his heart and
					<lb />mind So that he could obtain his full aime with me in every respect for I
					<lb />felt that it was a new Scoul for my heart werein I had much to Larn

					<lb />everyday what poor Creater I was in myself and in how much need I stood of our
					<lb />Sav reaching in my heart being Masterly of a Close dispositson and unremovable
					<lb />In my own way of thinking and lacking the occation that the Sister was after obblige
					<lb />to reprove me which I did not take well of them alltho I Spoke as littell against it
					<lb />as posiabell yet in my heart I had not that true Sinnerlike feeling which I
					<lb />beleved that the rest of my Sisters did injoy and on account of this I felt often
					<lb />unesy and keept many a hearty Band with my Best beloved friend which was
					<lb />pleased to Show me my falts by Name and comforted me about it in a unspea
					<lb />kabell Mannar 
				</p>
				<p>
					<lb />I soon began to grow Sickly got a pain in my Side and by a Rumactket dissoder in my Back
					<lb />was rended in some Measure unabell for my work which Caused a Certain
					<lb />Fretfullness in my mind all posiabell means was used to get me some help
					<lb />yet to very lettell efect Sis Mary advised me to go for a short time home to my
					<lb />Father to see if the Change of the air would do me good but after a true
					<lb />consideration about it I found no liberty in my heart for it I therefore beged
					<lb />to be excuse as I had the assurance from our Sav that I was in the right pleace
					<lb />which he had alloted for me I did address myself to the freind of poor needy
					<lb />Sinners and prayed him to stand by me and help me thro tell he had prepared me
					<lb />for himself in ye year 1753 when Anna Jona pade a viset in Yorkshire She
					<lb />Spoke to all the Sisters and I had likewise had the Sattifaction to keep a hearty Band with
					<lb />her which proved a grate Blessing for my heart, in the year 1754 to we had the pleasure
					<lb />and satifaction to see our dear Papar &amp; Mamaen amongst we which happy and Blessed
					<lb />time will never be forgoten by me and what I felt and injoyed at that cause most memorabell
					<lb />Choir Sacrament and foot washing, cant express in Words O how was I struck when was made
					<lb />acquainted that I was to be one of that number I could hardly contain for Shame
					<lb />and thankfullness to think that our Sav Should Chuse me one of the poorist and the 
					<lb />unworthist of them all I devoted myself anew to the Bridegroom of my Soul to live for
					<lb />him in this world and I will kiss his bored Feet in Eternity for all what I
					<lb />have injoyed from him when I look back and consider the Manifold Graces and
					<lb />Blessings which he has been pleased to bestow on me the poorist of all and yea what
					<lb />Love and patiance he has shown to his poor helpless Child it bows me in the dust with
					<lb />a heart full of Gratitude and my whole wish is to keep my eye fixt upon his Marterd
					<lb />Pirson so that nothing May come betwen him and me. So far her own words
				</p>
				<p>
					<lb />Our haply Departed Sis was In Ganrall of a still &amp; quiet disposion one
					<lb />that never made much show with what our Sav did intrust her with
					<lb />but past on her time in a Childlike and happy Mannar Reling as a
					<lb />poor sinner on her hearts Best freind to whome She had devoted her self
					<lb />with Soul &amp; Body to become an intire Joy to him and his dear Congreation
					<lb />She often spoke to her Labours with an only tender feeling about the injoyment
					<lb />of the Choir and Choir Grace and what She had felt and experance in her own
