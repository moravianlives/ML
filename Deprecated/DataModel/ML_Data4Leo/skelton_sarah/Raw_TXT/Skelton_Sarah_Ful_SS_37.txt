The course of life of the S. Sr Sarah Skelton who departed
to our Savr May 3 1778 in the Sisr House at Fulneck
she has felt the following accont of hersilf. 
I was born at Robert Town in the parish of Burstoll,
Yorkshire and baptiz'd in the Ch: of Eng: in my 5th year
my Mother departed this life, my Father being left with 
5 small Children, sent me to live with one of my
relations; and remov'd himself with the rest of the Family
to Pudsey: in about a year after, he took one home again
that I might have the oppertunity with the rest of the Children
to go to the meetings at Fulneck, which I did with great
pleasure for a time when I was about 10 years ould, I begun
to love the things of this world, and forgot in a great measure
what I had heard of our Savr in the meetings. I then left my
Father, and went to service: which indeed prov'd hurtfull
to me being led by others into very bad things, and foll
owing at the same time my own evil inclinations, but
my faithfull Saviour kept a gracious eye over me, and
let me feel, that if I went on in this way I shou'd be 
lost forever. My Mrs with whome I liv'd, did not like
me to go to the meetings, but I intreated her one day very
earnestly, she gave me leave, I then went to my Father
and laid my case before him, and tould him, I could live
there no longer, disireing him to take me home again, 
which he did: I then cou'd go to the meetings at Fulne
of which I was very glad in my 13th yr I was receivd into 
the G: Girls Choir and from that time our Savr begun
a new work of Grace in my heart, he let me feel what
a poor lost creature I was by nature, I wept for grace


and wanted to be his intirely, I soon got a strong desire to 
go and live with the Sisrs, but durst not make it known,
thinking I was too bad; but when I cou'd conceal it no longer
I ventured to tell my Father, he gave me no incouragement
at all: but as I cou'd not give it up, I speak to my Labouress
about it, who promisd not to forget me as it was a 
good while before I got leave to go, and I was weak and 
unsteady in mysilf; the things of this world took again
hold of me, and provd a temptation to me in many
respects but my dear Savr never left me, but let me
feel I was not right, and causd me to be very uneasy
about my poor Soul, so that I coud do nothing but pray
him to make out a way for any escape, from the many
snares and temptation which were in my way.
March 25th 1770 I obtaind leave to go and live with
the S. Srs at Gumersall, for which I was very thank
full, and now it was my only desire to prosper in the
Congr to learn more of mysilf an also to become more
acquainted with our Savr. Febr 23d 1772 I had the
favour to be recievd into the Congr which was a great
comfort to me. May 4th 1773 I was receivd into the S 
Srs Choir; this change prov'd both a blessing and a 
of heart to me, I felt more of my corrupted state
by nature, but being very close, and not willing to 
be known as I really was: hinderd our Savr work 
in my heart, yet I felt him constantly busy to 
bring me to the knowledge of himsilf as the Found
of poor sinners, but instead of coming to him


as a poor Sinner, I stood looking at mysilf so long till
my misery became greater, it was to me as if all the sins I
had ever been guilty of, were laid before my eyes, and I 
became quite dark and perplex'd: and thought I had better
leave the Congn then be known just as I was; for I thought, 
certainly no one has ever been like me, when I wou'd have
turnd to our Savr it was as if something stood between, so
that I knew not which way to turn for relief for my poor
distressed Soul. Novr 28th 1773 I had the favour to be a 
spectator at the H: Comunion: which I took as a proof
of our Savrs love to me, that I might know he had not
forgot me; even when I thought I was forsaken of all, 
and what a feeling I had of his precious nearness
during that transaction, I can never describe in words;
this encoraged me so that I coud go on chearfull for some
time, but the feeling of my misery still oppressd me,
for it was nor made quite dear to me that I had hinder'd
our Savrs work by my own striving, and silf? working, at
the time when he wanted to bring one to a clearness in
him and I felt (by the fresh discovery he gave me of my
great misery and wretchedness) that he was now quite
intent to do it, and as I cou'd now do no otherwise, I disclosd
my whole heart to my Labouress; whome I found so tender
and sympathizing that I was quite asham'd. sometime after
having not yet feelt our Savrs forgiveness I came into
darkness and confusion about it, and was not without
thoughts of leaving the Congn being continually distress
on account of my many sins, which I longd to have
blotted out: and be absolvd from. 


in this longing disposition I once retird alone, and prostrated before
our Savr and he appear'd before me in that bleeding figure as he
hang upon the Cross, and gave me the asureance that he had
forgiven one all my sins, this was a comfort which no words
can describe; thus I became chearfull and was thankfull for 
what I had injoyd. and I feelt an inexpressabel desire to be a
participant of the H: Communion, which grace I was made
a pertakes off, Feby 18th 1776 to my great joy, from this time
I gave mysilf up intirely to our Savr, and wish'd for nothing so
much as to live in a close connesion with him, till I shall see
him face to face, - so for her own words Since she had the 
favour to be a partaker of the Body and Blood of our Savr in the
H: Commuion she was very strict with hersilf: the sense she had of her
own poverty made her always timerous, least any thing shou'd 
creep in between our Savr and her, and when ever the smallest thing
did; she cou'd never be easy till it was want'd away by the Blood of
our Savr which had once given her pardon: This watchfullness over
hersilf prov'd the means of her keeping in a close conexion with her
unseen friend; she was for some years past at times very sickly, and 
towards the latter end of last year, she got a bad cold and cough;
which never rightly left her tho' severall means was try'd for that
purpose, Janry 18 1778 she mov'd to Fulneck to see if change of air
wou'd not be of servise to her; but she was soon abliged to move
into the Sickroom her sickness terminating in a Consumption;
it was soon clear to her that our Savr was hastening to prepare her 
for himsilf: and tho' at times she wish'd to recover, yet she soon resignd
hersilf to the will of our Savr that he might do with her as he
thought best, and so spent her time in the Sickroom in a tender childlike
hearts conexion with him in her last days here below, she rejoic'd at the
happy prospect she had in view, often praying that the time might soon
come, it was very agreeable to be near her the peace of our Savr so surr
ounded her, it was likewise a pleasure to her to be visited by the Sisters to
whome she often tould how she long'd to go to her everlasting rest
which longing desire was happily fulfild May ye 3d in the morning
