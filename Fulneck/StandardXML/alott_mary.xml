							<l>Mary Alott</l>
							<l>Was born at Barksland in the Parish of</l>
							<l>Elland. On the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Decr 1734 N S.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>When she was about Three years old her</l>
							<l>Father dyed &amp; she liv&apos;d with her Mother &amp;</l>
							<l>her Aunt (Namely Betty Midgley) who</l>
							<l>jointly Nurs&apos;d &amp; Maintain&apos;d <add place="above">her</add> till she was</l>
							<l>about seven, then her Mother being again</l>
							<l>Married her Aunt left them took a Room</l>
							<l>&amp; design&apos;d to live by herself, But <add place="above">Mary</add> not being</l>
							<l>at all willing to be left behind often begg&apos;d </l>
							<l>her Aunt to take her with her, which </l>
							<l>according<add place="above">ly</add> in a few weeks after she Willlingly</l>
							<l>did, &amp; Cared for her as her own.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>When she was about Nine years old she</l>
							<l>by the Drawing of the Holy Ghost was inclin&apos;d</l>
							<l>to hear the Gospel which she of her own free</l>
							<l>accord begun &amp; Continued Constantly to do. </l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Some time after her Aunt had a mind for</l>
							<l>the more Convenince of hearing the Brn</l>
							<l>to live nearer Smith House &amp; she made it</l>
							<l>out with the Brethren that Mary should also</l>
							<l>come &amp; remain with her which she was very </l>
							<l>glad off.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>In July 1748 they Both of them together got</l>
							<l>leave to live with the Single Sisters in Clack-</l>
							<l>Heaton &amp; she remain&apos;d there &amp; in the same</l>
							<l>Oconomy at Tyre-sell-Hall till we came</l>
							<l>in the Choir House (Which I shall take</l>
							<l>Notice of afterwards)</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>In the year 1751 on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of April she</l>
							<l>was receiv&apos;d in the Congregation which Pleas&apos;d </l>

					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>her very much. In 1753 on the 25 of February</l>
							<l>she after many a Hearty wish &amp; Earnest longing</l>
							<l>for it was addmitted to the Lords Supper</l>
							<l>In the same year was Receiv&apos;d from the Great Girls</l>
							<l>to the Single Sisters Choir.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>She has since about 10, or 11, Years Old,</l>
							<l>carried about a Very Sickly &amp; Weakly Tabernacle</l>
							<l>which she bore without Complaint, &amp; being of an </l>
							<l>exceeding shill quiet, but also very solid &amp;</l>
							<l>sensible <del>Dispossition</del> she was seldom</l>
							<l>heard to speak about any thing except when</l>
							<l>spoken to: But however as we now have found she</l>
							<l>took good Notice of ever thing &amp; Ponderd them in </l>
							<l>her Heart.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>In February this present year she had the</l>
							<l>Small-Pox which not only went very hardly</l>
							<l>with her But also left that remaining on her</l>
							<l>which Render&apos;d her Much more Weak &amp; Sickly</l>
							<l>than before a Consumption appearing thro&apos; her</l>
							<l>Whole Constitution: It was manifest to all about her</l>
							<l>she could not hold it out long, tho she herself wod</l>
							<l>commonly say when ask&apos;d about it &quot;that she was</l>
							<l>pretty well Nevertheless what she inwardly felt</l>
							<l>Brought her <add place="above">also</add> upon the thoughts &amp; consideration </l>
							<l>of going to Our Saviour (as she afterward, de</l>
							<l>clar&apos;d with Joy.)</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>In July she was a little Better but the disor</l>
							<l>der Presently return&apos;d more strong than ever:</l>
							<l>Yet she continued to walk about till the 22d of</l>
							<l>November, then she entirely took her to her</l>
							<l>Room &amp; soon after to her Bed.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Now she freely acknowledgeing that she</l>
							<l>had all this summer last, been in a Continual</l>
							<l>meditation &amp; Consultation with her Dear Saviour</l>
							<l><note type="catchword">about</note></l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<pb />
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>about her going to him, having <add place="above">all</add> along been Senscible</l>
							<l>of it for herself that she should not stay here</l>
							<l>but the Reason why she would not confess it</l>
							<l>openly was because she was affraid she should</l>
							<l>not go as soon as she wish&apos;d for.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>She was now exceeding Bad, but quite Brisk</l>
							<l>in <add place="above">her</add> Spirits &amp; chearful in Heart &amp; Soul, &amp; as before</l>
							<l>even Ever since we have known her she has</l>
							<l>been us&apos;d to speak very little, so Now to the Con</l>
							<l>trary, <add place="above">she</add> spoke a great deal especialy to these</l>
							<l>with whom she had had an intimiate acquaintance</l>
							<l>&amp; Perticularly with Our dear Sister Mary</l>
							<l>who very faithfully visited her all the time</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>On the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> instant she had her Birth-Day</l>
							<l>(being 20; years old,) when many Sisters who vis</l>
							<l>ited her Express&apos;d their Hearty wishes for her</l>
							<l>which she receiv&apos;d, &amp; answer&apos;d with much satis</l>
							<l>faction: In the afternoon her Class made</l>
							<l>her a Very Pretty Love-Feast which rejoice</l>
							<l>ed her Exceedingly &amp; in which she spoke of</l>
							<l>her Departure with such Pleasure &amp; Delight</l>
							<l>as she never had done before; she spoke with</l>
							<l>sister Mary &amp; Made out Ev&apos;ry thing that was in </l>
							<l>her Mind about her Burial, as well as all</l>
							<l>the Hearty wishes &amp; desires of her heart for</l>
							<l>her Class &amp; c. In short she said that this had</l>
							<l>been to her the Happiest day she ever had</l>
							<l>had in all her life. This day &amp; forward she </l>
							<l>unbosom&apos;d &amp; declar&apos;d what she had (Perhaps)</l>
							<l>kept Treasur&apos;d up in her Heart to this Opper</l>
							<l>tunity for some years Past, She spoke of her </l>
							<l>various Troubles &amp; Anxieties in Particular Circum</l>

							<l>Circumstances, such as no body had perciev&apos;d on her</l>
							<l>with a Chearful &amp; Thankful Heart, being</l>

					<p><lg>
							<l>About the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> it being Two years since</l>
							<l>we came in <add place="above">our</add> Choir House she told Sister Mary</l>
							<l>Ev&apos;rything how she had been &amp; was in Tyre-</l>
							<l>sell-Hall at that time, What Anxiety &amp;</l>
							<l>Concern she felt about coming in the Choir House</l>
							<l>fearing Least she should not have leave to </l>
							<l>come &amp; how she had in Shillness Pray&apos;d &amp; wept</l>
							<l>before her dear Lamb, that he would give</l>
							<l>her Leave to come &amp; that if she should have </l>
							<l>that favour that he would grant her the feel</l>
							<l>ing &amp; nearness of his Wounds that she might</l>
							<l>be faithful to him therein &amp;c. Nay his almost</l>
							<l>incredible, how quick &amp; active her Memory</l>
							<l>was over this matter she not only gave Sisr</l>
							<l>Mary an account of herself but of all the </l>
							<l>Sisters in Tyre-sell-Hall at that time, she </l>
							<l>(unperceiv&apos;d) had taken Notice of ev&apos;ry One,</l>
							<l>conduct words &amp; behaviour, But to return</l>
							<l>she also Express&apos;d herself in a very Lively</l>
							<l>manner with grace &amp; Understanding <hi rend="underline">how</hi></l>
							<l>Exceedingly she was Rejoiced when she was</l>
							<l>assured she should come here. She at the </l>
							<l>same time viz&apos; the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Instant spoke w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></l>
							<l>with an inly Tender feeling about the Choir</l>
							<l>&amp; Choir Grace what she has felt since</l>
							<l>she was Receiv&apos;d in the Single Sisters Choir</l>
							<l>&amp; what her dear Bridegroom has done from</l>
							<l>time to time on her therein, &amp; Perticularly</l>
							<l>in this Present Year, together with the Esteem</l>
							<l><note type="&amp;" /></l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<pb />
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>&amp; Satisfaction she has had for, &amp; in the Choir House</l>
							<l>this she did from time to time Repeat And</l>
							<l>also she would allways take notice of many</l>
							<l>Sisters whom she saw &amp; Reflected on their</l>
							<l>Situation at Present and time Pass &amp; when</l>
							<l>Sister Mary came to her then she would sell</l>
							<l>her all her Mind about them &amp; Especialy the</l>
							<l>concern she had had, about her Class under</l>
							<l>some heavy Circumstances some Months agoe</l>
							<l>&amp; being ask&apos;d why she did not speak at such</l>
							<l>time what she had in her mind? She answer&apos;d</l>
							<l>&quot;that she always thought herself too mean</l>
							<l>&amp; too insignificant to Speak Her mind about</l>
							<l>any thing, But she had instead of that gone</l>
							<l>somewhere in a Corner &amp; Wept for them be</l>
							<l>fore her dear Saviour &amp; Pray&apos;d him that he</l>
							<l>would Bless Preserve &amp; keep them &amp; Her</l>
							<l>&amp; that they Might all become a Joy to Him</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Once in Sister Mary&apos;s Presence after having</l>
							<l>fully spoken &amp; Open&apos;d all her Mind to her a</l>
							<l>bout Many things, she took Notice that her</l>
							<l>Aunt (who faithfuly tended &amp; Nurs&apos;d</l>
							<l>her all the time of Sickness) was a Cry</l>
							<l>ing: So she demanded the Reason of her why</l>
							<l>she wept, telling her she had no Ocassion</l>
							<l>to weep for her since &quot;says she&quot; I am fully</l>
							<l>Satisfied &amp; Reconciled both with My Lamb &amp;</l>
							<l>&amp; with all my Sisters &amp; have spoke my mind </l>
							<l>about Everything &amp; Now am Ready to go </l>
							<l>whenever he Pleases</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Thus she Continued under a Deep Sense</l>
							<l>&amp; Speaking of herself &amp; her Choir &amp; Often</l>
							<l>Expressing her Desire to go. But yet she</l>

							<l>would Secretly sometimes say to her Aunt that</l>
							<l>she believ&apos;d she should live till Christmas, but</l>
							<l>If our Saviour Pleasd to take her before, she</l>
							<l>would be glad</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Sunday Last about 11 or 12 in the Evening</l>
							<l>she was Siez&apos;d with the monst Violent pain</l>
							<l>So that Sister Mary who at the same time</l>
							<l>watch&apos;d with her Perceiv&apos;d such a Senscible</l>
							<l>Alteration not only by her Excessive Pains</l>
							<l>but also by the Motion &amp; Alteration of all</l>
							<l>her Faculties that she thought she Realy would </l>
							<l>go, &amp; thereupon ask&apos;d her if she was now quite</l>
							<l>Ready. She with Pleasure &amp; Serenity answerd</l>
							<l>&quot;yes! I am Quite Ready now &amp; shall be glad to</l>
							<l>go to my Lamb as soon as he Pleases&quot;</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>However she reviv&apos;d a little &amp; then desired</l>
							<l>2 verses which she named to be sung for her</l>
							<l>viz Appear as her Protector who turns to</l>
							<l>Joy all Tears &amp; When she shall get Per</l>

						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>She was very Bad all Night &amp; Lay like</l>
							<l>one Expireing till towards Night on Monday</l>
							<l>Yet she Bore her Pains with Much more</l>
							<l>Patience <add place="above">than</add> any one could Expect who did but</l>

							<l>Possibly continue a few days, But if she heard</l>

					<pb />
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>of</l>
							<l>Christmass &amp; of the Joy we Expected in the Birth</l>
							<l>day of our Saviour She would readly answer</l>

							<l>her go to him before or in the Holidays She</l>
							<l>should have a far Better Christmass than </l>
							<l>We and that she would be glad of.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Tusday Night she Alter&apos;d again &amp; on Wed</l>
							<l>nesday Morning was much Worse. In the</l>
							<l>Forenoon we thought again she would Certain</l>
							<l>ly Depart, But she continued and lay severly</l>
							<l>Oppresse&apos;d with the Most Excessive Pangs thro&apos;</l>
							<l>Ev&apos;ry Limb &amp; Fibre, Speaking very little, But</l>
							<l>Panting in Stillness for the Happy Moment</l>
							<l>when she should get the Departing Kiss, And </l>

							<l>almost Rack&apos;d in Pieces with the most shock</l>

							<l>Unpossibl a Human Creature could Bear. she </l>

							<l>Sis Mary then would remind her of the Hard</l>
							<l>Toil &amp; Conflict of our Saviour which he bore</l>
							<l>in his Humanity Saying My dear Heart it</l>

							<l>It is to be Oberv&apos;d that this dear Heart</l>
