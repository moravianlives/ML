    <p>I was born at <a href="#mlpla000094.html">Littletown in the Parish of Birstal</a><br /><em>Novr 30<sup>th</sup> 1715</em> my Parents beeing Presbeterians, <br /> I was Baptised, &amp; brought
      up in the Same Religion<br /> when I was about <em> 16 Years of Age</em> my Corruption <br /> got the mastery over me, and let me in to all manner <br /> of amusements as Singing &amp; Dancing
      and the <br />pleasures of this world, which I pursued with my <br />Whole Heart for 3 Years, which was a great Grief<br /> to my Parents, they admonishd me many times <br /> to leave of this
      ways, but all was to no purpose <br /> for I found I could not help my self. In <em>April <br /> 1734</em> I was Married with my wife at <a href="#mlpla000220.html">Birstal <br /> Church</a>. In
        <em>1738</em> I had Some Conversation <br /> with a man who told me how he had been awaken <br /> end, and what Distress he had been in &amp; how <br /> our Saviour had delivered him, he lent
      me <br /> a Book to read, called the Young mans Guide <br /> upon which I begun to read, &amp; to pray &amp; to reform <br /> my Life, but the happy change did not last <br /> long, but I fell
      soon in to my old course again <br /> untill the <em>Year 1739</em> when <a href="#mlper000536.html">M<sup>r</sup> Ingham</a> begun <br /> to preach and Settled Societys I went to hear <br />
      him, but I felt such a Condemnation in my heart, <br /> thinking my day of Grace was past &amp; that there <br /> was no mercy for me, In this situation I remained <br /> for Some time, but at
      last our Saviour gave <br /></p>

    <p> me a Gracious Look and Refreshed my poor heart<br /> In this happy feeling I went on for Some time, I got <br /> more &amp; more acquainted with
      the B<sup>rn</sup> which proved <br /> a great Blessingto my heart, but when I began to <br /> think well of my self I lost that happy feeling and <br /> became dry in my heart, but my dear
      Saviour<br /> Shewed me my deviation and I crept to Him <br /> as a Sinner, <em>March 2<sup>d</sup> 1750</em> I and my wife <br /> had the Grace &amp; favour to be Received in to the
      <br />Congregation at <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, which was a real <br />Blessingfor my poor heart, there I felt that <br /> our dear Saviour watched in the midst of <br /> His
      Congregation, and that I was one of His <br /> Family, Some times I wept on account of <br /> my faults &amp; wants and Some times my <br />heart near melted with mercy &amp; forgiveness. <br />
