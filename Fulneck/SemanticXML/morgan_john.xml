						<date type="birth" when-iso="1743-05-26">May the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1743</date>. He came to the <orgName en="œconomy">Childn<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>
							Oeconomy</orgName> at <placeName>Bullermeer</placeName> when he was about <date when-iso="1747" cert="medium">3 Years old</date>, and came from thence with the whole
							<orgName en="œconomy">Oeconomy</orgName> to <placeName>Smith house</placeName> in <date when-iso="1749">1749</date>. During his childhood he had a promising Genius and
						Capacity for learning, and in his disposition had something pretty and taking, but with regard to his heart there always appeard a tendency to being close, and re serv&apos;d,
						which often made his Brn sigh, least in futurity the same should continue and consequently prove detrimental to his Boys and Youths course in the <orgName>Congn</orgName>

					<p> About the time of the <orgName en="œconomy">Oeconomies</orgName> removing from <placeName>Smith house</placeName> to <placeName ref="#mlpla000048">Lambshill</placeName> in
							<date when-iso="1753">1753</date> there often appeared something of the dear Mo thers Labour upon his Heart, particularly when his curiosity of which he had a great share
						led him upon searching into things which he was afterwards shy in speaking about. In this course he went on, and his Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> were often very mich
						distressed on his Account, and full of fears lest his want of uprightness and openness would make his course heavy to himself and painful to our <roleName type="honorific"

						become a Sinner. However he applied himself with exemplary Diligence to writing <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> Accounts, and showed a
						certain pleasure in doing whatsoever was committed to him with great faithfulness and punctuallity. </p>

						<persName>Renatus</persName> which seemingly had a blessed effect upon him for a long time af ter, but his close disposition of Mind caused him many anxious moments, when he

					<p> one who had to do with him but he laboured under an <name health="disease">impediment in his Eyesight</name> which often pain&apos;d him and made him dis pair sometimes of ever
						learning to work as he should do </p>
					<p> In <date when-iso="1759-11">Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1759</date> he was one of those Youth when our dear Johannes has been very orderly ever since he came into the
							<placeName>choirhouse</placeName>, always showing Obedience to his <orgName>Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> and esteeming that as highly necessary both in himself
						and others. Those 3 or 4 Months past he has been much more concern&apos;d for a lively Heart, and spoke of it with more feeling than formerly, was also more clear and open
						&amp; had a more real connexion with our <roleName type="honorific">Savr</roleName>. In the begining of his <name health="disease">Sickness</name> which was towards the <date
							when-iso="1761-04">latter end of April</date>, he did not think much of going home, nor did he desire it much because his heart was not in so tender to situation towards
						our <roleName type="honorific">Savr</roleName> as it could &amp; should be. Several serious bands were kept with him, whereby he discovered a sensibility not observed in him
						before. The 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Instant he altered, told a Labourer he knew he was much concern&apos;d on his Account, and not without Reason, for said he <name
							health="disease">my heart has not been so lively as it should</name>, but be not distress&apos;d or troubled about me, perhaps you may think it would not be agreable to me
						to go home, but I can ease you on that Account, and assure you my concern comes not from that Corner, whenever he calls me he will take one to himself, I am his &amp; shall
						certainly go to him, this is a clear and made out matter to me, but my concern is that my heart is not more lively and warm &amp; that I have not enjoy&apos;d his precious
						nearness as I could and should have done. This Conversation was sattisfactory. He also spoke with our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						from that time in a more Sinnerlike but confident manner as long as he was able to speak, &amp; also told his Labourers and other <orgName>Brn</orgName> he now knew he should
						go home this time express&apos;d also a desire after it. At last it was <name health="disease">very difficult for him to speak</name> but when visited did all in his power to
						render himself intelligible </p>
					<p> and particularly to express himself about going home. The <date when-iso="1761-05-07">7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></date> in the Morning he expressed again his desire to go
						home so as to be understood, &amp; about 11 at Night his Sickness took such a turn that it was thought he would go directly. </p>
					<p> From this time he took very little notice of any person or thing about him but lay quite still seemingly without pain till the <date when-iso="1761-05-09">9<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi></date> (that ever memorable day) in the evening while the <orgName>Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> was enjoying the <name
							event="communion">holy Communion</name>, about 1/2 an hour before his de parture he came quite to himself, was very sensible of his pain, but not able to speak, &amp; 3/4
						past 9 while the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> prostrated he was deliverd into the hands of his <roleName type="honorific">Redeemer</roleName> in a peculiar tender manner,
						to whom he breathed out his spirit with the bles sing of his Choir, &amp; during the singing of several Verses in his 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year </p>
