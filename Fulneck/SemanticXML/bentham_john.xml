					<p> The Life of the mar&apos;d <roleName type="honorific">Brother</roleName>
						<persName ref="#mlper000548">John Bentham</persName> who was called Home the <date type="death" when-iso="1772-08-09">9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> August 1772.</date>
					</p>
					<p> He has dictated the following concerning himself. </p>
					<p> I was born at <placeName>Black Hay</placeName> in <placeName>Pudsey Township</placeName>
						<date type="birth" when-iso="1713">1713</date> &amp; <name event="baptism">baptised</name> in the <orgName religion="Anglican">Church of England</orgName> My Mother being poor
						&amp; not able to care for me I was put out <add place="above">by the family</add> as a <roleName type="apprentice">Towns apprentice</roleName> to a <orgName
							religion="Presbyterian">Presbiterian</orgName>. I had no Mind to go on Sundays with any Master to his place of Worship, &amp; having no Concern on my Mind about my
						Salvation I went no where. My Master observing this told me I should be lost if I continued in the way I then was, &amp; should go to a place of Torment when I died. This had
						the Effect upon me that I went to <placeName>Church</placeName> &amp; then I thought my Case was safe, but even this proved the Occasion to hurtful Entanglements, &amp; also to
						my <name event="marriage">marrying</name> unhappily which was attended with many painful Consequences. By this Marriage I had 2 Daughters. When <persName ref="#mlper000536"
								>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Ingham</persName> began to preach in these parts I want to hear him, &amp; the Word had some Effect upon me for some Time, but alas, I
						soon got into my old wretched Course again. Being one Sunday at <placeName>Tong Church</placeName> I was asked by the late <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></roleName>
						<persName>Jonathan Heartly</persName> to go with him to hear the <orgName>Brethren</orgName> at <placeName>Bankhouse</placeName>; at first I told him I would not, but he
						however prevailed upon so to do, &amp; I have abundant Reason to thank my dear <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> that He inclined me to go.
						What I there heard of the Love of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<name type="emotion">melted my heart</name> &amp; had the Effect upon me that I returned home in a very different Mind to what I had before, being now determined to seek in
						earnest after the Salvation of my Soul, nor could I afterwards have Rest or Satisfaction till I found Mercy &amp; peace in <persName type="deity">Jesus Christ</persName>. Soon
						after this I was <name event="reception">rec&apos;d</name> into the <orgName>Society</orgName>, &amp; <date when-iso="1758-03-25">March 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							1758</date> I was <name event="reception">red&apos;d</name> into the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, &amp; the <date when-iso="1758"
							>same Year</date> was admitted to the <name event="communion">holy Communion</name> &amp; spent my Time in a <name type="emotion">truly happy Manner</name> in sweet
						Fellowship with my kind <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> &amp; <roleName type="honorific">Redeemer</roleName>. This was a most </p>

					<p> blessed Season to my poor Heart, &amp; happy would it have been for me if I had remained in this Connexion with my <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName> but turning aside from Him &amp; not proving this Grace nightly I gave Opportunity to the Enemy to blind my Eyes again, to lay hold of me as his Captive
						&amp; to lead me according to his Will, &amp; thus was brought into most shameful &amp; scandalous Things to the unspeakable Grief of the whole <orgName en="congregation"
								>Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, &amp; still more to the Grief &amp; Reproach of my merciful <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName>, &amp; which was oftenwards attended <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> with much Loss, Distress &amp; <name type="emotion">Anguish to my own
							Soul</name> as no one but myself can have a true Conception of. I brought myself into Hell Torment indeed for I forfeited my place &amp; privileges in the <orgName
							en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, &amp; lost all Sight &amp; feeling of my <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName> &amp; my Sins lay so heavy upon me that I knew no possible way of living in this Condition, All which Misery was occasioned by the well known
						Circumstances of my <name event="marriage">second Marriage</name>. I &amp; my wife being both guilty &amp; <name type="emotion">also both miserable &amp; unhappy beyond
							Description</name> we knew not what to do but to weep &amp; cry to <persName type="deity">Jesus</persName> that if possible He might look on us in our deplorable Condition
						&amp; shew Mercy unto us. He was also entreated of us &amp; had Mercy upon such abominable Sinners as we were, that we could believe &amp; feel that He had pardoned our many
						&amp; heinous Transgressions. We then prayed the whole <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> to forgive us &amp; <name event="reception"
							>receive</name> us once more into her Fellowship &amp; which in Time was granted unto us to our abiding Consolation. This was a Grace which I shall thank my sweet <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> for throughout my whole Life &amp; also in Eternity. From this Time I have been enabled to live under a bowing
						Sense of my sweet <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> Love, &amp; the Blessings I have enjoyed in the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi
								rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> have been highly prized by me; yea every the least </p>
					<cb />
					<p> Crumb I enjoyed I rec&apos;d out of Mercy as a Favour I was undeserving of. I shall never be able to thank Him duly for what He has done for me poor unfaithful Sinner, but
						shall etarnally sing of his Love &amp; Mercy &amp; Faithfullness. So far out of his Account. Since his Readmission to the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript"
								>n</hi></orgName> he has spent his Time as a Sinner who had received Grace, &amp; acknowledged himself very undeserving of what he enjoyed. Some Time ago his
						Constitution began to break &amp; he declined gradually, but was chearful in his Heart &amp; confident to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName> &amp; thus continued till he obtained permission to enter into the joy of his <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>. </p>
