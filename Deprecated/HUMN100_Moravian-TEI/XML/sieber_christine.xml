                  Aged 55 years
                  III. The Girl Christine Sieber.
                  She was born at gnadenfry??? the 10th of Sept. 1757.
                  After her Valent Departure of this Life, she came
                  with her Mother as a little child into the Widows 
                  House, where every Body loved her. In her tenderest 
                  years she had a Feeling of our Saviour in her
                  Heart, and in the Day Time She was educated with
                  the Children in the Anstalt. Ano 50 the 18th October
                  She received quite in the Children Anstalt, where
                  She in Comunion with other Children kept many a 
                  Liturgie to our Saviour. Ano 58 She was received 
                  into the Children Congregation. Allway it was a
                  great Blessing to her, when She in comunion with the
                  Children was allowed ot prostrate her self to our Saviour.
                  Her poor Body was so weakly that at last all her limbs
                  grow lame. Therefore she must be carryed everywhere.
                  This caus'd her many a Smart &amp; some tinier impatience 
                  that She must loose so many fine Meetings. But
                  when She thought on our Saviour and is Smart,
                  then She was in her Heart ashamed &amp; of all Heart
                  contented. She wept many Tears &amp; very often confessed:
                  I am a poor &amp; miserable Child, &amp; for all that our
                  ​​​​​​​dear
               </p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  dear Saviour loveth me, as is very often on my 
                  Place so near to me, that I am not able to 
                  describe it. I am willing from all my Heart to renounce every Thing in his Way, to make
                  me soon to his Pleasure.
                  the 3th April She was still with her Children very
                  amusing. The 4th She complaint about great Pain
                  on her Breast, &amp; declared directly that she is to 
                  go home, for that reason She took by her Sisters 
                  who attended &amp; thanked them two times for their
                  Care &amp; trouble whith She made &amp; promised to 
                  think on them by our dear Saviour. After that
                  She toock Leave in a very tender maner by her 
                  Mother &amp; desireth she would sing Verses, as 
                  among the rest these: Ich riech mich auf 
                  Ven Sabbat ang. Mein Seelgen wird such
                  bald einmal aus feinen Hüttchen shwingen.
                  Her Children continued with a sweet Litgurgie
                  around her Bed. After that her tender Desire by 
                  our Saviour was to call her soon home. And said 
                  very often: Lovely Lamb, pray come soon! Asoon
                  and in the Evening at 11 a cllok she went happy
                  home in our Heaven .Wound in her 12 Years of Age
