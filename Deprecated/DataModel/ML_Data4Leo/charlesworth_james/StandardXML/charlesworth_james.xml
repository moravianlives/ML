					<l>Personalia of our late d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James Charlsworth</l>
					<l>who enter&apos;d into the Joy of his Lord July 30th 1770.</l>
					<l>Our late dr Br. James Charlesworth has left the following short account</l>
					<l>of some of the most remarkable particular Circumstances of his Life till</l>
					<l>to the year 1753.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>I was born at Little Gummersal in the parish of Birstal in the </l>
					<l>County of York on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1721. And was Educated by my Parents in </l>
					<l>the principles of the Church of England, in a strict &amp; careful manner, &amp; preserv&apos;d</l>
					<l>from the Seductions w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> many <hi rend="underline">people</hi> <add place="above">youths</add> are expos&apos;d to. When at the Age of</l>
					<l>12 to 14 Years I began to keep company &amp; frequent some of the places</l>
					<l>of Diversions in the World; I never <hi rend="superscript">ed</hi> do it with the same ease &amp;</l>
					<l>Satisfaction w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I saw other people did, but always felt Remorse of</l>
					<l>Conscience, &amp; when I was alone often pray&apos;d to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to have Mercy</l>
					<l>upon me &amp; keep &amp; preserve me from all Sin. At ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> the age of 15, I</l>
					<l>left off all Pleasures &amp; became acquainted with a small Company of Mysticks</l>
					<l>to whom I join&apos;d my Self, Read their Books &amp; became very sober &amp;</l>
					<l>Religious, but found my poor heart wanted something w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I had not.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>When I was about 7 years of age (in the Year 1739) I become</l>
					<l>acquainted with the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> at their first coming to Yorkshire, &amp; my dear</l>
					<l>Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> made me sensible of my lost state &amp; condition, &amp; the Misery &amp; Corruption</l>
					<l>of my Nature, &amp; that it was his Blood alone w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> in make me happy,</l>
					<l>&amp; as such a poor Sinner. I fled for Refuge to his wounds &amp; found peace</l>
					<l>thro&apos; the Virtue &amp; power of his merits &amp; Death. In the year 1740 I went</l>
					<l>to Lond<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. I staid some time w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> there, &amp; return&apos;d again to </l>
					<l>Yorkshire the same year. I was Reced into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Decr: 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 1742</l>
					<l>soon after the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> was establishd here, &amp; was admitted to be a</l>
					<l>Partaker of the Body &amp; Blood of my Crucified Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> July</l>
					<l>6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1743. I was Confirmd as a witness of the sufferings &amp; Atonem<hi rend="superscript">t</hi></l>
					<l>of the Lamb of God by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spangenberg the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Dec the same year</l>
					<l>before w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> had left my Busyness &amp; Relations &amp; went to Live at the </l>

					<l>first S. B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Oeconomy at Holbeck where I continued till the 20</l>
					<l>July 1744, when I was bless&apos;d by imposition of hands to the Office of </l>
					<l>Vorsteher of the S. B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, after wch I was mostly employd in Preaching &amp;</l>
					<l>visiting the young Men in the different Societies, which I continued till 1748</l>
					<l>about w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> time I was obliged to engage so deeply in the Manufactory and</l>
					<l>other outward affairs that I declin&apos;d preaching, &amp; for sev<hi rend="superscript">l </hi>years together</l>
					<l>went thro&apos; a Scene of Distress in my own Mind with the External affairs</l>
					<l>in w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I was engagd, however I continued <hi rend="strikethrough">therein</hi> to assist therein, &amp; went</l>
					<l>several times to Holland on that Acc<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> &amp; bore a part in most of the Transac-</l>
					<l>tions till the year 1753, when Ruin seem&apos;d to threaten our whole Constitution,</l>
					<l>if our <hi rend="superscript">dr</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had not miraculously interpos&apos;d &amp;
						Inspird the d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Disciple</l>
					<l>w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Courage &amp; Generosity more than Human, whereby he was enabled to</l>
					<l>satisfy all the Creditors, being willing to take all the Debt upon himself</l>
					<l>w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> had been Contracted without his knowledge &amp; Consent. &apos;Tis true I endea-</l>
					<l>vour&apos;d to hinder his engaging himself for such vast Sums of Money</l>
					<l>w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> He had no visible fund to discharge withal, &amp; wo&apos;d rather have</l>
					<l>suffer&apos;d any hardships myself, than be the occasion of Involving his</l>
					<l>dr. Person, but he was Resolv&apos;d to do it &amp; did it I dout not af the</l>
					<l>Command of his Lord &amp; Master, who <hi rend="strikethrough">has</hi> indeed has miraculously</l>
					<l>help&apos;d him thro&apos; to the wonder &amp; astonishmt of all men both Friend</l>
					<l>&amp; Enemies, &amp; wch certainly among the Surprising Transactions of</l>
					<l>his Life in the Kingdon of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <add place="above">will</add> see transmilted down to the </l>
					<l>latest posterity as an unparrelld act of <hi rend="strikethrough">his</hi> love &amp; faithfulness &amp;</l>
					<l>Generosity to his people. with the conclusion of these dangerous</l>
					<l>&amp; troublesome Affairs of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, I reckon I may also conclude</l>
					<l>one period of my Life w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> probably contains pretty near the whole</l>
					<l>of the mortal past &amp; when I look back how I have spent it and</l>
					<l>consider that I have been almost twice seven Years in the Kingdom</l>
					<l>of our <add place="above">dr</add> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, I really Blush &amp; my heart is asham&apos;d before my</l>
					<l>faithful Creator &amp; Redeemer, that I have been so little Joy to Him</l>

					<l>on his Birth Day Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1753. He wrote <add place="above">the</add> following</l>
					<l>My ever dearest Lamb, my only Saviour &amp; Redeemer, my Heart adores</l>

					<l>O my Lamb let it be the year in w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> my whole Being shall be made</l>
					<l>like unto thee, &amp; wherein everything unlamblike shall be Interr&apos;d</l>
					<l>for ever, The year wherein I may Receive an everlarding Impression of</l>

					<l>The office w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he had in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> at Fulneck requiring
						that he</l>
					<l>sho have a Helpmate, He enter&apos;d Nov<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1754 into
						the M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> State with the</l>
					<l>S S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eleanora Gutbier his present Widow, to whom he had approv&apos;d himself</l>
					<l>a faithful tender Husband, &amp; they have liv&apos;d near 16 years together in</l>
					<l>Grace &amp; Blessing.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l> In the year 1755 when the place Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> was Settled, He was</l>
					<l>appointed to be the Vorsteher (or Warden) of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at the same time <add place="above">that</add> he</l>
					<l>had the direction of the Manufacture, &amp; in this Office He continued till</l>
					<l>it pleased our Lord to call him to his Eternal Rest.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>From the very beginning of the Settlement here, He was particularly</l>
					<l>engag&apos;d in every undertaking &amp; till the year 1763, all the external</l>
					<l>Affairs of this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> relating to the Settlement viz the Administration</l>
					<l>of the Estate &amp; Buildings, were in his Hands. In this Situation</l>
					<l>he had many difficulties to struggle with, &amp; felt often the Lord that</l>
					<l>was upon him with much concern. From the year 1755, he was</l>
					<l>not only employed in the External affairs, but He &amp; His dear wife</l>
					<l>assisted in the Internal Labour. <add place="above">In 1754 He was ordain&apos;d a</add></l>
					<l><add place="above">Deacon of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn&apos;s</hi> Church</add></l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>In June 1756, he with his wife went to the Synod at Berthelsdorf</l>
					<l>Tho&apos; he was chiefly to the Service of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi> in Yorkshire, yet he was</l>
					<l>also engag&apos;d in the Affairs of Ockbrook, Duckenfield, &amp; in sundry concerns</l>
					<l>of the Unity &amp; our Lord having bestow&apos;d upon him particular Gifts &amp; Grace</l>
					<l>to his Service, he remain&apos;d active in all those matters.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>In the Year 1757 he was appointed to be one of the Board of</l>
					<l>Administation of the Affairs of the Unity in England, &amp; was usefull</l>
					<l>therein, &amp; when the Oconomates Con<hi rend="superscript">fr</hi> was Settled, he was appointed</l>

					<l>a member thereof &amp; continued as such till that Con<hi rend="superscript">fer</hi> ceas&apos;d in the </l>
					<l>year 1769. Tho&apos; his Talents in the Conducting the external <add place="above">affairs</add> were</l>
					<l>known &amp; priz&apos;d by his B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; on that account He was constantly</l>
					<l>employ&apos;d in that way, yet he also wish&apos;d to be rather employ&apos;d in </l>
					<l>the Internal Labour, &amp; often express&apos;d his desire to be freed from all</l>
					<l>his External engagements. In consequence of this his repeated</l>
					<l>Request, He was Released in 1763 from being immediately active</l>
					<l>in the Manufacture, tho&apos; he remain&apos;d the Counsellor in it till the</l>
					<l>year 1766; when it came into another Channel.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>Being Proprietor of the Estate, He frequently attended the Meetings</l>
					<l>of the Parish for conducting the Town&apos;s Busyness, &amp; by his prudent</l>
					<l>advice He gain&apos;d the esteem of the acting persons in the Parish &amp;</l>
					<l>was of Service in this point of view to the Settlement.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>He went as Deputy of this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> to the Gen Synods at Marienborn</l>
					<l>in 1764 &amp; last Year, &amp; returned from the last very infirm, tho&apos; his disorder</l>
					<l>w&apos;d not permit him to go much about, yet he assisted in the Labour</l>
					<l>in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; from this time, the publick Testimony of our Savr &amp; his</l>
					<l>Suffrings &amp; the Discourses w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he Deliver&apos;d to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; Choirs were</l>
					<l>particularly Anointed, &amp; being delivered with warmth of heart were</l>
					<l>attended with Blessing. So that some B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> made for thence the </l>
					<l>Remark that they believed he wo<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not stay long in the Church below</l>
					<l>for he was preparing for the Church above. It was also observ&apos;d</l>
					<l>in his Discourses &amp; Conversation, the apprehensions He had of the </l>
					<l>dangerouse principle of Free thinking &amp; acting w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> had erept in</l>
					<l>amongst us, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> might be more hurtful to our Constitution, than</l>
					<l>any other difficulty we were sensible of</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>He had for many years past frequent Sicknesses, &amp; having a</l>
					<l>great portion of sensibility, when matters did not go well &amp; contrary</l>
					<l>to his hopes, his Body felt the effects thereof. He was of a</l>

					<l>inward Grief prey&apos;d upon him, of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he was sensible &amp; wo<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>speak</l>
					<l>of at times with concern. All this seem&apos;d to impair his Body &amp;</l>
					<l><hi rend="strikethrough">of the after land carnal which </hi> He often said &amp; wrote that his chief</l>

					<l>to enter into the presence of his Lord.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>Last spring He had a very severe attack of the stone Cholick</l>
					<l>of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> He Recovr&apos;d so as to be active in his Office, yet the Effects</l>
					<l>were Visible. He had a second fitt of sickness with an Inflamation</l>
					<l>in his Face &amp; a violent pain in his Head by w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he was confin&apos;d</l>
					<l>to his Room ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> a fortnight, but was again so well Recover&apos;d</l>
					<l>as to go about, but his Constitution was apparently weaken&apos;d w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi></l>
					<l>rais&apos;d the apprehensions of his going home of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he spoke frequent-</l>
					<l>ly with desire. He preached on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to a very large Auditory</l>
					<l>with Life &amp; Energy, of the efficacious power in Jesus&apos; Blood &amp;</l>
					<l>Death to make us New Creatures, and his last meeting kept in</l>
					<l>the Hall was a Discourse to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> for the
						Conclusion</l>
					<l>of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Day on the W. W<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>&quot;Shew forth his

					<l>we were still in hopes that by the discharge of the Abcess in</l>

					<l>we observ&apos;d an Alteration &amp; that the weight of his disorder was</l>
					<l>fallen upon his Lungs, then it became evident that our gracious</l>

					<l>when the Clock struck two, he seem&apos;d something disappointed that he</l>
