					<lb/>Mary Elizabeth Thornton
					<lb/>was born on the 16<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>th</hi> of December
					<lb/>1831 in the little village of Tong
					<lb/>At the age of about four years the
					<lb/>learned to read with great facility,
					<lb/>and indeed began early to give indi
					<lb/>cations of an ardent thirst for knowledge
					<lb/>and intense delight in reading.
					<lb/>Half a year afterwards her parents
					<lb/>removed to Fulnec, but previously
					<lb/>to that she had lodged there with
					<lb/>some several kind friends, that she might
					<lb/>have the benefit of the day schools.
					<lb/>For seven years she remained there,
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_51Thornton-02.jpg" n='2'/>
			<p>
				
					<lb/>though not attending school regularly, as
					<lb/>her mother required her assistance in
					<lb/>the household duties.
					<lb/>The pleasure she seemed to feel in her
					<lb/>studies while at school, and the
					<lb/>progress she made during that
					<lb/>short period, together with her affec
					<lb/>tion for teachers &amp; companions, were
					<lb/>gratifying proofs to her dear parents
					<lb/>that she was under the fixed influ
					<lb/>ence of correct principles, in endea
					<lb/>vouring to redeem the time she
					<lb/>felt of so great value.
					<lb/>In her 16<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> year she went to
					<lb/>Bootle where she remained for 7
					<lb/>months, but owing to her health
					<lb/>&amp; the removal of the family to
				
			<cb/>
				
					<lb/>London she was obliged to return
					<lb/>home. While there the enjoyed
					<lb/>the Society of a Christian minister
					<lb/>of the established Church, of whom
					<lb/>she often spoke &amp; from those conver
					<lb/>aations ahe derived great benefit.
					<lb/>Her health improving, she went to
					<lb/>Lancashire, but as in the course
					<lb/>of a few months, a change seemed
					<lb/>desirable both by her parents &amp;
					<lb/>B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Miller, the latter took her
					<lb/>into his own house, where she
					<lb/>remained about a year &amp; nine
					<lb/>months.
					<lb/>During her stay in Salem, she
					<lb/>experienced much blessing, by
					<lb/>occasion of her reception into the
					<lb/>Church (of Christ) by the rite
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_51Thornton-03.jpg" n='3'/>
			<p>
				
					<lb/>of confirmation.
					<lb/>Though we were not with her at the
					<lb/>time, the remembrance she left be
					<lb/>hind her with a few friends, leads us
					<lb/>to believe that there existed a feeling
					<lb/>of Christian fellowship between her
					<lb/>and the little flock in Salem, with
					<lb/>which she was connected, which affords a
					<lb/>pleasing recollection to her sorrowing
					<lb/>relations.
					<lb/>Owing to circumstances her return
					<lb/>home was thought desirable by her
					<lb/>parents, she having a large
					<lb/>family also required her assistance
					<lb/>Beautiful instances might be
					<lb/>given of her now chastened delight
					<lb/>in the society of her parents &amp;
					<lb/>friends, and her deep solitude
				
			<cb/>
				
					<lb/>for the wellfare of her brothers &amp;
					<lb/>sisters. The Sabbath services
					<lb/>were enjoyed with a keener relish,
					<lb/>never had home been so sweet, or did the
					<lb/>wishes of her parents meet with
					<lb/>such a warm response, as at this time,
					<lb/>for it was her delight, to do everything
					<lb/>in her power to assist them in their
					<lb/>various duties, as long as her
					<lb/>health would permit.
					<lb/>In December 1853 she took
					<lb/>violent cold &amp;  cough, which never
					<lb/>left her, but gradually brought
					<lb/>to the lingering diseaze which
					<lb/>terminated her life
					<lb/>Owing to the particular nature of her
					<lb/>complaint, she always entertained the
					<lb/>hope that she was better which her
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_51Thornton-04.jpg" n='4'/>
			<p>
				
					<lb/>friends were always glad to admit,
					<lb/>as they wished it to be so, as much
					<lb/>as she herself did. But finding
					<lb/>it was the Lords will that she should
					<lb/>not be restored, it was pleasing to
					<lb/>see her calm resignation to Him,
					<lb/>who she said &quot;did all things well.&quot;
					<lb/>She was many times asked during her
					<lb/>illness, if she could resign herself to
					<lb/>the Lords will, whether He should
					<lb/>take her or restore her, but she
					<lb/>always replied that she tried to do
					<lb/>so, &amp; being naturally of a reserved
					<lb/>disposition, her friends took it for
					<lb/>granted that she did so, and her
					<lb/>calm &amp; happy death afforded a
					<lb/>sufficient proof. A few evenings
				
			<cb/>
				
					<lb/>before her departure, her little
					<lb/>brother having gone in to bid her
					<lb/>good night, she asked him if he
					<lb/>prayed to our Savior to take her to
					<lb/>himself, when he innocently replied
					<lb/>&quot;yes,&quot; and she appeared quite pleased
					<lb/>that he did so.
					<lb/>The day before she died her father
					<lb/>read the texts, and the passage for
					<lb/>the day, from Bogatzky&apos;s Golden
					<lb/>Treasury, and the verses attached to
					<lb/>them were &quot;Let me but hear my
					<lb/>Savior say, - Strength shall be
					<lb/>equal to thy day, - Then I re
					<lb/>joice in deep distress, - Leaning
					<lb/>on all sufficient grace -
					<lb/>I glory infirmity, - That
					<lb/>Christ&apos;s own power may rest on me,
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_51Thornton-05.jpg" n='5'/>
			<p>
				
					<lb/>When I am week, then I am strong.
					<lb/>Grace is my shield &amp; Christ my song.
					<lb/>On hearing these, she exclaimed,
					<lb/>Oh! <hi rend='underlined:true;'>that</hi> is enough for me!
					<lb/>On the day she died her brothers &amp;
					<lb/>sisters were called into her room
					<lb/>at her request, that she might
					<lb/>take leave of them which she did
					<lb/>in a manner that will not easily
					<lb/>be chased from their memory.
					<lb/>A short time before she expired, she
					<lb/>requested her friends to sing for her
					<lb/>the hymn, &quot;For ever with the Lord&quot;
					<lb/>Being very anxious to have it sung,
					<lb/>she began herself &amp; joined in the
					<lb/>singing of the whole hymn as well
					<lb/>as she was able. When it was con
					<lb/>cluded, she wished the evening
				
			<cb/>
				
					<lb/>hymn to be sung during which she
					<lb/>sank into unconscious stumber, and
					<lb/>we believe sweetly fell asleep in
					<lb/>Jesus.
					<lb/>From this brief narrative drawn up
					<lb/>by her relations it is evident that our
					<lb/>late Sister was acquainted with our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>
					<lb/>&amp; that the instructions she received in
					<lb/>Childhood were blessed to her soul.
					<lb/>The time of her residence in Salem espec
					<lb/>ially in the family of B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Miller was
					<lb/>in important period of her life for then
					<lb/>the Lord opened her heart that she
					<lb/>attended to the things that make for our
					<lb/>peace. On her return home about
					<lb/>4 years ago, and for some time after,
					<lb/>she showed an humble teachable spirit
					<lb/>and an eager desire for spiritual conversation.
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_51Thornton-06.jpg" n='6'/>
			<p>
				
					<lb/>Latterly tho&apos; her conduct was always
					<lb/>correct, she did not evince the same
					<lb/>openheartedness, and that desire after
					<lb/>spiritual food, which caused an anxious
					<lb/>fear on her account, that a spiritual
					<lb/>decline had taken place, and that the
					<lb/>world was drawing her aside from the
					<lb/>simplicity of Christ.
					<lb/>Of this she herself spoke in the latter
					<lb/>days of her life, and sorrowed over the
					<lb/>sad effects of remisness in watchfulness
					<lb/>&amp; prayer.
					<lb/>This together with her naturally very
					<lb/>reserved disposition, made it difficult
					<lb/>at first to draw her out into conver
					<lb/>sation on the state of her heart.
					<lb/>She clung to life and from the flattering
					<lb/>nature of her complaint, she cherished
					<lb/>the hope of recovery till within a few
					<lb/>weeks of her dissolution, ever after it
					<lb/>was apparent to her friends from her
					<lb/>increasing weakness that she would not
				
			<cb/>
				
					<lb/>recover.
					<lb/>Latterly she shared a greater desire
					<lb/>after spiritual conversation &amp; and reading
					<lb/>and desired that prayer should be offered
					<lb/>up in her room. Once she said, &quot;I often
					<lb/>reflect on what you day, tho&apos; I cannot
					<lb/>express my feelings, &amp; when I lift my
					<lb/>heart up to our Savior, he meets me.&quot;
					<lb/>On Saturday 7<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> she expressed
					<lb/>a strong desire once more to enjoy the
					<lb/>holy Communion and said &quot;now I
					<lb/>have given up the hope of being able to
					<lb/>go to Chapel &amp; I should feel it a favour
					<lb/>to have it administered in my room.&quot;
					<lb/>On that occasion she spoke freely
					<lb/>of the state of her heart, and expressed
					<lb/>a wish that any the most searching
					<lb/>question should be put to her, as she felt
					<lb/>the great importance of being prepared
					<lb/>What she said, confirmed the hope

					<lb/>we had entertained, that Jesus was not an
					<lb/>unknown Saviour to her - and, that the
					<lb/>way of peace &amp; happiness thro&apos; faith in his
					<lb/>blood, was one in which she had walked.
					<lb/>Yet a mist seemed to hang over her path 
					<lb/>and she had not a cheerful bright prospect.
					<lb/>Knowing that she had forsaken the Lord &amp;
					<lb/>grieved his holy Spirit, she felt confused &amp;
					<lb/>afraid. The confidence of faith
					<lb/>had left her, &amp; like many others she was
					<lb/>looking for the evidences of her justifications
					<lb/>in her own feelings, and expecting to see
					<lb/>these before she could lay hold of the hope
					<lb/>of the Gospel. Looking for the fruits be
					<lb/>fore the branch was grafted into the vine
					<lb/>or the tree planted.
					<lb/>Being directed to turn to our Saviour
					<lb/>just as she felt and assured of his mercy &amp;
					<lb/>readiness to forgive &amp; to heal our backslidings
					<lb/>her mind was much comforted. The texts
					<lb/>of Scripture that were repeated were blessed
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_51Thornton-08.jpg" n='8'/>
			<p>
				
					<lb/>by the holy spirit to her soul. These
					<lb/>were the words of Jesus, I am the resurrection
					<lb/>&amp; the life he that believeth in me, etc
					<lb/>and I am he that liveth &amp; was dead and
					<lb/>behold I am etc and I have set
					<lb/>before thee an open door etc.
					<lb/>These texts and this conversation she referred
					<lb/>to several times in the following week and
					<lb/>wished the texts to be read.
					<lb/>On Sunday 8<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> the H. Com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> was
					<lb/>administered to her &amp; the family in presence
					<lb/>of a  few friends. It proved a great re
					<lb/>freshment to her and tho&apos; the service
					<lb/>had as we feared, exhausted her, yet she was
					<lb/>able to take the air in the evening her
					<lb/>dear father driving her out in a gig.
					<lb/>But this proved the last time of her leaving
					<lb/>the sick chamber. The following
					<lb/>night she became much worse, difficulty
					<lb/>of breathing came on, &amp; she had a restless
					<lb/>night. But the following day she was
					<lb/>cheerful &amp; composed and spoke with joy
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_51Thornton-09.jpg" n='9'/>
			<p>
				
					<lb/>of the prospect of going home  saying
					<lb/>&quot;I have no fear. I can give all up Jesus
					<lb/>will receive me.&quot;
					<lb/>On Tuesday however her mind was
					<lb/>not so composed, and what she said led us
					<lb/>to see, that the H. Ghost was deepening
					<lb/>his own work on her heart, probing the
					<lb/>wounds and showing her more of her
					<lb/>own vileness, that he might thus prepare
					<lb/>her for richer displays of the Grace of Jesus.
					<lb/>On Friday morning the writer of
					<lb/>this witnessed a scene of the most solemn
					<lb/>&amp; affecting nature. The dear patient felt
					<lb/>that the time of her departure was
					<lb/>drawing nigh and desired to see &amp;
					<lb/>take leave of all the family.
					<lb/>With composure of mind she gave each of
					<lb/>her brothers &amp; sisters words of admonition,
					<lb/>that retrust will not be lost or forgotten.
					<lb/>Earnestly did she exhort them to love our
					<lb/>Saviour to walk in his ways, that they
				
			<cb/>
				
					<lb/>might all meet again in heaven.
					<lb/>After this with upfolded hands, she com
					<lb/>mended them in prayer to our Saviour and
					<lb/>was heard in broken accents saying &quot;dear
					<lb/>Savior bless them&quot; bless all and bless all
					<lb/>my kind friends who have been so kind to
					<lb/>me bless them O Jesus!&quot;
					<lb/>It was good to be there for the
					<lb/>presence of Jesus was powerfully felt
					<lb/>of this the dear patient testified saying
					<lb/>&quot;I feel his nearness. I am his he is mine
					<lb/>he will not leave me.&quot;
					<lb/>At her request we then sung a few verses
					<lb/>in which she joined, expressive of the
					<lb/>happiness of the redeemed around the
					<lb/>throne. And having in prayer commended
					<lb/>her departing spirit of Jesus the blessing
					<lb/>the Lord has imparted to her she joined
					<lb/>in the singing of the words &quot;In the name
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_51Thornton-10.jpg" n='10'/>
			<p>
				
					<lb/>of Jesus. Amen!
					<lb/>In the afterpart of the day she revived a
					<lb/>little till about 11 O&apos;Clock at night
					<lb/>when a change was perceptible.
					<lb/>She requested that some verse might
					<lb/>be sung &amp; selected them herself and
					<lb/>was so collected &amp; interested in the service,
					<lb/>that once the began the tune, and corrected
					<lb/>her dear father who had read a word
					<lb/>wrong. The concluding verses of the
					<lb/>hymn sung were we believe expressive
					<lb/>of the state of her mind, and of the bliss
					<lb/><hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>ha</hi> she now enjoys.
					<lb/>125 Ps - v  7- 10
					<lb/>&quot;For ever with the Lord!&quot; etc.
