to Tyrsal-hall, were She became more Acquainte 
with our Saviour, She was a Chearfull and happy
heart, her Disposishon was Childlike an  honest
which made her belvoed by all the Sisters, who had
to do with her, in the Year 51, She got a great desier
to be recived in to the Congregation, which was granted

Grace She enjoyed for the first time August ye 13th in the
Same Year, it was avery weaight and preciour Grace
to her, that She was now apertake of the Corpess and
blood of her Dearest Lord and Saviour She was then
quit  quite Chearfull, and one Could percive that her whole aim
and intension was; to be a plesuer to his heart, Who
had Shed his blood for her; when the Sisters removed
out of the EOconemys, into the Choir-house, She had
the faviour to be one of them, and thought her Self
highly faviourd, that She had aplase among that Choir
Which our Saviour him Self has brought to gether, to be
an Honer to his Name, and a reward for all his Smart
and pain

Complaind very Little, She often Longd to be
at home with our Saviour, for She Said that her
Disorder was of Such a natuer, that She was
Likely to be very troblesom to the Sisters, which
was some pain to her, but her Cheerfulness of
heart made it aplesuer to see her;
When the dear Desipl and mother was here
in the Year 54 and keept the first Choir Sacrament
She had the faviour to be one of that Number
it was a great adishon to her joy, that her
Bridegroom and Lover had ownd an such a
manner, tho She according to her thoughts was
one of the meenest and has meny times since Said
that in all her Life She Could not forget, and
when She Shou'd once get the faviour to see
her frind and Lover She would kiss his bleed-
ing feet for it.
in March Last She began to Cough, and her
Sores did not Appear much but it Strulk more
in her, and Settled on her Longes, She made Use
Of Medisens, but it was to no Affect, it was so
in her mind that our Saviour would soon fetch
her to him Self, this became daly more plain
to her and She only wishd that her time might
be Short, for She Longd much to be at home
July the 17 ye 13th She took to the Sick-room
out of which She Came nomoe her disorder was
not all aside with much pain; but She has been
Carrid an in a very easy manner, drind her whole
Sickness She has remaind in a Close Conextion
with the man of Smart, so that one Could feel it
when ever one Spok with her; her heart burnt with
tender Longing after her Eternal Bridegroom


She meny time Expressd in word how near She
felt him, and how tender-Ly he imbraced Her
Perticulerly the Last Sacrament, of which She
got her Share in the Sick-room, the time before
when She enjoyd it with hannah Clark, She was some-
what grived that She went before her, but how ever
Satisfied her Self Saying, I Shall Stay one Lordsupper
more, and then I Shall go to the Saviour; being
Asked if She Shoud Like to Stay till the near enjoyment
She Said yeas if he will have me Stay, I am resind, but
not for that, I will not Stay, becose when I am with him I
Shall alwas  always keep the Lord-supper
She then begd our Saviour Soon to fetch her, and
not to Let her Stay to Long the Sisters told She Choud

woud Say do you think so, then I will be Satisfid
Her Class Srs made her a Love-feast, on acount of
