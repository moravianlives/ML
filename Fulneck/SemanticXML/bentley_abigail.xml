                  remember my first thought of being fared was thro' hereing my  speak with another what time Children begun to be anserable for Sin and they thought at
                  Seven-years, this had such an impression on my mind that I often went alone and wish'd <persName type="deity">God</persName> wou'd let me die before that time for then I took it for
                  granted I should be saved, <date when-iso="1729" cert="medium">when I was about Seven Years</date> I began to be <name>afraid</name> of dying, my Parrents strove to
                  preserve me as far as there circumstances permitted them, <date when-iso="1733">in my Eleventh year</date> I was sent to live with a Neighbour where I heard and saw all sorts of bad
                  things had not our dear <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> had a perticular Hand over me I should have been ruined in Soul and Body, when I was there they sent me into a
                  Feild to work where I was so cold that I had no feeling of Hands nor Fat nor could I come to any House, all on a sudden it came in my mind that <hi rend="superscript"><persName type="deity">God</persName></hi> could warm me and I grew directly warm this was the first time I <del>know</del> thot <persName type="deity">God</persName> could here us
                     <del>or know </del> or know any thing of us after some time I left this place and removed into a nother <del>place</del> that was more agreable, here I took much to reading and
                  intended to be very good, but amidst it all I ataind to no satisfaction but a constant condemnation follow'd me with every thing I did, so far her own <del>words</del>
