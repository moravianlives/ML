Br. Peter Hyland, died May 1846
Our late brother was born in this at Fulnic
place Septr 12th 1774, & baptised in
this chapel a few days after his birth.
He was brot up here & recd all his education
at the Boys' Day School, which was, however
superior in point both of instruction
& discipline, to most other day schools
& he was apprenticed to his father, a baker by trade
at the proper age, afterwards entered into
partnership with him & took the whole
concern into his own hands at his fa
ther's decease in the yr. 1818. Thus he
was born, educated, spent his whole life
died & is buried in one & the same place, & he has
been heard to say that he never spent
more than a week together out of Fulnec.
He was twice married, first in 1802 or 3
to Ann Birkby by whom he had 4 children
all sons; the oldest, Joseph, died several years ago.
leaving 3 sons, & the youngest, Peter, died departed soon
after his birth, the other John & Thomas
survive & by them he has seen 12 grand
Children 7 Boys & 5 Girls in all.
His first wife departed happily in
Octr 1811, & in the yr. following he
was united to his second partner, Mary
Wheatley, but had no children by that
marriage. She likewise preceded her
husband to a better world in Augt. 1838.
Our later brother's family, at the time
of his birth, occupied the house adjoin


ing that in which my parents resided
& dwelt there for many years afterwards
hence, tho' he was many years my senior
I have known him intimately from my
earliest childhood, & am the better able,
therefore, to give a sketch of his character.
He was naturally of a very agreeable
temper, had a shred of good-natured droller
ry & humour about him (which however was never
indulged to excess or led him into that
jesting "foolish talking & jesting, which
are not convenient"). was kind-hearted,
& almost uniformally cheerful; he
was a most industrious man & ???
strict integrity & uprightness of cha
racter, both as a tradesman & as a pri
vate character, & hence no doubt, the
blessing of God that rested on his "faith
fulness in business;" never, too, the
respect & esteem in which he was held
by all connected with him, whether in
the way of trade & business, or as neigh
bours, acquaintances, or friends; & hence
the affection felt for him by his
relatives & Christian friends. He was
a kind & loving husband, father & grand
father, & tho' he had attained to a 
good old age, nearly 72 years, he is
sincerely regretted by many & will long
be held in affectionate remembrance.
He became a member of the Brns church
& was admitted by confirmation to the
Lords table in his youth, probably abt
the age of 16, tho' we cannot mark the


precise date. Being He was from his infancy
brot. up in the knowledge of the truth in the
nature & ??? of the Lord, & in the bosom
of a Christian Congn & connected with a peo
ple of God, going in & out among them, &
enjoying all the means of grace with them:
nor were these inestimable privileges thrown
away upon him; no doubt, his spiritual course
was chequered & he had seasons of compa
rative coldness & indifference of heart
& of consequent unfruitfulness; but
he had a correct & clear views of evangeli
cal truth & especially of the all-important
point, that Jesus Christ is made ??? us of
God wisdom & righteousness, sanctificat;
& redemption & that naught else avails
to save lost sinners; & tho' he was not
one of those who are called to go down to the
battle, but rather to carry it by the staff & to occupy
an humble & comparatively obscure
sphere all the days of his life; altho, so far
being forward to converse on spiritual
subjects, he was rather the very reverse,
&, until the last 2 or 3 days of his life,
more close & reserved their night have
been desirable, yet, his consistent
conduct, his Christian spirit, his evident
love of the Lord's house & value of the
means of grace, the faithfulness &
pleasure with which he, for many years,
attended to to duties of various offices
entrusted to him in this Congn; as well
as the more open communications on
spiritual matters, which marked his last
days, & the peace in which he at last
fell asleep, assure us that he knew whom
he had believed & was in Christ Jesus, as his


refuge & fortress, his robe & his
life-supplying stream.
He was, for a long series of years, probably
30 or many a member of the committee of
this Congn, &, for a still more lengthened 
period of its council; & in the performance
of his duties in these capacities, his con
secreations, principles, & his faithfulness
integrity, plain sound sense, & practical wisdom were both
conspicuous & useful. He was also, for
the unusual period of 52 years & until
quite lately, a chapel-servant, & in the
discharge of this gratuitous services con
nected with that office formerly for
more onerous than they are now, he showed
not only exemplary faithfulness & dili
gence, but an untiring interest, & even
delight.
Our late Br was blessed with a good con
stitution & generally robust health; he seems,
however, to have been rather subject to rheumatic
affections, & in the yr 1818 suffered severely
from rheumatic fever. He was however, hole &
active until he had completed his 71st year.
but in the course of last winter his strength
began visibly to decline, & the more rapidly
as the spring advanced; he was, however, to the
last, quite free from pain, his whole ail
ment being a breaking off of nature & con
sequent decline of strength; increasing
drowsiness was the most marked symptom
of his complaint, if complaint it may be
called, & he mentioned it as a great
mercy, that he enjoyed sound & undisturbed sleep
the night thro', to the very last. It was a
source of regret to him that, owing to his
increasing weakness, he was but rarely able
to come to the house of God in the evening
meetings last winter; but because as often
as it was at all in his power & to was even
present.
