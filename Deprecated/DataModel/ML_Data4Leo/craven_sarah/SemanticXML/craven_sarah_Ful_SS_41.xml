					<l>The Life of the Single Sister Sar<hi rend="superscript:true;">h</hi> Craven</l>
					<l>who departed 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <hi rend="strikethrough">Nov</hi> 1790</l></lg></p>
<p><lg>
					<l> I was born at Bothwell near Leeds in</l>
					<l>the ???? Nov 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1717. I lived with my</l>
					<l>Parents till my Father died who belonged</l>
					<l>to the Church of England. When I was a</l>
					<l>Child  I often wished to die, for I thought at</l>
					<l>that age I should be saved; but if I lived to</l>
					<l>grow up to be a Woman I should come into</l>
					<l>things which would hinder me from at-</l>
					<l>taining eternal happiness. When I came into</l>
					<l>riper years, I followed the World with ea-</l>
					<l>gerness, tho' not with satttisfaction; for I often</l>
					<l>felt ureasy in my mind but put if off,</l>
					<l>resolving to grow better, but still went on</l>
					<l>in my old way. After my Father's death</l>
					<l>I went to live with my Uncle &amp; was with</l>
					<l>him when Mr Ingham came into those</l>
					<l>parts but soon after went to live with my</l>
					<l>Mother; she asked me to go with her to</l>
					<l>hear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham preach, but I declined it</l>
					<l>for this reason, I believect if I was one of</l>
					<l>his followers I must denounce the World,</l>
					<l>which was my chief Object at that time,</l>
					<l>soon after he came again to preach nearer</l>
					<l>to our habitation) will Mother urged me to</l>
					<l>go with her which I could not now help</l>
					<l>complying with, tho spiritually clear-</l>
					<l><del>&amp;</del> the discourses had no effect &amp; I wondered</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>what induced people to run after him:</l>
					<l>my Mother invited him to preach at our</l>
					<l>House but he did chuse to do it except we</l>
					<l>would have a Society setted to which she</l>
					<l>consented. In the mean time my Mother</l>
					<l>spoke very closely to me about the state.</l>
					<l>of my Soul; thus prepared I went to hear</l>
					<l>him again. During his Sermon, I was made</l>
					<l>sensible of my lost condition, I wished I could</l>
					<l>alter &amp; thought I had better be deprived of</l>
					<l>this Worlds pleasure then lose my immor</l>
					<l>tal Soul. I thought I could part with every</l>
					<l>thing I had in the World to be assured of</l>
					<l>may salvation, but feared it was impossible </l>
					<l>In this miserable state I continued a long</l>
					<l>time, &amp; came into selfworking by degrees</l>
					<l>my misery wore off &amp; concluded this was</l>
					<l>the right way to do all the good that was</l>
					<l>in my power so my confidence was to be</l>
					<l>appeased, but being of a hasty temper &amp;</l>
					<l>sometimes overcome with passion my good</l>
					<l>opinion of myself vanished &amp; I became mi</l>
					<l>serable again. In the year 1740. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ing</l>
					<l>ham &amp; B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tellsheg came to our house. the</l>
					<l>latter could not speak English, but his look</l>
					<l>made a particular impression on me &amp; I</l>
					<l>believed him to be indeed a Child of God.</l>
					<l>In a short time after his visit our Society,</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
<cb></cb>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>was dispersed, which troubled me very much</l>
					<l>One of them &amp; myself desired desired to be</l>
					<l>admitted into another Society, which was</l>
					<l>the case soon after with a small company</l>
					<l>at Hollbeck near Leeds. But not having</l>
					<l>the pleasure to see B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> often, I grew dry</l>
					<l>in my heart Upon being asked to be a</l>
					<l>Servant in a Family, I at first refused but</l>
					<l>being earnestly intreated, I at last accepted</l>
					<l>&amp; went to the place. I was soon uneasy in it</l>
					<l>for I found I had no freedom to mix with</l>
					<l>worldly company, but was obliged to stay</l>
					<l>my time out. The night before I left my</l>
					<l>place I <del>opened</del> drew that Verse &amp; When I</l>
					<l>was lost &amp; far had strayed Into a Desart</l>
					<l>wild etc. The day after when I was with</l>
					<l>my Mother, some Sisters came to see me,</l>
					<l>I told them what had passed, they act advised</l>
					<l>me to make a new begining, &amp; then our</l>
					<l>Saviour &amp; the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> would forgive me. These</l>
					<l>words comforted me for I did not expect</l>
					<l>to hear such of them. The first meeting</l>
					<l>after their visit that I went to, B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tellsheg</l>
					<l>kept on the following words, ye cannot</l>
					<l>serve two Masters. it seemed as if he di-</l>
					<l>rected his discourse to me alone and </l>
					<l>no determined have our Saviour for</l>

				<lg>
					<l>my Master &amp; him alone. The short time</l>
					<l>after I was advised to live with two Sisters</l>
					<l>in Hollbeck I did so, but my sittuation was</l>
					<l>not at first agreable to me, I did not</l>
					<l>remain long with them, being desired by</l>
					<l>B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Teltsheg to go to Leeds to wait on a</l>
					<l>Sick Sister, but soon became sick myself</l>
					<l>as I had then no money left to help me the</l>
					<l>future I was persuaded to live my Mother </l>
					<l>with whom I remained till she died.</l></lg></p>
<p><lg>
					<l>The day before her departure, a Sister</l>
					<l>visited her &amp; asked her where she would</l>
					<l>like to have me sittuated; she replyed</l>
					<l>amongst Sisters, But after her Death</l>
					<l>I felt such a strong attachment to my</l>
					<l>Relations that I thought I could not part</l>
					<l>with them which brought me again into trou</l>
					<l>ble, &amp; quite at a loss what to do. When I was</l>
					<l>by myself, my faithful Moniter convinced</l>
					<l>me once more that I was not in my right</l>
					<l>place to stay there would be dangerous</l>
					<l>for my Soul. I immediately set off to ac=</l>
					<l>quaint my former Labouress, &amp; disclosed</l>
					<l>my whole case. She recommended me to</l>
					<l>another Family in Hollbeck, this was in</l>
					<l>the year 1750. I attended the Preaching</l>
					<l>in Fulneck every Sunday, B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> LaTrobe</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
<cb></cb>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Sermons were a real blessing to me, &amp; I</l>
					<l>frequent imagined, that he know my in-</l>
					<l>most thoughts. I had no rest day, nor</l>
					<l>night, on account of the burden of my</l>
					<l>sins. One day as I was by myself ear-</l>
					<l>nestly entreating our Saviour to mani=</l>
					<l>fest himself unto me, he granted my re</l>
					<l> quest &amp; gave me a full assurance of the</l>
					<l>forgiveness of my sins which came with</l>
					<l>such power, that it melted me into tears</l>
					<l>from this time &amp; particularly during my</l>
					<l>stay in that Family, I received many</l>
					<l>blessings form our Saviour. This was also</l>
					<l>a particular period with the Brethren's</l>
					<l>Congregation, their enemies in these parts</l>
					<l>were not affraid to prognosticate their</l>
					<l>ruin, notwithstanding this I wished for a</l>
					<l>still closer union with them, &amp; importuned</l>
					<l>to be admitted a Member of the Congregation.</l>
					<l>The two S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> with whom I lived having departed</l>
					<l>this life it was thought proper for me to</l>
					<l>leave Hollbeck, &amp; I was placed at last to my</l>
					<l>great joy in the Single Sisters Oeconomy at</l>
					<l>gummersall, May 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1755 &amp; was soon at</l>
					<l>hone with them, tho' it proved a new school</l>

			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/FUL_SS_41_Craven_Sarah-04.jpg" n="4"></pb>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>for my heart. The 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of March 1756 I was in</l>
					<l>formed would be a general Congregation Day</l>
					<l>I got an impression that on that day I should</l>
					<l>have the favour to be added thereto. I there</l>
					<l>fore kept a band with our Saviour, sensitive</l>
					<l>of my poverty &amp; helplessness, yet comforted</l>
					<l>with his nearess. In this sittuation of mind</l>
					<l>according to my impression, I was received</l>
					<l>into the Congregation on the above mentioned</l>
					<l>day which proved a great blessing to me</l>
					<l>Thus for her own account</l></lg></p>
<p><lg>
					<l>April 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1756 our late Sister removed</l>
					<l>from Gumersal to live in the Choir House</l>
					<l>here. March 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1757 she partook with</l>
					<l>the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of the holy Comunion for the</l>
					<l>first time. It was evident, notwithstand</l>
					<l>ing all human imperfections that she</l>
					<l>had found her peace in our Saviour.</l></lg></p>
<p><lg>
					<l>She knew in whom she believed and was</l>
					<l>persuaided that he was able to keep</l>
					<l>that which she had commited to Him.</l>
					<l>which helped her through evry trying</l>
					<l>circumstance she met with. her call</l>
					<l>to belong to a Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of those she valued</l>
					<l>highly and often spoke of it with the greatest</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
<cb></cb>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>greatest gratitude. It was a particuliar</l>
					<l>pleasure to her to serve her Sisters in</l>
					<l>any little matters she was able to do,</l>
					<l>which she did with great faithfullness</l>
					<l>so long as her Strength wou'd admitt</l>
					<l>of it. The begining of this year an</l>
					<l>Asthmatick complaint which she had</l>
					<l>labourd under many Years, grew very</l>
					<l>troublesom to her, so that she was obliged</l>
					<l>in Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> to moove into the sickroom,</l>
					<l>when her longing to be at home with our</l>
					<l>Saviour increased daily. It gave her much</l>
					<l>pain when two of her companions in the</l>
					<l>sickroom was called home before her.</l>
					<l>She suffer'd much in her Sickness which</l>
					<l>made her sometimes rather impatient</l>
					<l>and think the time long, but she wou'd</l>
					<l>soon recolect herself again, and intreated</l>
					<l>our Saviour to give her a childlike resig</l>
					<l>nation to his will that she might not</l>
					<l>grieve him by her impatience.</l></lg></p>
<p><lg>
					<l>the night before her departure, she said</l>

					<l>said, I am waiting for our Saviour to</l>
					<l>come and fetch me, he will not be long</l>
					<l>now before he comes, I shall then see</l>
					<l>him for myself sickness &amp; Sorrow will</l>
					<l>have an end, he will wipe all tears</l>
					<l>from my Eyes, that night She spent</l>
					<l>in great Weakness, but in converce</l>
					<l>with her best Friend, Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></l>
					<l>the happy moment came when she</l>
					<l>departed in a soft and easy maner</l>
					<l>to her dear Redeemer with the</l>
					<l>blessing of her Choir, half past</l>
					<l>10 oClock in the forenoon, during</l>
					<l>a Sincible feeling of our dear Lords</l>
					<l>presents, in the 72<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Year of her</l>
