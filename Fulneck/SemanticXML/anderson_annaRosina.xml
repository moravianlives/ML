               <p> Our dear happily departed sister <persName ref="#mlper000215">Anna Rosina Anderson</persName>, has
                  left the following account of herself: I was born the <date when-iso="1727-08-09">9th of Aug 1727</date>
                  at <placeName ref="#mlpla000026">Berthelsdorf</placeName>. My Parents belonging to <orgName>the
                     Cong</orgName> endeavoured to bring me up in the same connection with
                     <orgName>the Cong.</orgName> and send me from my earliest years every Sunday
                  to<placeName ref="#mlpla000001"> Herrnhut</placeName> to the Children’s meeting, which the
                     <persName>late Count Zinzendorf</persName> kept. He asked me many questions,
                  and tho I did not always understand him, yet it made an impression on my heart and
                  I felt a <name type="emotion">desire to be happy</name>. When I was in my <date when-iso="1734" cert="medium">7th year</date> my father departed happily
                  to <persName type="diety">our savior</persName>, after which the <persName>late
                     Count</persName> took care of my mother and her children; She came to live in
                  the <placeName>widow’s house</placeName> at <placeName ref="#mlpla000001">Herrnhut</placeName>. </p>
            </div>

               <p> and her children in the <placeName>Orphan house</placeName>, but I for my part had no inclination for
                  it, but chose to stay with my Grand father in <placeName ref="#mlpla000026">Berthelsdorf</placeName>.
                  After a few years my uncle in <placeName ref="#mlpla000053">Lobenstein</placeName> desired me to come
                  and live with him, which I was very glad of. I was there above a year, but did not
                  find it so agreeable as I thought, and I <name type="emotion">prayed many times with tears</name> to
                     <persName type="diety">the Lord</persName>, to help me away again, which he graciously did,
                  For it happened at this time that the <persName>late Count</persName> came to
                  <placeName ref="#mlpla000036">Ebbersdorf</placeName> and my uncle had an opportunity to see him;
                  and told him that I was very unhappy here; on hearing this he took me under his
                  care and sent me to <placeName ref="#mlpla000057">Marienborn</placeName> to the <placeName>Orphan house</placeName> I prayed
                  to <persName type="diety">the Lord</persName> to preserve me here and <name type="emotion">make
                     me happy</name>, and that I never might come to any <cb/>/// any other place
                  except among <orgName>the Brethren</orgName>, because I was sometimes enticed by
                  my uncle to go back with him to his home. At that time during a <name
                     health="disease">severe sickness</name> which I get, I learned to pray earnestly
                  for my happiness. I found many friends here who wished me well and to see me
                  prosper for our <persName type="diety">savior</persName>; particularly one sister will always be remembered by me,
                  who, when I had recovered, took me with her into the garden, and kneeling down
                  with me, sent up a fervent prayer in my behalf to<persName type="diety"> our Savior</persName>,
                  which I shall never forget. But it was not sufficient to make me happy; because I
                  must feel <persName type="diety">my savior's</persName> comfort and forgiveness for my own
                  heart and this happiness in a very particular manner. Being once quite alone in a
                  place I fell down at his feet and implored his mercy and forgiveness for all my
                  sins through his precious blood.at that time, I felt something, which I cannot
                  express, his comfort to my troubled soul and his mercy shown to one, </p>

               <p> [illegible] IN the year <date when-iso="1741">1741</date> I was received into <orgName en="single sisters choir">the Great
                     Girls Choir</orgName> and in the same year I enjoyed the <name event="communion">holy Communion</name> for the
                  first time, which was an unspeakable blessing to my heart. At that time there was
                  a company of great girls which <persName>the late Count</persName> took par-
                  ticular care of, he kept us Choir meetings and instructed us how to become useful
                  in <persName type="diety">our Savior</persName>'s service. I was appointed to keep the
                  Children's and great girls bands , and enjoyed many blessings from <persName type="diety">our
                     Savior</persName>, when we spoke together of his great love and mercy. Soon
                  after I had the office of an assistant among <cb/>/// the Children conferred upon
                  me and moved in the same year with this Oeco- nomy to
                  <placeName ref="#mlpla000014">Herrnhaag</placeName>. All these appointments taught me to come into
                  closer connection with <persName type="diety">our Savior</persName> and showed me that I could
                  do nothing of myself. His mercy and love shown to me bowed me in the dust before
                  him. I had the confidence to cleave to him as a poor sinner, and believed he would
                  help me thro'. <date when-iso="1743">1743</date> I was <roleName de="accoluth">accepted an acoluth</roleName> with a large company,
                  which encouraged me anew to live to him and serve him as a poor Child that has
                  nothing to plead but his mercy from day to day. <date when-iso="1744">1744</date> I was received

                  not enjoy it in such a manner as I wished to do. I had to struggle, particularly
                  in the beginning with many difficulties, being young and unexperienced, and had no
                  body to whom I could open my heart and consult with, so as I wished; which made it
                  sometimes very heavy to me. But my dear <persName type="diety">savior</persName>
                  helped me through whenever I turned to him in my distress. I visited frequently in
                  the most of the country congress which lay very distant from each other. In the

                  war broke out between the French and English, and as the indians generally took
                  share and joined one of the other party, we had very difficult time at <placeName

                     <placeName>Bethlehem</placeName> was destroyed by the Indians, where 11
                  Brothers and Sisters lost their lives, after which many mur-ders were committed
                  much nearer, till at last within 6 miles of <placeName ref="#mlpla000002"
                     >Bethlehem</placeName>. We knew that we were closely watched by the Indians who
                  would gladly have destroyed the place which at that time was the only one capable
                  of making any resistance to their Incursion. The reports of their cruelties at
                  other places kept us in continual <name type="emotion">alarm and
                     apprehension</name>, particularly as Indians were sometimes observed to lurk
                  about and in the place at nights. However the strict watch kept by <orgName>the
                     Brethren</orgName> in many parts and particularly about our house but above all
                  the protection of <persName type="diety">our good Lord</persName>, always
                  frustrated their designs. During all these heavy times, <persName type="diety">our

                  We had a very quick passage, arrived in <placeName>London</placeName> the

                  where I stayed about a year, and then got a call to

                  expressed a wish for Benade to pray with her at her departure which was now done,
                  and after the prayer the blessing of <persName>the Lord</persName> was pronounced
                  over her. <name type="emotion">The feeling of the peace</name> of god on this

                  that she could only say yes or no to the questions asked. The 18th some sisters
                  assembled in her room to sing some verses expressing our foretaste of that <name

                  gave them all the hand and said: The Lord bless you. Afterwards she slumbered
                  again till about evening, had a very restless night, and the 20th in the morning
                  about 7 o' clock her redeemed and through the blood of Jesus sanctified soul went
