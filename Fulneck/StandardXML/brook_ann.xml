            <lb/>The Course of Life of the Singl<hi rend="superscript:true;">e</hi> Sist<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ann Brook
            <lb/>Of which she has left the following:
            <lb/>I was Born in the Parish of
            <lb/>Birstal, in Yorkshire, and Babtiz'd by B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Held, in Gumersal
            <lb/>Chappel. My parrents took me with them to the meetings
            <lb/>as soon as I cou'd go, and when the school was settled there,
            <lb/>I went to it. B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Watson kept a meeting on this Ocassion to
            <lb/>the Children, Concerning the aim of this School, now begun with
            <lb/>them, wherein I felt our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> very near my heart and the
            <lb/>time I spent amongst the Child<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> as also the meetings were a real
            <lb/>Blessing to me, tho' I was sometimes selfwill'd &amp; Greiv'd the
            <lb/>Sist<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> who kept the school, In my 13 year I was Recd into the
            <lb/>Great Girls Choir which was also a Blessing to me. My desire
            <lb/>now was to go to live with the Sist<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>, but Circumstances not
            <lb/>permitting me at that time, I got into a more indiferent way,
            <lb/>and rather got a likeing to the world, which my Parrents
            <lb/>Perceiving with Concern, Sought Admission for me to
            <lb/>the Oeconomy, which was granted soon, and I accordingly
            <lb/>mov'd into The Little Moor Oeconimy Sept<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> ye 3 1768
            <lb/>I was verry thankfull for it, and felt myself Quite at home
            <lb/>from the very first, but my Disposition being very hasty,
            <lb/>Caus'd me often some uneasiness, as I did not know how to be
            <lb/>a Sinner and as such to come thro', I spoke to the the Sist<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>
            <lb/>Concerning this my trouble, and found thro' their advice, Comfort
            <lb/>and Satisfaction from our Saviour. In my 17 year I was Recd
            <lb/>into the Sist<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Choir, which prov'd a new School for my heart,
            <lb/>wherein I wish'd to spend my time more to Our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Satisfaction
            <lb/>then I had done in my Girls years, being now more and more
            <lb/>Conscious of my own Poverty, which made the Grace bestow'd
            <lb/>on me the Greater, When to my Great Joy I was recd into the
            <lb/>Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> Feb<hi rend="superscript:true;">ry</hi> ye 26 1769
            </p>
            <pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_69_Brook_Ann-02.jpg" n="2"/>
            <p>
            <lb/>This Bow'd me in the dust before my dearest Saviour, that he cou'd
            <lb/>So graciously accept such a One as I was, and the favour Granted
            <lb/>me Sept<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> ye 8 1771 when I was Spectator at the Holy Communion
            <lb/>Confirm'd my Confidence in him, that he would Bring me to the
            <lb/>full injoyment of his dear Person, and all he had Merited
            <lb/>for me
            <lb/>Thus for our Late Sist<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Own Account
            <lb/>She took her illness in the beggining of Nov<hi rend="superscript:true;">br</hi> 1771 which we
            <lb/>thought to be a bad Cold, but linger'd for some time without
            <lb/>much alteration till in the beggining of December, when she Grew
            <lb/>worse, She had Spent her time in stillness so far concerning
            <lb/>her illness, but then told her Sist<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>, that she had spoken
            <lb/>with Our Saviour, about all her matters, what had past
            <lb/>before She came here, as well as Since, Of which she mentiond
            <lb/>Several Particulars, Saying, I wou'd not have any thing left
            <lb/>betwixt my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> and me, Being ask'd if She believ'd
            <lb/>Our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> wou'd take her to himself at this time, She said,
            <lb/>It is not yet clear to me, but I feel Quite Resign'd, I feel
            <lb/>nothing betwixt him and me that disturbs me, and added
            <lb/>if there is still any thing left, I cou'd like him to show it me,
            <lb/>that so nothing might hinder me from the injoyment of him
            <lb/>Her Longing after the injoyment of the Lords Body and Blood
            <lb/>in the Holy Sacrament seemed to be now her only concern.
            <lb/>Which she injoy'd on the 10 of December, to her great Joy,
            <lb/>She lay Quite still for a Considerable time, look'd quite Chearfull
            <lb/>and Satisfied, her Serene Countenance bespoke the sencible injoyment
            <lb/>she felt of her Dearest Lords nearness, which she express'd
            <lb/>by saying; What a good and Loving Saviour have I;
            <lb/>The next Day she Lay very still, till in the night when her
            <lb/>pain was very Violent, During which she often pray'd
            </p>
            <pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_69_Brook_Ann-03.jpg" n="3"/>
            <p>
            <lb/>Our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to help her, and Preserve her Sences, towards
            <lb/>Morning she grew a little Delirous but all she said was
            <lb/>about our sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> and how happy she was in Him, which
            <lb/>her look at the same time testified to all around her, she
            <lb/>had intervals when her pain a little abated that she came
            <lb/>More to herself, On the 14 the Choir Helper, Blest her to
            <lb/>her happy departure, during an inexpressible feeling of Our
            <lb/>D<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> nearness, she grew weaker and weaker, and was
            <lb/>not able to say much, But, ;O come D<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> take me;
            <lb/>the Sooner the Better; and thus Continued looking out
            <lb/>with longing for the Happy Moment; till on the 18 in
            <lb/>the Morning between 8 and 9 oclock, her happy soul
            <lb/>took flight into the Arms of her Eternal Bridegroom
            <lb/>in the 20<hi rend="superscript:true;">th </hi>year of her age, with a sweet feeling
            <lb/>of the Peace of God
