					Brief Notices concerning the life and
					happy departure from this world into eternity
					of the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">gle</hi> S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Marianne Spence who fell asleep
					in Jesus on Monday Morning. June the 18<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">th</hi> 1866
					at Fulneck.
				</p>
			<p>
					Our late Sister was born on October the 10<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">th</hi> 1844 at the Mission
					Station of Bethabara in the Island of Jamaica where her parents
					laboured in the Lords Vineyard as esteemed and useful servants of the Brethrens Church. From her very birth and more
					especially on the day of her baptism on November the 24<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">th</hi> she
					was by them dedicated unto the Shepherd and Bishop of our
					souls as His redeemed property with the fervant prayer that
					He himself would tend and keep her as one of his sheep
					This prayer was answered; for the Lord our Saviour was ever
					mindful of her and through the days of her childhood youth
					and to the very end of her sojourn here below manifestly led
					her with his rod and staff. The blessed name of Jesus she
					learnt to know and to love from her earliest years. Brought up
					as a little child in the nurture and admonition of the Lord
					under the parental roof she early learnt to love the house, and
					the word of the Lord, and to pray. She was naturally not of a
					robust constitution a weakness in her chest was perceptible
					even in her youngest years tho' as far as I can hear she never
					materially suffered from this cause at that time. In the
					year 1851 her late father brought her and her older sister here
					to Fulneck for education. She remained for 8 years a pupil
					of the Ladies Boarding school here and throughout the whole
					period approved herself a well conducted obedient, &amp; attentive
					scholar who by her gentleness, and amiable peaceful disposition
					gained the love alike of her superiors and companions. Her
					natural abilities although not of a very striking and superior
					character were such as to render her aided by her diligence
					and perseverance a very efficient scholar. Her health was
					upon the whole pretty good during this period although she
					never was very strong and her rapid growth and tall slender figure
					often made her an object of notice to those who knew her age
					This was particularly the case when she was received into
					the Girls Choir in the year 1854. She was of a very placid
					disposition and did not freely speak about herself and her
					spiritual life, but it was very evident that she grew in grace
					as well as in stature and with the lessons of secular wisdom
					diligently learnt the lessons of heavenly wisdom that made
					her wise unto salvation Those to whom her spiritual culture
					was more especially entrusted often observed with much pleasure her serious department and manifest relish for eternal
					truths and heavenly pleasures. She ever meekly &amp; thankfully
					received the spiritual advice of her labouress towards whom

				she always cherished feelings of grateful esteem and sincere
				affection. In the autumn of 1854 she removed to the Ladies School
				at Neuwied where she remained for two years. Here she enjoyed
				the faithful and efficient instructions of B<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; subscript:true;">r</hi> Menzel preparatory,
				to her confirmation at Easter 1861, on which occasion she surrendered
				herself anew to the Lord her Saviour who had been the God of her
				childhood imploring him to be with her throughout her youth
				and even for ever. From the School at Neuwied she proceeded
				to Montmirail in autumn 1861, where after another years instructions she completed her schooldays and at once was engaged
				upon her return to England to enter into the ladies School at
				Gomersal. She had previously at Montmirail been received into
				the choir of Single Sisters, &amp; now forthwith began to trade with
				the talents her Saviour had entrusted to her keeping. For
				above three years she faithfully discharged the important duties
				of a teacher of the young. How her services were appreciated may
				be best learnt from the following letters received by me from
				B<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">r</hi> K, and S<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">r</hi> R (--) At Easter this year she came home for a
				few days to her mother. A severe cold prevented her from returning immediately after the Easter vacation to her sphere of
				duty. She hoped a few days rest and careful nursing at home
				might restore her health. But when this hope was blighted her
				desire was to return upon her duties at any rate at the middle
				of the quarter, and when this also was denied her, she at first
				greatly felt her inability to return to her post where she was
				so happy and so beloved. But as she had been a willing and
				useful teacher, she now once again was willing to be an attentive
				and obedient scholar. The Lord wished her to learn how to give
				up all for Him and die happily.-- It was truly edifying to
				witness, the perfect resignation with which our dear Sister
				acquiesced in the will of the Lord and how calmly and content
				edly she submitted her wishes and her will to his over ruling
				gracious providence. It was not the natural placidity of her
				temper nor apathy which enabled her thus to be resigned and
				quiet. For she herself keenly felt the pang of seperation from
				her beloved mother and other dear relatives and friends, and her
				affectionate disposition made her anticipate the grief her mother
				would have to endure by her early removal. But she knew her
				Saviour, who had given her a heart to know him, that He is the
				Lord and she believed that He did all things well she trusted
				Him and therefore could confidently commit herself and her
				dear friends into this most faithful hands. It soon became manifest that rapid consumption would speedily terminate her course
				through life, and as the complaint gained ground from week to
				week, she ripened more and more for heaven and eternal glory.
				She bore her sufferings with exemplary patience, her deafness
				occasionally caused the sorrow casting a momentary gloom over

					her bright hopes of eternal joys. In general her mind was kept
					in perfect peace stayed upon the Lord. Whenever asked respecting
					the ground of her hope, or her prospects for eternity, she expressed simple childlike confidence in her beloved Saviour. He was near to her
					indeed even Christ in her, the hope of glory. There was no triumphant rejoicing in her last illness and death, but there was the work
					of righteousness, peace, and there was the effect of righteousness, even
					quietness and assurance for ever, and there was joy, the joy unspeakable and full of glory. Her own set in the serene horizon of God's love
					after a calm bright day of genial summer. We do not here dwell
					at length upon those utterances of her last days and hours, which
					are the sacred property of her sorrowing mother and will no doubt
					cheer her often in the remembrance of the past when the loss of
					her beloved child would otherwise overwhelm her with grief
					But we magnify the grace of God that enabled our late Sister every
					to desire to depart and be with Christ which is far better than the
					possession and enjoyment of all temporal treasures here below.
					Our Saviour was very gracious unto her sparing her the conflict of
					a painful separation of soul and body.-- She literally fell asleep in
					Jesus, and slept herself away into eternity. Her ransomed spirit
					fled from the frail tabernacle, early on Monday morning last; to join
					the spirits of just men made perfect Her end was peace. Her age
					was 21 years 8 months, and 8 days.
