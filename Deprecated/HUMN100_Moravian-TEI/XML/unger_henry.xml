                  their Heart
                  
                  Departed this Life.
                  
                  I. I. Henr. Unger as Ober Peyle the 3 of this Month.
                  He was born the 25th of Jan. 1721 at Berthelsdorf
                  Our Saviour made a Pretension on his Heart from
                  his youth and he was embarrassed how to become
                  happy but did not know how to find Rest for 
                  his poor Soul, till at last he hear by the Brethren
                  in Peterswalde of our Saviours Love to poor Sinners
                  became thereby convinced &amp; deplored grace through his
                  Wounds. He was as well in relation to his Body as his
                  Mind a object of commiseration. By all that
                  our saviour bestowed Mercy on him and he was
                  Ao 1746 the 29th of Jan. in our congregation 
                  received. Few years after he became indifferent
                  and by &amp; by hardhearted, so that the Brethren 
                  were forced to excommunicate him from their 
                  Society &amp; let him go on in his own Ways.
                  Ao 1750 he marryed Ana Rosine Shabel &amp; 
                  with three children, one of them is gone home &amp;
                  two are in the care of the congregation.
                  After that he returned again very perplexed about his 
                  Misdeed 
               </p>

            <div type="page" n="2">
               <head>Page 2 <seg ana="MemBeth_0139-02" />
               </head>
               <p>
                  misdeed and begged forgiveness with many fears, 
                  and desireth the Congregation would intercide 
                  by our Saviours, to bestow mercy on him, as
                  a poor creature who brought all they miserys
                  and unhappiness on himself. Our Saviour
                  mercy as he is granted his desire and gave leave
                  to absolve him from all his sins!
                  1752 the 9th of April he got the grace to partake
                  on our Lords Supper, whereby his heart melted
                  with 1000 tears. The 20th October he got leave
                  to move to Ober Peile and soon to Gnadenfrey.
                  But in the time following he came here in such a 
                  Confusion of hind and a distraction of his senses
                  that he removed to Ober Peyle again. But our
                  Saviour whose eye was fixed on him didnt forsake
                  him, but showed mercy on him again, he
                  bowed down as a sinner for his feet and in so
                  he was readmitted again to the graces of the
                  Congregation. Since two year he became quite
                  Contract [sic], so that he neither go or stirr, every
                  Brother who came to see him was a real comfort
                  to him, however our Saviour and his Congregation
                  shortened and diminished his bodly Pain and smart.
                  Several days passed his end seemed to be pretty near,
                  so that he was not more able to speak,  but he
                  recovered himself and said: poor as I am! One view
                  in his wounds can bring me again, but as a sinner
                  ///
                  I'll go home. Today a Brethern came to so see him and he was
                  just on the Brink of to go home, he sung some
                  verses under which he went to our Saviour in
                  the 43. Year of his Age.
                  II The marryed Sister Rosine Taneberger.
                  She was Ao. 1708 born at Mankendorf in Moravia.
                  Her Vaters name was Geo. Weber. The holy
                  ghost had from her tender youth his work in
                  her Heart and she spent her time continually
                  without rest in her soul. In her 25th year
                  of Age she marryed Michel Taneberger. She
                  2 boys with him but they died very young. She
                  very often pineth to hear the gospel of Jesus
                  sufferings of Death, therefore she often begged dear
                  God to slice her Desire and help her to a Place where
                  she could find rest for her poor soul, then she could
                  not find that in her Mother Country. Ao. 1753 the 13th October
                  she got a feeling in her Heart to move to Gnaden 
                  frey, they happened as much as possible and leaped
                  hardly from their Pursers. The 31 of Dec. 
                  the arrived here very much rejoyced. Soon after
                  a critical occasion pretty nearly persuadeth
                  her Husband to remove from here to his son.
                  She therefore was so embarassed and intreated our
                  Saviour in her perplexity saying: Scarce my Heart catched a part
                  of grace, and instead to become a fire he will be quenched.
