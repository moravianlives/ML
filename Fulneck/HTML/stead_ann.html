    <p> The Life of the mar<sup>d</sup>. Sr<a href="#mlper000568.html">Ann stead</a>who departed <br /> to her Redeemer <em>June 13<sup>th</sup> 1772</em></p>
    <p> She herself dictated the following to her Husband. </p>
    <p> I was born at <a href="#mlpla000135.html">Bradford</a> March 28<sup>th</sup> 1730 &amp; educated in the <br />Church of England. I grew up in a very careless manner<br /> having no particular
      thoughts or Concern about my Salva- <br /> tion. In the Year <em>1750</em>I was married to my present <br /> Husband who belonged to the Brethren's Society, but being <br />gay &amp; liking the
      world &amp; the ways thereof, I was much against his going to the B<sup>rns</sup> Meetings, which occasioned <br /> him to speak very seriously <sup>tho tenderly</sup> with me when he told me
      <br /> his Reasons for going among the Brethren, &amp; that he for him, <br /> self was determined to continue his Connexion with them <br /> &amp; adhere to the Doctrine he had heard of them,
      but would <br /> give me full liberty to go to divine Service <br /> wherever I chose. I was not satisfied long to go a dif- <br /> ferent way to my husband, &amp; moreover seeing something
      <br /> more in him than I saw in myself &amp; many others I was <br /> drawn to go with him. In <em>1751</em>we moved to <a href="#mlpla000090.html">Pudsey</a> where <br /> I not only attended
      the Meetings of the B<sup>rn</sup> but also got <br /> reacquainted with them to the blessingof my Heart, &amp; soon <br /> after was received into the Society. About this Time <br /> our
        Sav<sup>r</sup> began to labour powerfully on my Heart, &amp; <br /> particularly did He make it clear to me what a wretched <br /> miserable Sinner I was, &amp; I continued for some Time in
      <br />great distress of Soul, not knowing what to do or how <br /> I should be helped. In this Condition I once went in great <br /> Heaviness to a Meeting which <a href="#mlper000655.html"
          >B<sup>r</sup> Parminter</a> held, during <br /> which the Lordmanifested Himself to my Heart in his <br /> bloody Form just so as He expired on the Cross, and He <br /> asured me that He
      had blotted out all my Sins &amp; received <br /> me as by Child. This was an Hour of grace that has never </p>

    <p> since been erased out of my Mind. Now I was full of joy<br /> &amp;
      Thankfulnes for the mercy He had shown to my Soul. &amp; <br /> ever since He has given me that grace that all Times <br /> &amp; amidst the farther knowlege I had of my own Depravity <br /> I
      could always go confidently to Him with all my Concerns<br /> &amp; cast myself with them upon his merciful Heart &amp; He <br /> has approved Himself gracious &amp; faithful to me. <em>Jan:
          6<sup>th</sup><br /> 1757</em> I was rec<sup>d</sup> into the Cong<sup>n</sup> during an overpowering <br /> feeling of our Sav<sup>rs</sup> Love which melted my Heart in such <br /> a
      Manner as I am not able to express. <em>apr. 18<sup>th</sup> 1761</em> I was <br />admitted to the holy Communion, which grace made me <br /> deeply ashamed, feeling my great unworthiness. This
      <br /> caused me to examine more strictly into <br /> my own Heart, &amp; which also proved the Occasion of my <br />diving still deeper into for Heart of Love &amp; experiencing <br /> more of
      the grace which He had in Store for me. <br /></p>
    <p> So far her own Account. </p>
    <p> She had a tender Heart to our Sav<sup>r</sup> &amp; spent her <br /> Time in Communion with Him. Her marriage was <br /> blest with 10 Children 5 of whom went Home before <br /> her. She was
      in a poor state of Health before the <br /> Birth of her last child in January &amp; has never been <br /> well since then. In her Sickness her Children lay<br /> upon her Mind with much
      Concern, &amp; she was <sup>exceedingly</sup><br />pained at thinking how it might go with them, but <br /> was obliged to commit them to the Mercy of <a href=".html">God</a><br /> She was
      tenderly occupied with our Sav<sup>r</sup> <sup>and what He had done for her</sup> &amp; had no Incli- <br /> nation for Conversation about any other Subject, but <br /> was all alive whenever
      He was spoken or sung of. The <br /> time of her Sickness was a Season of real grace &amp; Blessing</p>

    <p>to her Heart, &amp; on extraordinary presence of our
      <br />Sav<sup>r</sup> was perceived by all the B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; S<sup>rs</sup> whenever <br /> they visited her, which made it a comfort &amp; Blessing to <br /> them. Her whole Mind was
      bent upon going Home, <br /> Being asked if she should not like to recover again <br /> she replied: "O no! I would mend again for a 1000 worlds." <br /> Being asked by some of her Neighbours,
      if she was not <br /> afraid to die, &amp; whether she had no dark apprehen- <br /> sion at the Thoughts of being soon in Eternity? <br /> She answered: "no, I have neither Fear nor dark <br />
      apprehensions, but can resign my Soul to my <br />Sav<sup>r</sup> with joy &amp; with the same <sup>composure</sup> &amp; serenity as when <br /> I go to sleep at Nights because He has granted
      me <br /> the Happiness to know Him as my Friend &amp; Redeemer." </p>
    <p> She had the holy Communion administred to her <br /> twice in her House, attended with an extraordinary <br /> Feeling of grace. Thus she remained, an Edifica: <br /> to those who saw &amp;
      spoke with her, till it pleased<br /> our Sav<sup>r</sup> to fetch her Soul to Himself in her 43<sup>d</sup> Year. </p>PAGE BREAK</body>
