					A. E. Marychurch
					After a careful search through my dear
					Sisters papers I regret to say, that we
					have been unable to find any distinct
					memory of her past life, there are various
					short diaries written even in a very early
					period of her life containing statements
					of deep religious feeling, and ever spiritual experience, but she seems to have
					shrunk from the last of compiling
					any thing like a regular memoir.
					What she declined to do for herself from
					a feeling a rising probably from her extreme humility her brother and her
					friends have endeavoured in some degree to supply. Her life was not crowded with exciting events, yet it was
					one of unusual usefulness, and her
					energies became more active as her
					bodily strength declined; her light shone
					more &amp; more until she reached the
					perfect day. Ann Elizabeth Marychurch
					was born Sep<hi rend="superscript:true;">tr</hi> 24<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1804 &amp; was baptized
					in the Brethrens Church in Bristol
					Thus her earthly course began in that

					Church which she loved through
					life more than any other portion
					of Gods heritage, she enbibid its spirit
					in early childhood and cherished it
					to the last. Her parents were esteemed
					members of the Congregation &amp; her
					Father was for many years, most
					faithfully zealous and active in promoting its interests. On the mater-
					nal side, her Grandmother was one
					of the first members when the Congregation was settled in 1755. She was
					brought up by a very affectionate and
					tender mother who trained her early
					in the ways of Gods people. In due
					time she was sent to school, but her
					School days were not happy, she 
					suffered much from those peculiar
					school troubles which are often very
					keenly felt by young sensitive children, - speaking of her school days
					she once said I was a poor little timid
					thing and the unkind ridicule
					of some of the older girls made me

					very unhappy, and pressed down my
					spirits, so that my childhood was not
					so happy as it might have been.
					Her mother being an invalid, she became
					very early useful in the family and
					the active habits which were thus
					formed continued through life.
					In 1821 she was confirmed by the Rev<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi>
					D<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi> Okely the minister of the Congrega-
					tion and in 1822 she became a received
					member. A dangerous illness had excited Solemn thought &amp; made her feel it
					right to take these important steps
					but had not at that time received any
					deep religious impressions, she had not
					as yet felt the burden of sin, nor the
					inescpressible love of <hi rend="underline">Jesus.</hi> She was in-
					deed faithful in prayer and had earnest desires that every thought should
					be brought into captivity to Christ. She 
					often retired for prayer, and she wrote
					out a solemn dedication of herself to
					her Saviour, but her heart was not yet 
					decided and she could not yet say

					Lord I will follow thee whither so ever
					thou goeth. But the Holy Spirit led her
					into clearer views of her own ruined state
					by nature, her sinfulness &amp; depravity in 
					the sight of God, and often it later years
					did she bemoan herself almost in the
					language of St. Paul, "O wretched man
					that I am who shall deliver me from
					the body of this death." This deep conviction of the corruption of her heart com-
					bined at times with what she deplored
					as a natural tendency to sceptism
					frequently robbed her soul of the peace
					to be found in simply looking to the
					blood &amp; righteousness of Christ as the
					sinners only hope. It was once of her
					greatest sources of disquietude amounting at times to distracting torment
					that Satan was permitted to infuse
					doubts into her mind of those great
					and sacred truths which she cherished
					most dearly.
				</p>
			<p>
					Possibly her active intellect aided the
					temptation. But he who permitted

					made a way to escape. Her harrased
					mind sought comfort in the word
					of God &amp; in prayer; and through the
					Holy Spirits help she became established
					strengthened &amp; settled in the faith. Still
					through life she at times complained
					of her hardness of heart &amp; slowness to
					believe was "her thorn in the flesh" often
					producing poignant distress, but like
					St Paul she heard the voice of comfort
					saying, "My Grace is sufficient for thee"
					There were however times especially at
					the Holy Comnmunion when she realized
					the saving love of her Lord, &amp; when her
					heart was filled with rapture &amp; joy
					Thus as life progressed she obtained
					deeper spiritual experience -- her faith
					was not a dead faith, but brought 
					forth good fruit. It led her to work
					to work heartity in the Lords service. 
					Her natural energy of character would
					not allow her to rest in inactivity
					She felt religion to be a vital matter
					and she became anscious to communicate

					it. In her early with she was a zealous
					Sunday School teacher, &amp; even in later
					years, when her infermities would have
					proved a sufficient excuse for refusing
					she undertook the Bible Class, when a
					difficulty of supply was experienced. She
					became also a faithful and valued dis-
					trict visitor, first in the Parish of S<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi> James
					under the guidance of the Rev<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> T T Beddulph
					and afterward in the Parish of S<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi> Michael
					Failing health alone compelled her to 
					relinquish these duties, which she had
					performed during many years with
					conscientious regularlity. She took deep
					interest also in the work of the Bible Society
					and faithfully filled the office of Association
					Secretary to the end of her life. In conjunction with the general work of the Bible
					Society, she watched with especial interest
					the origin and growth of the branch
					connected with the Brethrens Congregation in Bristol of which her revered
					Father had been treasurer. These were
					labours of love invigorating her spiritual

					life, and with drawing her mind from
					dwelling too much upon her peculiar
					tendency to despondency to which her
					nervous constitution made her constantly
					liable. But it was especially to the
					advancement of the Brethrens Mission
					in connection with this Congregation
					that she devoted her strength both of body
					&amp; mind. Her persevering self denying
					labours in behalf of this great work
					will not easily be forgotten. For upwards
					of 30 years dating from the early part
					of B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ramftler's ministry in this
					place, she held the office of Secretary
					of the Ladies Association, an office which
					she filled with increasing delight
					&amp; increasing efficiency. In the last
					year of her life she would gladly have
					resigned it into younger &amp; stronger
					hands, but her services were too valuable
					to be lost and she was though with
					difficulty, persuaded to continue them
					And never did her energies flag
					never with drooping health did she
					omit any effort to increase the efficiency
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_82_Ann_Marychurch-08.jpg" n="8" />

					of the branch under her charge to add
					to the comforts of the Missionaries or to
					extend the sphere of their labours.
					Her knowledge of the special circumstances of various Mission Stations
					especially those of the West Indies
					and the peculiar difficulties which
					Missionaries have to encounter, was
					enlarged by an extensive correspondence
					which she held with those devoted
					servants of God; and this intimate
					knowledge of their state she turned
					to good account by enlisting for them
					the sympathise of children of God in
					the various Christian denominations
					around her. She has ceased from her
					blessed labours but her works follow
					her and in many a distant land
					the announcement of her death will
					be received with heartfelt sorrow.
					May the Lord of the Vineyard raise
					up from this Congregation, a suitable
					and devoted successor. These were evidences external to herself that she was
					in possession of true saving Faith
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_82_Ann_Marychurch-09.jpg" n="9" />
			<p>
				
					which in seasons of temptation she
					aometimes doubted. She loved the Lords 
					people of every name and she had a
					heart ever ready to sympathise in their
					joys &amp; sorrows 
				</p>
			<p>
					To her own Church, she was warmly attached. Few have possessed the true
					Brethrens spirit in a larger degree
					She loved the pious practices &amp; habits of
					her Forefathers, she opposed innovation,
					she sorrowed much over what seemed
					to her a declension from the good old ways
					which so beautifully distinguish her Church
					from other less favoured Christian bodies
					Several papers were found in her desk
					in which she had expressed her feelings
					on these subjects
				</p>
			<p>
					Nevertheless she fervently loved the people
					of God amongst whom her lot was cast,
					They were the people of her choice &amp;
					her Church was to her as her earthly
					home. It was the strength of her love
					&amp; attachment to the Brethrens Church,
					which made her peculiarly sensitive
					as to any change in its rites &amp; customs
				
			</p>

					In 1852 her venerable &amp; beloved Father was
					removed from her by sudden death.
					The shock which her nervous system re-
					ceived by this event, she never fully recovered, the great enemy of Souls took
					advantage of her weak state to strengthen
					old doubts and fears and to infuse new
					ones, so that she was at times led to
					question whether she had ever escperienced
					real saving grace. Her condition for a
					time was most unhappy it was evidently in a great degree the result
					of a morbid state of the nervous system
					&amp; excessive bodily weakness. But as her
					heath gradually improved, she was enabled to overcome these temptatous to 
					despondency and to prove more than 
					conqueror through Him that loved her.
					In 1860 her health received another shock
					by the fracture of a leg, whilst on a visit
					at Calne. Under this severe affection, she
					manifested the true spirit of the child
					of God by her extreme patience &amp; resignation
					Indeed all these toubles seemed to ripen
					her for her heavenly home. She even spoke
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_82_Ann_Marychurch-11.jpg" n="11" />
			<p>
				
					of the state of her soul with humility
					and fear, but her faith and love were 
					growing stronger &amp; stronger.
				</p>
			<p>
					In reference to her illness at Calne she wrote
					thus, I feel that I must be satisfied to be
					an invalid, but it is all right, I feel more
					about it for my dear sympathising friends
					than for myself. I only want the work &amp;
					grace of Christ to be more manifested
					within me &amp; by me and my coldness
					&amp; deadness to be absorbed in the warmth
					and life of Christ. Again she wrote in
					prospect of a change for her healths sake:
					"It may do me good if the Lord please,
					but I wish to leave it without any ansciety
					&amp; without a choice, I expect to go halting
					to the end of my days, but I trust a
					cheerful mind &amp; patience will be given
					me." Though so long a sufferer, her death
					seemed to come suddenly. In the summer
					of 1862 she had spent four happy weeks
					with her Brother &amp; Sister in the North
					of England who accompanied her to
					Fulnec
				</p>
			<p>
					She was always cheerful, delighted
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_82_Ann_Marychurch-12.jpg" n="12" />
			<p>
				
					to meet old friends, but withat indicating great bodily weakness, &amp; great difficult-
					ly breathing.
				</p>
			<p>
					On the way homewards she paid a week
					visit to a dear &amp; valued friend in Staffordshire.
				</p>
			<p>
					On her arrival at home, she seemed rather improved in health than otherwise
					by her long journey. But as the winter
					advanced increased symptoms of weakless appeared especially in the region of the heart &amp; the lung.
				</p>
			<p>
					Kind friends were around her one
					especially watched over tenderly &amp; ansciously until the close of life. She received
					also the incessant attention of an attached servant who had lived in her family
					more than 20 years 
				</p>
			<p>
					But God had thoughts of peace concerning her. She had at times expressed fears of death, but she never
					knew what death was, she departed
					in sleep.
				</p>
			<p>
					The above is a sketch of a very uneventful life, but yet one of unususal christi-
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_82_Ann_Marychurch-13.jpg" n="13" />
			<p>
				
					an activity. She possessed a strong
					mind in a very weak body. Her love
					for Christ and for Christ's people was
					great, and her labours in His cause
					were unremitting. She now rests in
					peace, she has realized what she wrote
					in 1860 concerning a happily departed and beloved Sister in Christ. "The
					beloved Saint is with Christ, no longer
					clad in weakness, and faint with suffering, but clothed in the bright robes
					&amp; our Saviour's righteousness, and
					rejoicing in the presence of God for
					ever" We may truly say this of
					herself, she is with that Saviour, for
					whom she felt it an honour to labour/
					Friends will indeed mourn &amp; her
					place on earth may not easily be
					filled up, but we cannot wish to
					bring her back, we would withdraw
					her an instant from the presence of
					Him, with whom there is fulness
					of joy &amp; life for ever more.

					A few loving words of remembrance are
					added to the above by one whose intimate
					association with the beloved Subject of
					this little sketch, renders it a most
					touching but filial duty to add her testimony
					of deep appreciation of and respect for the
					character of one, so justly endeared to all
					who had the privilege of her intimate
					friendship, and perhaps none of those 
					who now tenderly mourn her loss can
					speak of the departed, with so much real
					knowledge of her both as an individual
					&amp; a Christian having shared the same
					home for 13 or 14 years. Her mental
					powers were of no common order. She
					possessed naturally an unusual
					amount of sound judgment fortitude
					&amp; self sacrificing generosity as well as
					consistancy of action, together with a
					true ardour &amp; depth of affection, which
					when once bestowed, was rarely if ever
					withdrawn. As a Christian her light
					shone with unwavering steadfastness,
					though a feeble body and of late shattered

			<p>
				
					nerves, often beclouding her otherwise
					strong mind, giving a morbid tone
					to her own expressions concerning her 
					spiritual experience, but to those who
					had before them such an undeviating
					pattern of consistancy there remained
					nothing, but the precept / speaking
					by escample / "Go ye and do likewise"
					Her humility before God was a marked
					feature of her high attainments in
					the Christian life. In her last letter
					to the writer of those few lines she says
					I feel a mass of sin &amp; weakness: but
					follows on to say, that the all wise, burden bearer will enable her to cast it
					all on Him. <hi rend="underlined:true;">Nearness to her Saviour</hi>
					was the one thing her soul most
					ardently craved. About two months
					ago she wrote. "Do pray dear that the
					Lord may be more near than ever
					He is very gracious, but I want to see
					Him face to face, to touch Him as
					it were." To these remarks little need
					be added to prove that though her
					spiritual life was a warfire, Yet
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_82_Ann_Marychurch-16.jpg" n="16" />
			<p>
				
					that in the apostle's words her weapons
					were not carnal but mighty through
					God to the pulling down of strongholds.
					Of a truth she was clad in the armour
					of God and her spirit was found
					ready waiting When she for the
					last time unconsciously closed her
					eyes in sleep to wake in that glorious
					world, where conflict &amp; strife &amp; suffering
					are known no more.
				</p>
			<p>
					The Church of which our beloved
					one was so devoted a member, had
					paid its tribute to the worthiness of one
					of its brightest ornaments. Yea her
					works do follow her. And we must
					add from our own knowledge that
					its glorious Missionary Society has lost
					in this place its most energetic and
					painstaking supporter. Neither were
					her efforts confined alone to the Moravian
					Church, but her well grounded and
					large hearted Christianity taught
					her that wherever good was to be
					done &amp; she felt called upon to give her

					aid. Hither she went and with all
					her power &amp; even beyond her power worked with loving zeal in her Masters
					cause. Mongst the rest the Ladies
					Association of the British &amp; Foreign 
					Bible Society would warmyly respond
					to the acknowledgment of her most
					valuable and long continued
					help. The Lord ordereth all things 
					well for His children, &amp; it is a comforting thought that this dear Servant
					of God who so often ministered to the
					bids of others, was also herself abundantly comforted both by her intimate
					relatives and friends as well as
					by her Brethren &amp; Sisters in Christ
					and it is especieelly sweet to think,
					that for the last fortnight one was
					constantly beside her administering
					with tender solicitude to her every
					want. These services were continually acknowledged, as were those
					of her faithful servant who has served her with an affectionate interest
