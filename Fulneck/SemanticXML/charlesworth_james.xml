					Personalia of our late d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James Charlsworth
					who enter&apos;d into the Joy of his Lord July 30th 1770.
					Our late dr Br. James Charlesworth has left the following short account
					of some of the most remarkable particular Circumstances of his Life till
					to the year 1753.</p>
					<p>
					I was born at Little Gummersal in the parish of Birstal in the 
					County of York on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1721. And was Educated by my Parents in 
					the principles of the Church of England, in a strict &amp; careful manner, &amp; preserv&apos;d
					from the Seductions w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> many <hi rend="underline">people</hi> <add place="above">youths</add> are expos&apos;d to. When at the Age of
					12 to 14 Years I began to keep company &amp; frequent some of the places
					of Diversions in the World; I never <hi rend="superscript">ed</hi> do it with the same ease &amp;
					Satisfaction w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I saw other people did, but always felt Remorse of
					Conscience, &amp; when I was alone often pray&apos;d to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to have Mercy
					upon me &amp; keep &amp; preserve me from all Sin. At ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> the age of 15, I
					left off all Pleasures &amp; became acquainted with a small Company of Mysticks
					to whom I join&apos;d my Self, Read their Books &amp; became very sober &amp;
					Religious, but found my poor heart wanted something w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I had not.</p>
					<p>
					When I was about 7 years of age (in the Year 1739) I become
					acquainted with the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> at their first coming to Yorkshire, &amp; my dear
					Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> made me sensible of my lost state &amp; condition, &amp; the Misery &amp; Corruption
					of my Nature, &amp; that it was his Blood alone w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> in make me happy,
					&amp; as such a poor Sinner. I fled for Refuge to his wounds &amp; found peace
					thro&apos; the Virtue &amp; power of his merits &amp; Death. In the year 1740 I went
					to Lond<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. I staid some time w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> there, &amp; return&apos;d again to 
					Yorkshire the same year. I was Reced into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Decr: 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 1742
					soon after the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> was establishd here, &amp; was admitted to be a
					Partaker of the Body &amp; Blood of my Crucified Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> July
					6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1743. I was Confirmd as a witness of the sufferings &amp; Atonem<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
					of the Lamb of God by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spangenberg the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Dec the same year
					before w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> had left my Busyness &amp; Relations &amp; went to Live at the

					first S. B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Oeconomy at Holbeck where I continued till the 20
					July 1744, when I was bless&apos;d by imposition of hands to the Office of 
					Vorsteher of the S. B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, after wch I was mostly employd in Preaching &amp;
					visiting the young Men in the different Societies, which I continued till 1748
					about w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> time I was obliged to engage so deeply in the Manufactory and
					other outward affairs that I declin&apos;d preaching, &amp; for sev<hi rend="superscript">l </hi>years together
					went thro&apos; a Scene of Distress in my own Mind with the External affairs
					in w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I was engagd, however I continued <hi rend="strikethrough">therein</hi> to assist therein, &amp; went
					several times to Holland on that Acc<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> &amp; bore a part in most of the Transac-
					tions till the year 1753, when Ruin seem&apos;d to threaten our whole Constitution,
					if our <hi rend="superscript">dr</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had not miraculously interpos&apos;d &amp;
						Inspird the d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Disciple
					w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Courage &amp; Generosity more than Human, whereby he was enabled to
					satisfy all the Creditors, being willing to take all the Debt upon himself
					w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> had been Contracted without his knowledge &amp; Consent. &apos;Tis true I endea-
					vour&apos;d to hinder his engaging himself for such vast Sums of Money
					w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> He had no visible fund to discharge withal, &amp; wo&apos;d rather have
					suffer&apos;d any hardships myself, than be the occasion of Involving his
					dr. Person, but he was Resolv&apos;d to do it &amp; did it I dout not af the
					Command of his Lord &amp; Master, who <hi rend="strikethrough">has</hi> indeed has miraculously
					help&apos;d him thro&apos; to the wonder &amp; astonishmt of all men both Friend
					&amp; Enemies, &amp; wch certainly among the Surprising Transactions of
					his Life in the Kingdon of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <add place="above">will</add> see transmilted down to the 
					latest posterity as an unparrelld act of <hi rend="strikethrough">his</hi> love &amp; faithfulness &amp;
					Generosity to his people. with the conclusion of these dangerous
					&amp; troublesome Affairs of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, I reckon I may also conclude
					one period of my Life w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> probably contains pretty near the whole
					of the mortal past &amp; when I look back how I have spent it and
					consider that I have been almost twice seven Years in the Kingdom
					of our <add place="above">dr</add> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, I really Blush &amp; my heart is asham&apos;d before my
					faithful Creator &amp; Redeemer, that I have been so little Joy to Him

					Him in this world, for all the Smart &amp; pain w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> He has sufferred on
					my acct, &amp; can only entreat Him that He wo<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> forgive the best
					actions of my Life, &amp; entirely obliterate the worst &amp; greatest part
					for when I Reflect upon the whole, my poor heart sincerely sighs
					<hi rend="underline">Kyrie Eleison</hi>!</p>
					<p>
					on his Birth Day Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1753. He wrote <add place="above">the</add> following
					My ever dearest Lamb, my only Saviour &amp; Redeemer, my Heart adores
					&amp; worships thee in thy Crucified <add place="above">&amp; Bleeding</add> form, and with a Sinnerlike heart
					implores thy Pardon &amp; absolution for every thing in my whole Life.
					but particularly for every thing in the year past, Thou know&apos;st o
					my God that it has been a year of Trial &amp; Temptations to thy
					People in general &amp; to my poor heart in particular, O forgive I pray
					thee my dearest Lamb! O forgive all my unfaithfulness, all my unbelief,
					all my disharmony towards my B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; let every thing that is past be
					Buried in thy wounds &amp; Rem<add place="above">em</add>bred no more, &amp; help thy People thro&apos;
					all Difficulties in w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> they are Involv&apos;d to the Honour of thy Name
					&amp; Gospel &amp; particularly, I entreat thee my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to bless &amp; preserve
					me in this my 33<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>year of my Life in wch I am now enter&apos;d, &amp; is the more
					important to me, as it in the dear of Life in w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> thou didst finish the 
					work of our Eternal Redemption, &amp; didst Seql my Salvation with thy
					most precious Blood; O let it be an ever Memorable year to my heart;
					O my Lamb let it be the year in w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> my whole Being shall be made
					like unto thee, &amp; wherein everything unlamblike shall be Interr&apos;d
					for ever, The year wherein I may Receive an everlarding Impression of
					thy whole Martyr&apos;d Body, that thy dear amiable wounded person may
					become the Object of all my wishes &amp; desires, &amp; if those shouldest permit
					me also to finish my course this Year, oh prepare my heart for the 
					enjoyment &amp; possession of thyself, &amp; Receive me as a poor Sinner into
					thy bleeding arms; or if thou wouldst have one stay still a little longer
					here, &amp; help me to act my part faithfully to the Honour &amp; to the Joy

					of thy People, &amp; so impregnate my Tabernacle w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> thy holy Hemanel
					That all the Sids of Corruption may the destroy&apos;d in me, &amp; help me thro&apos;

					The office w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he had in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> at Fulneck requiring
						that he
					sho have a Helpmate, He enter&apos;d Nov<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1754 into
						the M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> State with the
					S S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eleanora Gutbier his present Widow, to whom he had approv&apos;d himself
					a faithful tender Husband, &amp; they have liv&apos;d near 16 years together in
					Grace &amp; Blessing.</p>
					<p>
					 In the year 1755 when the place Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> was Settled, He was
					appointed to be the Vorsteher (or Warden) of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at the same time <add place="above">that</add> he
					had the direction of the Manufacture, &amp; in this Office He continued till
					it pleased our Lord to call him to his Eternal Rest.</p>
					<p>
					From the very beginning of the Settlement here, He was particularly
					engag&apos;d in every undertaking &amp; till the year 1763, all the external
					Affairs of this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> relating to the Settlement viz the Administration
					of the Estate &amp; Buildings, were in his Hands. In this Situation
					he had many difficulties to struggle with, &amp; felt often the Lord that
					was upon him with much concern. From the year 1755, he was
					not only employed in the External affairs, but He &amp; His dear wife
					assisted in the Internal Labour. <add place="above">In 1754 He was ordain&apos;d a</add>
					<add place="above">Deacon of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn&apos;s</hi> Church</add></p>
					<p>
					In June 1756, he with his wife went to the Synod at Berthelsdorf
					Tho&apos; he was chiefly to the Service of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi> in Yorkshire, yet he was
					also engag&apos;d in the Affairs of Ockbrook, Duckenfield, &amp; in sundry concerns
					of the Unity &amp; our Lord having bestow&apos;d upon him particular Gifts &amp; Grace
					to his Service, he remain&apos;d active in all those matters.</p>
					<p>
					In the Year 1757 he was appointed to be one of the Board of
					Administation of the Affairs of the Unity in England, &amp; was usefull
					therein, &amp; when the Oconomates Con<hi rend="superscript">fr</hi> was Settled, he was appointed

			<p>
					a member thereof &amp; continued as such till that Con<hi rend="superscript">fer</hi> ceas&apos;d in the 
					year 1769. Tho&apos; his Talents in the Conducting the external <add place="above">affairs</add> were
					known &amp; priz&apos;d by his B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; on that account He was constantly
					employ&apos;d in that way, yet he also wish&apos;d to be rather employ&apos;d in 
					the Internal Labour, &amp; often express&apos;d his desire to be freed from all
					his External engagements. In consequence of this his repeated
					Request, He was Released in 1763 from being immediately active
					in the Manufacture, tho&apos; he remain&apos;d the Counsellor in it till the
					year 1766; when it came into another Channel.</p>
					<p>
					Being Proprietor of the Estate, He frequently attended the Meetings
					of the Parish for conducting the Town&apos;s Busyness, &amp; by his prudent
					advice He gain&apos;d the esteem of the acting persons in the Parish &amp;
					was of Service in this point of view to the Settlement.</p>
					<p>
					He went as Deputy of this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> to the Gen Synods at Marienborn
					in 1764 &amp; last Year, &amp; returned from the last very infirm, tho&apos; his disorder
					w&apos;d not permit him to go much about, yet he assisted in the Labour
					in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; from this time, the publick Testimony of our Savr &amp; his
					Suffrings &amp; the Discourses w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he Deliver&apos;d to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; Choirs were
					particularly Anointed, &amp; being delivered with warmth of heart were
					attended with Blessing. So that some B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> made for thence the 
					Remark that they believed he wo<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not stay long in the Church below
					for he was preparing for the Church above. It was also observ&apos;d
					in his Discourses &amp; Conversation, the apprehensions He had of the 
					dangerouse principle of Free thinking &amp; acting w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> had erept in
					amongst us, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> might be more hurtful to our Constitution, than
					any other difficulty we were sensible of</p>
					<p>
					He had for many years past frequent Sicknesses, &amp; having a
					great portion of sensibility, when matters did not go well &amp; contrary
					to his hopes, his Body felt the effects thereof. He was of a
					thinking disposition, &amp; when he was shut up in himself, his

			<p>
					inward Grief prey&apos;d upon him, of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he was sensible &amp; wo<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>speak
					of at times with concern. All this seem&apos;d to impair his Body &amp;
					<hi rend="strikethrough">of the after land carnal which </hi> He often said &amp; wrote that his chief
					Busyness &amp; concern was now to he prepar&apos;d to leave this Body, &amp;
					to enter into the presence of his Lord.</p>
					<p>
					Last spring He had a very severe attack of the stone Cholick
					of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> He Recovr&apos;d so as to be active in his Office, yet the Effects
					were Visible. He had a second fitt of sickness with an Inflamation
					in his Face &amp; a violent pain in his Head by w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he was confin&apos;d
					to his Room ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> a fortnight, but was again so well Recover&apos;d
					as to go about, but his Constitution was apparently weaken&apos;d w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>
					rais&apos;d the apprehensions of his going home of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he spoke frequent-
					ly with desire. He preached on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to a very large Auditory
					with Life &amp; Energy, of the efficacious power in Jesus&apos; Blood &amp;
					Death to make us New Creatures, and his last meeting kept in
					the Hall was a Discourse to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> for the
						Conclusion
					of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Day on the W. W<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>&quot;Shew forth his
						Salvation from Day
					to Day.&quot; which he eamestly Recomended to the Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> to put
					in practice in Life &amp; Conversation,&amp; entreated our D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lord, kneeling
					to happily effect it with each &amp; the whole; this has prov&apos;d his
					Valedictory discourse &amp; prayer for this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; the work of the 
					Lord in general. He soon after had a Boil w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> gathered on his
					Shoulder &amp; was attended with much pain &amp; inflam&apos;d his Back
					w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> threw him into a Bilious Fever. Even during his sickness
					he shew&apos;d his wonted paternal heart in Counsel &amp; Friedship to
					those who came to him, as long as he had strength to speak.
					He was tender &amp; loving to all, saying once &quot;I have nothing against
					any one &amp; hope no one has any thing against me.

					we were still in hopes that by the discharge of the Abcess in
					his Back (w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> was pretty large) his Constitution might have been
					Reliev&apos;d &amp; he Restor&apos;d to Health, but on the 29th ab<hi rend="superscript">t </hi> 2 in the Morning
					we observ&apos;d an Alteration &amp; that the weight of his disorder was
					fallen upon his Lungs, then it became evident that our gracious
					Lord intended to take him soon into his Joy, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he himself expect-
					ed wo<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be accomplished by the sametime real moving, amidst
					his pain &amp; weakness. He spent his time in such a tender loving
					&amp; Paternal manner towards all &amp; especially towards his dear
					wife &amp; Niece, &amp; those by orphans to whom he had been Guardian,
					&amp; in looking ardently to his faithful Lord in expectation of the
					happy Moments quick approach; that it was truly edifying
					to all who came near him.</p>
					<p>
					After 12 o Clock in the Night he ask&apos;d what were the Texts
					for the Day, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> being Read as follows, the W: W<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. &quot;My
						Soul
					breaketh for longing that it hath unto thy Judgments at all

					Cheek bedew&apos;d with Million Tears forth thronging from th&apos; 
					enamour&apos;d Churches Face? And the Text,. &quot;Righteousness
					shall be the Girdle of his Loins &amp; faithfulness the Girdle
					of his Reins.&quot; With the whole merit of thy Life, Bless
					us O d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lord &amp; god;&quot; of which He took great notice, saying,
					how comfortable &amp; pretty they were, believing confidently
					the time drew near when Faith sho<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be turn&apos;d into Vision.
					when the Clock struck two, he seem&apos;d something disappointed that he
					was yet here, &amp; when another hour was elapesd, He look&apos;d up in 
					an earnest manner, &amp; expressed in his great weakness &amp; pain

					his Desire to his d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lord, to take him to himself complaining
					that this hour had been very long. Thus he continued looking
