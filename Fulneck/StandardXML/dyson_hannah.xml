					<l>Hanna Dyson</l>
					<l />
					<l>I was born at Kerkstill in the parish of Kerkhetten in the Year 1728 My Father was a</l>
					<l>Clothmaker In my young Years my parents sent me to School Till I was so</l>
					<l>old that I could do some service at home I was of a very brisk &amp; Lively turn of mind</l>
					<l>And I perceived often that if God did not preserve me I should run into uter ruing as I felt</l>
					<l>My basness &amp; inclination there to stir very much in me my Father &amp; Mother was always</l>
					<l>for there Children going to <del>school</del> Church very Constant &amp; I got a great Liking thereto</l>
					<l>As I alwas lik'd to here what I could there &amp; when ever I went to Church I uste to pray</l>
					<l>the Lord to bless me very earnestly &amp; to bestow great blessing on me I uste to be very</l>
					<l>Much Consernd but did not then understand ye meaning thereof One time being in</l>
					<l>Very great Distress I went out in the Barn to pray &amp; as I pray'd I wisht to God</l>
					<l>that he would answer me my prayer and preserve &amp; keep me to the end of my days</l>
					<l>and make me his faithfull Servent but in a perticular Manner I pray'd that he would</l>
					<l>Give me his grace at that time, which might endure throought all the Days of</l>
					<l>My Life One Night I Drempt that we had Company &amp; I going to attend</l>
					<l>on them on a Low flower I ment to men the One <del>was</del> was Drest in dark Collor</l>
					<l>and the Other in a Long read Robe <add place="above">he that was in black</add>
						<del>One</del> ask'd me wether <del>of them I should chose</del></l>
					<l>I was agoing I told him about my busyness he then ask'd me wich of them</l>
					<l>too I shoud chose, I then arnesty Looked on them both but did not directly give</l>
					<l>it Answer he said wether did I chose Heaven &amp; Hell I said one always chose</l>

				<lg>
					<l>Heaven you know he ask'd me again which of us then do you chuse I answerd</l>
					<l>him hastily not you, but this and standing nearest him in the Red Robe</l>
					<l>I got hold on him he then smiled at me &amp; bowed his Head I also moved to</l>
					<l>him and got hold of the robe and wanted to look what was under it he then</l>
					<l>smiled again and bow'd his Head &amp; said not yet I then was very much ashamed</l>
					<l>that I made so free with him, but he held out his hand &amp; Smiled I then Looking</l>
					<l>down to the Ground lost sight of them both and so I awaked with a deep Soncern</l>
					<l>On my mind just then about there was a great talk about some prechers</l>
					<l>that sung hymns &amp; pray'd &amp; precht in Barns and particularly Mis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ingam who was</l>
					<l>just then come out of Jorde they called him a new found pretcher and so my Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi></l>
					<l>And me whent one Night to here <add place="above">him</add> But he mist that Night coming where he</l>
					<l>should have precht &amp; so we must here him On my rode I went with some Body</l>
					<l>who lent me a little hymn Book I Learnt some verses there by which I uste</l>
					<l>frequently to sing soon after this my Mother fell sick &amp; whent in to a Consomtion</l>
					<l>And dyd I then thought I had Lost one of my best friends I could have but being</l>
					<l>then left with my Father &amp; Grandmother she was very good to me &amp; kept me</l>
					<l>very close to my Book especialy asundays so that I might get amoungst</l>
					<l>no saught of lose Company, soon after my Mother Departer my Father also</l>
					<l>who was really a good &amp; tender father over his Children</l>
					<l>Dyd I then whent to service being in my 13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> Year I then begun to get more into</l>
					<l>things belong to the would which sated my inclination but as I had been brought up in another</l>
					<l>way I was not always satisfied there with becaus I did not <add place="above">know</add> there ways rightly <del>My</del></l>

					<l>At one place where I was I fell sick &amp; got the ague where I was obliged to live</l>
					<l>My place I had about a duzen or 14 Mile to go back to my native place</l>
					<l>And over Larg Commons to some where my master brought me alone back to the</l>
					<l>Last Common to so biding Farewell to him I sat me down &amp; began to weep heartily</l>
					<l>Being exceeding Burdend with my Cloths &amp; so weak that I scarsely say any means of</l>
					<l>getting to my Unkle where I was agowing &amp; have no right home to go to made</l>
					<l>it very heard to me But I prayd to God that he would help &amp; direct me how</l>
					<l>to go on I wept in a perticular manner thinking that with not praying sickness</l>
					<l>had come upon me Now I was not Long destant for ahome as my Ant</l>
					<l>in a few Days sent for me &amp; said I should stay as Long as my sickness</l>
					<l>Lasted which was a great while but she behaved as a tender mother over me</l>
					<l>I then being quit recoverd <del>I</del> went to Harchet to see my Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> And soon after</l>
					<l>then I wen to here Mis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ingam at Fox rode at Mirfeild he preached on 63<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> Chap<hi rend="superscript:true;"
							>r</hi></l>
					<l>O Ezah who is this that cometh from edom with dyd Garmants for Bozrah this that</l>
					<l>is Glorous in his aperel Traveling in the Greatness of his strength</l>
					<l>I was very much tuched at <add place="above">this</add> and though I never heard such preaching in my Life</l>
					<l>Soon after I begin to here the Bretheren &amp; I was exceeding miserable thinking that all</l>
					<l>Preching &amp; praying prevailed nothing on me but that I should be Lost &amp; mend</l>
					<l>forever One Night I was exceedngly overcome with terror &amp; fright thinking</l>
					<l>that I should go to hell &amp; so should never be saved But in a little while I begun to grow</l>
					<l>eager &amp; so being by my self at my busyness all at once I was exceeding seazed upon for</l>
					<l>Our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> at that time manifested him self before my Heart and I say as</l>
					<l>Clearly as if I had seen him Crucifyed before my eyes that Left such an imprestion</l>
					<l>upon me that I was obliged to set down and I was quiet surprised what was</l>
					<l>come to me <del>but</del>
						<add place="above">and</add> as miserable as I was before so happy was that after for <del>I believed</del></l>
					<l>was, so that they perceived my chearfullness was well so my pease was</l>
					<l>I <del>had</del> was often spoken with &amp; told that both going to hear ther prechers I was</l>
					<l>growne quite molencolly and <del>again</del> after a little while I begun to grow miserable</l>
					<l>again, but I gladly would have overcome it with like mindedness and things belonging</l>
					<l>to this world thinking there by to have Satisfaction &amp; strove against it as much</l>
					<l>as lade in my power. one Sunday as I whent to Church (and always going to ran ahead)</l>
					<l>I though I would miss &amp; so going home I got to my Companons as soon as possible</l>
					<l>and while we where to gether the Master of the house cameing &amp; we whent but but he</l>
					<l>said as long as we was so altogether (and me amongst them) there would never be no</l>
					<l>good done which struck me so when I heard him that I left my Companions</l>
					<l>I made a resolution to mis the pritching no more and so but of &amp; when <del>but to</del> rawhead</l>
					<l>but the preaching was half over then after a little while I begun to think that I</l>
					<l>could like to belong to the society accordingly I whent to Bro<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ockerhousen</l>
					<l>and told them my mind &amp; Intention they askued me if I had quite Lost my</l>
					<l>inclination for the things of this world &amp; how a soul should be that was a</l>
					<l>County member how was they gave me Leave to go to the county she next</l>
					<l>time so as soon as my Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> perceived that I would belong to the Bretheren</l>

				<lg>
					<l>She begun to think that I was better then her which caused a great dissagrement</l>
					<l>betwen us Brother &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ockerhousen got ordered me to go to Kane Wartons</l>
					<l>where I sayed near too year &amp; from thence I removed to Cleckheaton to Live</l>
					<l>with Sarah rite &amp; her Mother being engaged some where else &amp; <del>there I stayed</del></l>
					<l>from thence I removed in the Oeconomy when it begun at Clekheaton</l>
					<l>the same year the 22<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> of May <del>the same Y</del> I was received into the Congregation</l>
					<l>soon after I began to think very much about the Lordsupper &amp; the Year</l>
					<l>following I became a Candidate in May when Broth Johanas &amp; Benigna</l>
					<l>was here &amp; on the 10<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> of July I had the Grace to be a pertaker for the first time</l>
					<l>Which in deed was every particular Grace &amp; Bless for my poor heart &amp; found</l>
					<l>it was a real food for my soul here I found my dear Saviour Begun a</l>
					<l>new school with me the Next Year after I removed from Cleckheaton</l>
					<l>to the home Oeconomy where I stayed about a Year &amp; then I removed</l>
					<l>to the Low house to that Oeconomy &amp; from thence to the Toop of the Hill</l>
					<l>Hear it was quite a new beganing to me &amp; found it often very</l>
					<l>needfull to beg our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> for Grace to help me thro' with soon after I removed</l>
					<l>To the hall to weight on the Bretheren &amp; Sister where I served about 2 Years</l>
					<l>??? true I look on this as a great favour I found it was great</l>
					<l>Blessing to me to be amongst the Brethren &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> &amp; to serve</l>
					<l>them next I removed in to the Choir House but here I found it difficulter</l>
					<l>then ever I often pray'd to my Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to help me thro' with every thing</l>
					<l>after awhile I midst the Lords supper on the account of which I did find</l>
					<l>it still hard to be a sinner But I pray'd Our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> that he would for give</l>
					<l>Me and take me again as his poor Sinner which he really did in</l>
					<l>Our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> gave me Leave to enjoy that highest good the next time</l>
					<l>The tim after I mist again but I had leave to go the time following</l>
					<l>Now soon after this <add place="above">the</add> a place Congregation was settled which was put very</l>
					<l>Close to us and was told us what would be required of every</l>
					<l>Broth &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
						<add place="above">belonging in</add>
						<del>must do</del> a place Congregation this was a perticular matter to me</l>
					<l>and especialy as times was very Critical with me I could not just resolve what</l>
					<l>to do firs we had it told by Bro<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Johanas in the Great Hall when</l>
					<l>was realy a Strikeing matter to me after wards in our owne meeting</l>
					<l>Hall at firs it put me a little to it but soon I saw there was no way but</l>
					<l>to give my self intirely to our Saviour to be his &amp; what he pleas'd to do</l>
					<l>with me &amp; that day I never forgot <del>it</del> soon after this I mist the Lordssupper</l>
					<l>again then I begun to reason very much &amp; wounderd what was the matter</l>
					<l>that things whent so heard I when by myself into the Burying Ground </l>
					<l>and prayd our Saviour that he would make it Clear to me if it was my</l>
					<l>right place to be here or no for I realy was quite far &amp; I did not</l>
					<l>know what to think &amp; if he had some other view with me he would</l>
					<l>make me satisfyd that have ever I might have some Satisfaction. </l>
					<l>my Life some times I prayed our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> that if he had some other</l>
					<l>view with me that he would bless my heart &amp; give me a Grace which</l>
					<l>I felt he very often did</l>

			<p>
				<l>Now I begun to think wether I had done right or not with asking our Sav</l>
				<l>so far but soon after I became quite Satisfyed &amp; I was clear in my Heart</l>
				<l>our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> was Satisfyed tho' things whent on but poorly soon after it was</l>
				<l>told me Conserning going to the Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> hous at Beedforde I had not the</l>
				<l>Least objections to make on this account but I found it so in my</l>
				<l>Heart that if our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; his Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> ordered it so with me I was</l>
				<l>quite Satisfyd tho' I cant say but it caused me a deal of pain</l>
				<l>to leave this dear place Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> where I had so sensible felt my</l>
				<l>dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> nearness. We set out on ye 18<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> of June in the year 60 with</l>
				<l>the Blessing of the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> &amp; on the 24<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> we arrived in Bedford in the</l>
				<l>Sisrs House here Our Savr begun <del>quite a new school with our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi></del>
					<add place="above">began quite a new school with me</add> &amp; I felt</l>
				<l>I stood in need of his nearness in a prticular manner &amp; I often keep band</l>
				<l>with my dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to Comfort me for I felt the want of this dear place</l>
				<l>Congregation so much that sometimes I could not be satisfy'd but after</l>
				<l>awhile I begun to be better Satisfyed for I believed it was the place for me</l>
				<l>[Illegible]</l>
				<l>[Illegible]</l>
				<l>[Illegible]</l>
				<l>[Illegible]</l>
				<l>[Illegible]</l>
				<l>After awhile here [Illegible]</l>
				<l>[Illegible]</l>
				<l>Then I begun to think that if I could live the Bretheren I should have</l>
				<l>nothing against if But as our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> who always steeped before my</l>
				<l>Heart Comforted me at that time also not long after it was told me</l>
				<l>I should come again to fullneck which I received with a glad heart</l>
				<l>and when I got to my dear Choir hous again I beged our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to</l>
				<l>grant me bouth the Old &amp; new feeling which I can truly say he has now</l>
				<l>But I haveing a very sickly Tabernickel since the time of my comeing</l>
				<l>it has often caused me perplexity on account of my Comeing thro'</l>
				<l>???? at my turn the General Synod being &amp; here what our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> had to say</l>
				<l>to the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> it affected me very much I thought I must take a great</l>
				<l>part there in I often uste to go out &amp; beg our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to make a new begin with me</l>
				<l>And he did frequently steep before my Heart &amp; Comfort me. In Ocktob<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi></l>
				<l>I feel sick so that I thought <del>that</del> our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> would take me to himself but how</l>
				<l>ever it did not happen at that time Our Savr has had a perticular schooling with</l>
				<l><del>Savr</del> me which in the end has proved perticularly blesst to me this year has been</l>
				<l>a very sickly one with me so that I often felt my self very weakly which has</l>
				<l>made me think often Our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> perhaps intended to take me to himself &amp; I do</l>
				<l>Injoy his nearness in a perticular manner</l>
