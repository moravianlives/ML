                  that time I knew nothing of our <persName type="diety">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persName>, neither did I think of any religion, so I went on without tho<hi

                  no never while I live, will I go to hear them naughty people, then my parents tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> come into something bad, because I
                  seem'd so wild, but for all that, I had no liking to that w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> my companions follow'd, but always felt an aversion against it in my heart, at that time, I
                  did not know how it sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be so, but now I <note type="catchword">know</note></p>

               <p>know that it was my dear <persName type="diety">Lord</persName> that kept me, from all hurt &amp; shame. In my <date when-iso="1748" cert="medium">17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                     Year</date> my Master had the misfortune to be kill'd, this struck one very much, but that went oft again without thinking any further, but that he was at rest; In my <date
                     when-iso="1749" cert="medium">18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year</date> I had a dream w<hi rend="superscript">ch </hi> made such an impression on my heart, that I never forgot,
                  my parents were afraid that something had happen'd to me, my Mother ask'd me if my mistress had been hard with me. I answer'd no, it was something that I had dream'd, then my Father
                  came to me, &amp; said, come now tell me what it is, but my heart was quite full, however I told it; &amp; it was, I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> a man came to me, drest in a
                  white surples, stood over me, &amp; look'd very solid at me, then he spread his hands over me, &amp; then folded them upon his breast, &amp; I <del>not</del> knowing that I was in
                  Bed, tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I <add place="above">will</add> lye quite still &amp; see what <note type="catchword">he</note></p>

               <p>he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> do to me, then he smil'd at me, &amp; began to write with his finger upon my forehead, for a good while, then he laid his hand upon my head with
                  such a powerfull feeling that tears flow'd without number, then he look'd again at me and smil'd &amp; turn'd away &amp; left me, then I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I will fetch
                  a looking glass to see what was done on my forehead, but I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> if he has wrote, I cant read writing, however I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> look &amp;
                  when I saw there was written in large leders in crimson &amp; I cou'd read it, &amp; it was; - I will take care of the, thou shalt not be lost, &amp; when I awoke my pillow was quite
                  wet with tears, &amp; I wept almost the whole Night &amp; c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not help it, for the impression remains to this day, &amp; will remain till I go to kiss
                  those hands, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> was held over me, then I began to think that my time was <add place="above">not</add> end for then I had almost 2 Years to stay, w<hi

               <p>indeed seem'd to me very long, but I began to think I will forget this feeling, &amp; be as I was before, but I cou'd not, for it always came to me again, once I went to my Father
                  &amp; privately took their H. Book, &amp; bro<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> it away with me, for I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> see what my Sis<hi
                     rend="superscript">rs</hi> sung out of that book, for they often sung when I was there, &amp; when my Mistress &amp; all were in Bed, I read in it, &amp; that verse: Yea wounds of
                  Jesus bless me now; that verse soon took my mind, for I began to think who is that Jesus w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> has wounds, I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I know no
                  meaning of this, however I re<add place="above">a</add>d it over &amp; over &amp; the sametime tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>, as soon as my time is out, I will go to hear those
                  people, that I have despis'd so much, perhaps they will tell me more of that Jesus; so I did, when my time was out, I went with my parents, to hear the B<hi rend="superscript"
                     >rn</hi> to my great joy for the first time, I heard them, they told of that Jesus, full of wounds w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> was made for poor sinners, this struck me deeply
                     <note type="catchword">then</note></p>

               <p>then I was soon taken into the society, I went on &amp; felt our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> near my heart &amp; was so happy that I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I wanted
                  nothing more, in his way I went on for near 7 Years, then I began to think of being rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, &amp; spoke about it,
                  it happen'd that some were re<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
                  <del>before one</del> out of my class, &amp; I was left, then I was griev'd &amp; tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> they chose the worst, &amp; leave the best, for I tho<hi
                     rend="superscript">t</hi> they chose the worst, &amp; have the best, for I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> myself the fittest, I therefore went away perplext indeed, but it did
                  not remain long, for my dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> soon shew'd me, that I was the worst of all, &amp; my happiness was nothing; then I felt quite miserable &amp; tho<hi
                     rend="superscript">t</hi> it is no wonder, that I am unreceived for I am not fit for the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, nor any thing else, I thot I had griev'd our Sav<hi
                     rend="superscript">r</hi> so much, that I dare not ask him to forgive me, in this situation I went on for almost a week, &amp; on Sunday I went to <note type="catchword"

               <p>hear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> LaTrobe preach, he began with inviting all those that were the most sinfull of all, &amp; said that our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> stood
                  ready to forgive every one that w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> come to him, even just as you are; O then I tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I will go to him &amp; try whether he can
                  forgive me, I therefore threw myself at the thro pierced feet of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, &amp; said to him dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> here is one of the
                  poorest of all thy flock, canst thou forgive me. The feeling w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> over power'd me, at that hour, my poor tongue is not able to express; it was as if our
                     Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> said to me, I forgive thee all thy sins, yes I forgive thee ev'ry thing &amp; own thee as one of my little Flock. </p>
