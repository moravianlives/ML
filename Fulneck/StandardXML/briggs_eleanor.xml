            <p>
            <lb/>Memoir of the Single S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Eleanor Briggs
            <lb/>I was born at Pudsey in the Parish of Calverly, County of York, Oct<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 20<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1752, and
            <lb/>Baptized by a Presbyterian Minister, my Parents being of that persuasion, but soon after
            <lb/>join'd the Methodists, who having at that time no Chapel in Pudsey they held their meetings in
            <lb/>my Fathers house. the Minister who came at different times to preach, often prayed the Lord
            <lb/>to bless us Children, the names of M<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Whitfield, Westley, Grimshaw, Eastwood, and many others
            <lb/>I remember particularly, and have often in the sequel thought their blessing has rested upon
            <lb/>us. When I was five years old it pleas'd the Lord to take my Father to himself, after a tedious
            <lb/>illness of two years, which brought my Mother into very distressing in circumstances, a few
            <lb/>days before his departure, he desir'd that Mother with five Children might be call'd to his
            <lb/>Bedside, that he might commend us in prayer to the Lord, and give us his last blessing,
            <lb/>he assur'd my Mother the Lord wou'd care for her and us too, if she wou'd only put her trust
            <lb/>in him it was a moving sight five helpless Children, with a Mother almost drown'd in tears
            <lb/>and ready to faint with trouble, happily for her she knew in whom she believed and trusted
            <lb/>in him with her whole heart, and amidst all her trouble who had faith that the Lord would
            <lb/>never leave, nor forsake her, and she was not put to shame. In my sixth year I happened
            <lb/>to be where one of the Methodists was preaching which terrified me so much that for some
            <lb/>days after I could do nothing but cry, his discourse was upon the state of the wicked after
            <lb/>death, I thought I was one of those wicked people, and must go to hell, I told my Mother
            <lb/>my distress, she bid me pray to God to have mercy upon me, I did this, as well as I could
            <lb/>but thought I was so bad he would not grant my prayer, I beg'd her to pray for me that
            <lb/>I might not be lost, she assur'd me she did, and she was sure I shou'd be saved if I was a
            <lb/>good Child, however this did not satisfy me, an Uncle of mine who lived near Fulneck came
            <lb/>often to our house, he was one of the Brethren, I thought the next time I saw him I would
            <lb/>tell him my distress, I was anxious to see him and know what he would say to me
            <lb/>that I went into a Wood he had to pass thro to meet him, he took me up in his arms
            <lb/>telling me that God Almighty whom I was so much afraid of came into the world too
            <lb/>as a little Child, and lived a life of suffering upwards of thirty years on purpose
            <lb/>to save sinners from being lost, this made a deep impression upon me, which I never lost
            <lb/>tho' I have since run astray in various ways, yet my gracious Savior kept his
            <lb/>hand over me. A Gentleman in the town who took delight in visiting the poor and
            <lb/>doing good came often to see my mother, and was a great comfort to her, she put me to
            <lb/>school, and said when I was big enough she would take me into her own family, but
            <lb/>it pleas'd the Lord to order it otherwise, my Mother being unable to provide for five
            <lb/>Children was oblig'd to apply to the overseer for relief, he propos'd placing the two
            <lb/>oldest Girls out aprentice, this caus'd her great trouble, knowing that many were
            <lb/>placed in families, where neither their souls nor bodies were cared for, she pray'd
            <lb/>fervently to the Lord himself to make a way for us, and in answer to her prayer a
            <lb/>friend of hers came in as overseer, to him she told her trouble, he gave her the choice
            <lb/>of three places, the one she fix'd on for me was the Rev<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> M<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Charlesworth of
            <lb/>Fulneck, I being the younger, he was surpriz'd that she chose that for me, and altho
            <lb/>reason, at that time she knew nothing of the Brethren, and cou'd only give 
            <lb/>reason that it was impress'd on her mind, it was the place for me, the [original damaged]
            <lb/>provided my way and brought me to his chosen people, where thro' his grace [original damaged]
            <lb/>remain'd, his all powerful hand has in mercy been held over me, and [original damaged]
            <lb/>to keep my ground even to this day, when I am completing my sixtieth [original damaged]
            <lb/>committed to the care of the Rev<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> M<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Charlesworth, and bound a [original damaged]
            <lb/>Mother entreated him not to let me be turn'd off the place when my time was [original damaged]
            <lb/>her with Fatherly kindness, and assur'd her I should not if I conduct [original damaged]
            <lb/>ought, the time was now come when my Mother &amp; I must part, after [original damaged]
            <lb/>on both sides, she pray'd the Lord to bless me, and bed me farewell [original damaged]
            <lb/>among entire strangers, my much respected Master &amp; Mistress [original damaged]
            <lb/>Fatherless Child only eight years old, with the utmost tender 
            <lb/>will be rewarded by Him who takes notice of the smallest kind
            <lb/>Children, especially to the friendless, I was put to a school kept
            <lb/>I had an opportunity of learning many verses concerning our Savi
            <lb/>deep impression upon me, our school M<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> was not able to teach us
            </p>
            <pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_107_Briggs_Eleanor-02.jpg" n="2"/>
            <p>
            <lb/>of work but she never failed to tell as much of our Savior, she one day took us into the
            <lb/>S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> sleeproom, as soon at the door open'd, the thought struck me, O that I might one day
            <lb/>live in this house, and while my companions were looking about them, I crept unobserv'd
            <lb/>between the Beds and prostrated myself in prayer to my Savior to grant me this favor
            <lb/>and simple as it was the Lord did not disdain to hear me, for soon after any dear
            <lb/>Master was appointed to the office of Minister &amp; Warden of the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> and having
            <lb/>only room for themselves, and another for their servant they cou'd not take me,
            <lb/>now come on the trial what was to become of me? at that time no Children
            <lb/>were permitted to live on the place whose Parents did not belong, therefore my stay
            <lb/>was much opposed, but my good Master feeling bound by his promise to my Mother
            <lb/>beg'd it might be submitted to a director from the Lord, leave was granted not only
            <lb/>to remain in Fulneck but also to live in the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> House; previous to this B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Charlesworth
            <lb/>had obtain'd the promise of the Choir helper of the Single S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>, Sr Mary Voagleson
            <lb/>to take me in promising on his part that I should not be troublesome to the family
            <lb/>with regard to my living, she took me into her special care, and treated me with
            <lb/>the tenderness of Mother, her memory while be ever dear to me a helpless orphan
            <lb/>I trust the Lord has rewarded her in this world, and that she is now receiving the
            <lb/>crowning reward in heaven, it was a severe trial to me when this dear person
            <lb/>was call'd to Gracehill as Choir helper of the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> there, but the Lord in whom I trusted did
            <lb/>not forsake me. I was rec<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> into the Conng<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> in the year 1767. which proved a great
            <lb/>blessing to me, and I went on for some time happy and chearful, but subsequently fell
            <lb/>into a careless indifferent state, yet strong convictions that I was wrong follow'd me,
            <lb/>good advice was not wanting, but foolishly disregarded, till it pleas'd the Lord to visit me
            <lb/>with a fit of sickness which brought me so low that I was on the brink of the grave, when
            <lb/>I was inform'd that the Doctor had given me up, I said I shou'd soon be gone, it gave
            <lb/>me a shock no words can describe, the fear &amp; hate must be lost for ever drove me in
            <lb/>earnest prayer to the Lord to raise me from that bed of sickness, and not to permit
            <lb/>me to be launched into eternity unprepared, it pleas'd him in mercy to grant my request
            <lb/>and I made many promises to him to begin again anew, but alas they were soon
            <lb/>forgot when I got well, and I went on as before, till the Lord in mercy to his
            <lb/>rebellious creature visited me with another severe attack of sickness, it struck me with
            <lb/>such a deep sense of my sinful state, that I fell on my face at his feet imploring his
            <lb/>patience and forgiveness, and from that time I determind to follow the Lord thro'
            <lb/>all whether hard or easy might be my lot thro' life. In Oct<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 1776 I had the favor
            <lb/>to be spectator at the Holy Com<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> and July the 19<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1777 to partake of that high
            <lb/>est good I shall never forget that enjoyment, I had many difficulties to encounter
            <lb/>in outward circumstances, apparently often impossible to be overcome but the
            <lb/>help of my Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> brought me thru, and about this time I was appointed to teach
            <lb/>in the Children's school in Pudsey plan, for some time it was in a very prosperous
            <lb/>state, during the summer as many as Sixty in number and some pleasing proofs
            <lb/>of our Saviors blessing became manifested at the departure of many of these dear
            <lb/>young Children, from here I was call'd into the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> house to have the care
            <lb/>[original damaged] the wash, this situation I found one of peculiar difficulties, but here also
            <lb/>[original damaged] oved the Lords help was sufficient to support me, now I will look
            <lb/>[original damaged] on the way the Lord hath led me to humble and prove me, and know
            <lb/>[original damaged] was in my heart, to see how kindly he has led me on thro' at times it seem'd
            <lb/>[original damaged] I had many hard struggles before I could bring myself to lie as
            <lb/>[original damaged] the feet of my Savior, but one day when in the deepest distress I took the
            <lb/>[original damaged] book and open'd the words for myself, the Lord thy God turned the cause into
            <lb/>[original damaged] because the Lord thy God loved thee, it came with such power to
            <lb/>[original damaged] as if spoken to <hi rend="underlined:true;">me</hi>, and impossible it seem'd I have liv'd to see its
            <lb/>[original damaged] which constrains me to say is anything too hard for the Lord! After this
            <lb/>[original damaged] was pleas'd to make a way for place of rest to me, by enabling me to procure
            <lb/>[original damaged] a little dwelling of my own, the happy days I spent there can never be
            <lb/>[original damaged] how often have I come from the Chapel and prostrated myself before my Savior
            <lb/>[original damaged] ever ends, his gracious visitations there constrain me to say with favor'd ???
            <lb/>[original damaged] that is present here. Fulneck, O Fulneck much belov'd Fulneck which gave
            <lb/>[original damaged] prov'd, how often hast thou witness'd my prayers and then offerd up forgiveness
            <lb/>[original damaged] distress, every spot in thee is hallowed ground thro'
            </p>
            <pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_107_Briggs_Eleanor-03.jpg" n="3"/>
            <p>
            <lb/>hundreds who have been train'd up in thee, and brought to the knowledge of a Savior
            <lb/>in that dear place, O that the Lord may in future cause his face to shine upon it, to the
            <lb/>end of days, that thousands yet unborn may be converted, and become witnesses of his
            <lb/>salvation together with hundreds in my time who in that blessd place found grace
            <lb/>and who will join me in an endless eternity to sing his praises for bringing us
            <lb/>thither, I desire especially dear Savior to give the unfeigned thanks for raising
            <lb/>me up a friend who for fifty years has remained such, thro' all painful and trying
            <lb/>circumstances, and now when I am old, and unable to help myself is willing to
            <lb/>assist and care for me, I thank thee for giving her grace and patience to bear with my
            <lb/>infirmities with unexampled tenderness, merciful Lord be pleas'd to reward her for all
            <lb/>her kind services, thou hast promised that a cup of cold water given in thy name
            <lb/>to any of thy Children shall receive its reward, and I feel assured thou hast seen her
