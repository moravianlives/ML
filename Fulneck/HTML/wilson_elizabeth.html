      <h2>Elizabeth Wilson</h2>
      <h2>1</h2>
      <p> Eliz: Willson. I was born in Yorkshire in in the parish of Leeds in Feb<sup>ry</sup> 21<sup>st</sup> 1731. baptized in the Church of England.
         						I was educated by my parents till I was 13 Years of age, then I was put apprentice
         for 6 Years, w<sup>ch</sup> I serv'd faithfully, tho' not without
         						hardships, but I being of a lightsome Turn of mind I got thro' better. for at
         that time I knew nothing of our Sav<sup>r</sup>, neither did I think of any
         						religion, so I went on without tho<sup>t</sup>, sometimes my Father wou'd ask me, come wilt thou go with us to hear the preaching
         to day, at w<sup>ch</sup> I was griev'd, &amp; said no never while I live, will I go to hear them naughty people,
         then my parents tho<sup>t</sup> I
         							sh<sup>d</sup> come into something bad, because I seem'd so wild, but for all that, I had no liking
         to that w<sup>ch</sup> my
         						companions follow'd, but always felt an aversion against it in my heart, at
         that time, I did not know how it sh<sup>d</sup> be so, but now I </p>
      <h2>2</h2>
      <p> know that it was my dear Lord that kept me, from all hurt &amp; shame. In my 17<sup>th</sup> Year my Master had the misfortune to be kill'd, this struck
         						me very much, but that went oft again without thinking any further, but that
         he was at rest; In my 18<sup>th</sup> Year I had a dream w<sup>ch</sup> made such an impression on my heart, that I never forgot, my parents were afraid
         that something had happen'd to me, my Mother ask'd me if my mistress had
         						been hard with me, I answer'd no, it was something that I had dream'd, then
         my Father came to me, &amp; said, come now tell me what it is, but my heart was quite
         						full, however I told it, &amp; it was, I tho<sup>t</sup> a man came to me, drest in a white surples, stood over me, &amp; look'd very solid at
         me, then he
         						spread his hands over me, &amp; then folded them upon his breast, &amp; I not knowing that I was in Bed, thot I <sup>will</sup> lye
         						quite still &amp; see what </p>
      <h2>3</h2>
      <p> he w<sup>d</sup> do to me, then he smil'd at me, &amp; began to write with his finger upon my forehead,
         for a good while, then he laid his hand upon my
         						head with such a powerfull feeling that tears flow'd without number, then he
         look'd again at me and smil'd &amp; turn'd away &amp; left me, then I tho<sup>t</sup> I will fetch a looking glass to see what was done on my forehead, but I tho<sup>t</sup> if he has wrote, I cant read writing,
         						however I w<sup>d</sup> look &amp; when I saw there was written in large leders in crimson &amp; I cou'd read it,
         &amp; it was; I will take care of the,
         						thou shalt not be lost, &amp; when I awoke my pillow was quite wet with tears, &amp;
         I wept almost the whole Night &amp; c<sup>d</sup> not help it, for the
         						impression remains to this day, &amp; will remain till I go to kiss those hands,
         w<sup>ch</sup> was held over me, then I began to think that my time was <sup>not</sup> out for then I had almost 2 Years to stay, w<sup>ch</sup> indeed </p>
      <h2>4</h2>
      <p> indeed seem'd to me very long, but I began to think I will forget this feeling, &amp;
         be as I was before, but I cou'd not, for it always came to me again, once I went
         						to my Father &amp; privately took their H. Book, &amp; bro<sup>t</sup> it away with me, for I tho<sup>t</sup> I w<sup>d</sup>
         						see what my Sis<sup>rs</sup> sung out of that book, for they often sung when I was there, &amp; when my Mistress &amp;
         all were in Bed, I read in it, &amp;
         						that verse: Yea wounds of Jesus bless me now; that verse soon took my mind,
         for I began to think who is that Jesus w<sup>ch</sup> has wounds, I tho<sup>t</sup> I know no meaning of this, however I read it over &amp; over &amp; the sametime tho<sup>t</sup>, as soon as my time is out, I
         						will go to hear those people, that I have despis'd so much, perhaps they will
         tell me more of that Jesus; so I did, when my time was out, I went with my parents,
         to hear
         						the B<sup>rn</sup> to my great joy for the first time, I heard them, they told of that Jesus, full of
         wounds wc<sup>h</sup> was made for poor
         						sinners, this struck me deeply </p>
      <h2>5</h2>
      <p> then I was soon taken into the society, I went on &amp; felt our Sav<sup>r</sup> near my heart &amp; was so happy that I thot I wanted nothing more, in his way
         						I went on for near 7 Years, then I began to think of being rec<sup>d</sup> into the Cong<sup>n</sup>, &amp; spoke about it, it happen'd
         						that some were rec<sup>d</sup> before me out of my class, &amp; I was left, then I was griev'd &amp; thot they chose the
         worst, &amp; leave the best, for
         						I tho<sup>t</sup> myself the fittest, I therefore went away perplext indeed, but it did not re main
         long, for my dear Sav<sup>r</sup> soon
         						shew'd me, that I was the worst of all, &amp; my happiness was nothing; then I felt
         quite miserable &amp; tho<sup>t</sup> it is no wonder, that I am
         						unreceived for I am not fit for the Cong<sup>n</sup>, nor any thing else, I tho<sup>t</sup> I had griev'd our Sav<sup>r</sup> so much, that I dare not ask him to forgive me, in this situation I went on for almost
         a week, &amp; on Sunday I went to </p>
      <h2>6</h2>
      <p> hear B<sup>r</sup> LaTrobe preach, he began with inviting all those that were the most sinfull of all,
         &amp; said that our Sav<sup>r</sup>
         						stood ready to forgive every one that w<sup>d</sup> come to him, even just as you are; O then I tho<sup>t</sup> I will go to him &amp; try
         						whether he can forgive me, I therefore threw myself at the thro pierced feet
         of our Sav<sup>r</sup>, &amp; said to him dear Savr here is one of the poorest of
         						all thy flock, canst thou forgive me. The feeling w<sup>ch</sup> over power'd me, at that hour, my poor tongue is not able to express; it was as if
         our
         							Sav<sup>r</sup> said to me, I forgive thee all thy sins, yes I forgive thee ev'ry thing &amp; own thee
         as one of my little Flock. </p>
