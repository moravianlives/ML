      <h2>Beterous Atkinson</h2>
      <p> Our S<sup>r</sup><a href="#mlper000570.html">Beterous Atkinson</a> was born<br></br><em>May the 4<sup>th</sup> 1742</em> at <a href="#mlpla000102.html">Wike in Birstal Parish</a>. Tho'
         						<br></br> she was still baptised in the Church of England, yet as <br></br> her Parents belong'd to the Br<sup>n</sup> from the time of the <br></br> first awakening in this Country, she from her <br></br> Childhood was in the
         						Care of the Sisters. But <br></br> as nothing very particular of the Work of our <br></br>Lord was observed in her Heart, she in her <em>21<sup>st</sup> Year</em><br></br> took some little offence, which ended in a Confusion<br></br> of Mind, and of Consequence a Coldness and Shyness<br></br> towards those, who sought the Prosperity of her Soul <br></br><del>took place</del> which continued till she was married on <br></br><em>Sept. 21. 1766</em>. The uneasiness of Heart which she was <br></br> never quite free
         						from, become now serious, and this <br></br> was the Period of her Life, in which she was <br></br> actually awakened, and saw and felt that she had <br></br>
         							never known our dear Sav<sup>r</sup>, as a Sinner. She <br></br> now sought again for Fellowship with the Cong<sup>n</sup><br></br> and in <em>Dec. 1769</em> she was readmitted into the Society, <br></br> and after repeated
         						Supplications she was recieved <br></br> into the Cong<sup>n</sup> April 15<sup>th</sup>.
         							1770. She was now at times <br></br>very chearful and increased in the Knowledge of <br></br> herself. Last winter she fell into a lingering state <br></br>
         							of Health, and tho' no Pains were spared towards <br></br> her Recovery, yet it was all in Vain, and a regular </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> consumptive Disorder took Place. As she had <br></br> entertain'd great Hopes of overcoming this Sickness, <br></br> she was so much the more disappointed when she <br></br> was asured of the Contrary, and a certain Fear<br></br> of Death siezed her, which made
         						her at first very <br></br> heavy; But she pray'd our dear Sav<sup>r</sup> so long, till
         						<br></br> he was graciouslypleased to remove this from <br></br> her. From thence ensued a settled Hearts Desire<br></br> and longing to be with him the sooner the better, <br></br> and she grew so remarkably in the inner Con, that <br></br> it was a Pleasure to behold it. She had a great <br></br> desire to enjoy the h. Sacrament <sup>while</sup> here, which she <br></br> also obtained June 24<sup>th</sup> and
         						the Days following <br></br> she was inexpressibly Happyin her Heart, and <br></br> thus she kept growing in our LordGrace and <br></br>longing after his coming till the <em>15<sup>th</sup>
            								of July</em><br></br> when a few Moments before her Soul took <br></br> flight she still said: Sweet Jesus! Her dying <br></br> life lasted 29 years and 2 months. </p>PAGE BREAK</body>
