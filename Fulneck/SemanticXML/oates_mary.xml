					<p> Thy blood, thy blood the deed hath wrought ye I was born <date type="birth" when-iso="1747-06-26">June 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1747</date> in <placeName>Great

						called home to our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> when I was only <date when-iso="1749" cert="medium">2 y<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> old</date>, and my Mother
						was left with five children of whom I was the youngest, I can remember when very young being sent to the <name event="religious">Children&apos;s meetings</name> and liked them
						very much and hearing of our <roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> love to children, made an imprewssion on my heart and that verse; Dearest child<hi

						youth without knowing or experiencing much, untill I was anout <date when-iso="1765" cert="medium">18 years</date>. I had a great desire to live in a <orgName en="congregation"
								><orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName></orgName> but as I was the only daughter, I could not leave my mother, It was at that time the

						that I could neither enjoy the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> nor the World. I now fully, experienced the truth of that text. The carnal
						mind is enmity with <persName type="deity">God</persName>. I felt my sinful inclinations, and the desire to enjoy the World, so strong that I sometimes thought; I did not care
						what became of me, I said once in my grief, I will never be in the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> yet my heart condemnd me. One night

							<placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulnec</placeName>, and called to see <persName><roleName type="honorific">S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Seidel</persName> who was
						then the <name office="labouress" memoirSubject="no">Labouress</name>, she looked earnestly at me and asked what I thought, for if the hurt had turned inwardly, I might have
						died in a moment, this was like a thunderbolt to my soul. I went to the preaching but could hear nothing for <name type="emotion">misiry feeling</name> that I was not let to
						die. I returned home but had no rest. reflecting on my <name type="emotion">unhappy state</name>, my earnest pray&apos;r and desire was now that our <roleName type="honorific"
							>Saviour</roleName> would pardon all my sins.</p>
					<p> At that time there much said in the meetings, that <add place="above">if we had any</add> clearness of our sinfulness, we should see our <roleName type="honorific"
							>Saviour</roleName> in his crucified form, this brought me into self working and I thought that I never could be saved unless I had that particular manifestation in which I
						heard it describd However one morning when I awoke, it was as if our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> said to me. I know the thoughts which I think towards thee,
						thoughts of peace? that word <hi rend="underline">peace</hi>. <name type="emotion">comforted my heart</name>, and has always been something to me thro my future course, This

						the peace of <persName type="deity">God</persName> which I felt on that occasion, I shall never forget. I now spent my time happily and enjoyed the meetings, when I awoke in
						the morn<hi rend="superscript">g</hi> it was my first pleasing thought. I shall hear of our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> to day. I wished much to partake of

					<p> the <name event="communion">H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></name> but it was long before that favour was granted me. A conversation previous to it with the late
								<persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Tranecker</persName>, proved a great blessing to me, He asked if I had felt a clearness
						that our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> had pardoned all my sins, to which I answered as mentioned before, upon he spoke very encouraging words to me, and said
						that our <roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> ways were different with every poor sinners.</p>
					<p>
						<date when-iso="1776-12-08">Decr 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1776</date> I had the favour to partake for the first time of the <name event="communion">H Com<hi

						comfortably, tho I had many schol schools for my own heart. but our <roleName type="honorific">Savior</roleName> helped me and proved my faithful friend.</p>
					<p> After the happy departure of my dear Mother whom I nursed to my end, I went to live at <placeName>Heckmondwyke</placeName> to care for my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						Children, where I staid until <date when-iso="1783-06-28">June 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1783</date> when I came to the <placeName>S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							house</placeName> here. I entered this house with my whole heart, according to my wished for desire, and no trials whatsoever have made me wish to leave it. My own temper
						and work made it sometimes trying, but little uneasinesses were soon settled again, and I can truly say that my living in this house has proved a Blessing to me. Where I have
						learned to know more of myself and of our <roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> leading</p>
