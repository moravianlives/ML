					<lb/>When ye firsd Choir Lords Supper was kept here by the
					<lb/>dear Desiple and ye Mother, She had the grace to be
					<lb/>one of that Company, the feeling of which has remaind
					<lb/>always ye same as at that present hour She has Spoke
					<lb/>about it in her Sickness with such a feeling that it melted
					<lb/>ye heart of all those who were about her, She has been here
					<lb/>in the Choir house a very Usefull Person, in translaiting
					<lb/>an Writeing Choir discorses, and many other things
					<lb/>belonging to the house
					<lb/>Since the Girls EOconemy come to Yorkshier, She has
					<lb/>kept them their Writeing school with faithfullness, and
					<lb/>they miss her very much, She had a perticulear Gift
					<lb/>for makeing hymns both for her self and others,
					<lb/>At the time when ye Girls Oconemy came here, her
					<lb/>Leges began to Swell, and be painfull to her, She
					<lb/>also Lost her Voice for Singing and it was hard for
					<lb/>her to Speak we thought She wou&apos;d be better, and it
					<lb/>semd so for a wile but after wards it returnd, and Setled
					<lb/>on her Longs, and She began to Spit Bloud again
					<lb/>at New years Night watch just when ye Congregation
					<lb/>fell on her knees before her Bredegroom at ye Entrey in
					<lb/>of ye New year, it was impressd on her heart, that this
					<lb/>was the Last She shou&apos;d ever keep here, She weept
					<lb/>exceedingly, and Said in her heart, Dear Saviour
					<lb/>Shall I keep my Next Watch with thee, or in another
					<lb/>Congregation; The soon got the feeling that if Shoud
					<lb/>be with him, but She kept it to her self
					<lb/>About the Midle of April, She was Suddenly Seasd
					<lb/>With a fit, her Disorder turnd to a Consumption
					<lb/>&amp; She was now obliged to take to ye Sickroom, She grew
					<lb/>Weaker from day to day, and as we could see planly, that
					<lb/>her time drew near, We let her Mother know who Came
					<lb/>Soon after, and Stay&apos;d with her till her Departuer, which
					<lb/>was a great Satisfaction to her ye 18<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> instant She was taken
					<lb/>with Convultion fits, about, 6 in ye Morning we thought
					<lb/>She would go, but She Recoverd again, being very Sory
					<lb/>that our Saviour had not taken her so that we could heardly
					<lb/>perswade her to be Satisfied, in ye after noon She desierd to
					<lb/>See her room Sisters, and Gave each something to Remember
					<lb/>her, Kissed them and begd them to give her Love to S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Mary
