					<lb/>3. John Thompson Beck, aged 22 years/
					<lb/>Previous to his illness he gave no indication of
					<lb/>spiritual life; for tho&apos; a moral character, his mind was so
					<lb/>fixed on earthly pursuits, that it produced a degree
					<lb/>of hardness of heart and feeling not often found in one
					<lb/>so young. All his affections were enlisted in the acqui
					<lb/>sition of money, after for which he panted with fearful 
					<lb/>eagerness. In this state he continued for a considera
					<lb/>ble time after he was confined to the house, and even
					<lb/>long after it was apparent that he would no get better.
					<lb/>So hard were his feelings that it was painful to visit
					<lb/>him, and so severe was the conflict on his mind when
					<lb/>he saw that death would soon put an end to al his
					<lb/>schemes, that it was truly distressing. The mental
					<lb/>struggle and his fond clinging to life, reeked and tor
					<lb/>tured his soul. Many times have I left the house

					<lb/>with the most painful feelings, and had I not been con
					<lb/>vinced that the Word of reconciliation can soften
					<lb/>the most obdurate heart, I should have desponded. Fre
					<lb/>quent and fervent were my prayers, that the Lord
					<lb/>would open the eyes of this young man. Still no signs
					<lb/>of spiritual life appeared; my conversations with
					<lb/>him, the reading of the scripture, and Hymns, see
					<lb/>med to fall on a rock. At length the grace of God
					<lb/>triumphed, and this unhappy state gave way to sen
					<lb/>timents and feelings of a different kind.
					<lb/>The first symptoms of a sounder state of mind
					<lb/>appeared some months ago. He became an humble
					<lb/>inquirer and listened to the instructions given him
					<lb/>in spiritual things; and the silent tears rolling down
					<lb/>his cheeks, proved that degree of light was spin
					<lb/>ning up in his soul. His friends observed the
					<lb/>change with pleasure; but I thought it was
					<lb/>prudent to take no notice of it, but his alteration
					<lb/>should be diverted from the great object of his
					<lb/>faith and absorbed in himself and his feelings.
					<lb/>He now loved the Lord Jesus; he loved to hear
					<lb/>of His sacrifice and death. His confessions showed
					<lb/>much humility and a hope of happiness groun
					<lb/>ded in the atonement of Christ.
					<lb/>One day, about a fortnight after this change
					<lb/>had taken place, when he was more communi
					<lb/>cative than he had been before, I ventured to
					<lb/>remark, that he had different thoughts and

					<lb/>feelings now from what he had had a few
					<lb/>weeks before ago, he ascented, expressing his
					<lb/>thankfulness that this was the case. To my
					<lb/>question, &quot;When did you begin to think more
					<lb/>seriously on these things, and what led you to it?&quot; 
					<lb/>he replied; &quot;Do you remember the evening
					<lb/>when you and my uncle were here, and conversing
					<lb/>about the love of Jesus, our Saviour, in giving His
					<lb/>life a ransom for sinners, suffering and dyeing on
					<lb/>the cross for our sins, and of His mercy in saving
					<lb/>all who come to Him in faith? That conversa
					<lb/>tion I could not forget, and for three hours after
					<lb/>I went to bed, I was thinking about it. I prayed
					<lb/>for grace to believe; I prayed for pardon and
					<lb/>I felt a hope that I should not be lost, that Jesus
					<lb/>would save me. Since then my mind has at
					<lb/>times been very comfortable, when I think of
					<lb/>my Saviour and pray to Him.&quot;
					<lb/>From that day the operations of the Holy
					<lb/>Spirit on his heart became more evident, and
					<lb/>showed their blessed effects by a complete surrender
					<lb/>of himself to the Lord, and submission to His will;
					<lb/>and by being delivered from the fear of death, and
					<lb/>bearing his severe suffering with exemplary pa
					<lb/>tience, often saying, &quot;It is the Lord&apos;s will, let Him
					<lb/>do with me what He pleases.&quot; He was mercifully
					<lb/>preserved from any reasons of gloom or darkness
					<lb/>of mind, and to the last confined in a tranquil

					<lb/>and peaceful state. He had buried his hopes on
					<lb/>the Rock of ages, and in a childlike manner fixed
					<lb/>his mind on the suffering of the Lamb of God. In
					<lb/>consequence of this, tho&apos; his frames and feeling varied,
					<lb/>he was kept in perfect peace. Eight weeks ago,
					<lb/>when racked with the most excruciating pains of body,
					<lb/>his soul was graciously supported by inward conso
					<lb/>lations. Peace beamed in his countenance, and
					<lb/>joy glowed in his expressions. &quot;Don&apos;t weep for me&quot;
					<lb/>Addressing those present he said, &quot;Don&apos;t weep
					<lb/>for me; it will soon be all over; my Saviour is
					<lb/>great; He will not leave me.&quot; Subsequently
					<lb/>his pains were partially relieved; when he never
					<lb/>failed to impress the importance of eternal things
					<lb/>on all who visited him.
					<lb/>On Sunday August 13<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> he was he was asur
					<lb/>ably to his earnest desire, acknowledged a member
					<lb/>of our Church, and commended to the sympathy
					<lb/>and prayer, of the cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi>. and in the evening
					<lb/>the H. Communion was administered to him
					<lb/>and his parents, in the presence of the other mem
					<lb/>bers of the family and a few friends. Du
					<lb/>ring this solemn act the peace of God was power
					<lb/>fully felt by all present, and he himself testified
					<lb/>by his look, his the heavenly joy that filled his
					<lb/>soul. When the service was over he exclaimed,
					<lb/>&quot;this has been a blessed meeting; nothing but

					<lb/>heaven can exceed this.&quot; His bodily sufferings
					<lb/>were forgotten, and the happenings of his soul seemed
					<lb/>almost too great for his weak frame to enterain.
					<lb/>The day after, speaking to one of his sisters of his en
					<lb/>joyment, he was unable to express himself in
					<lb/>language sufficiently strong, saying, &quot;O what a
					<lb/>meeting that was! If you had felt as I did, you
					<lb/>would never forget it.&quot;
					<lb/>The last week of his life was one of very severe
					<lb/>suffering, but of inward peace. In the midst of his
					<lb/>sufferings he frequently exclaimed; &quot;Glory, glory be
					<lb/>to God! I shall soon be with Him. I am going fast;
					<lb/>my Saviour will soon come to fetch me home. I 
					<lb/>shall soon be with him in Heaven; there I shall
					<lb/>see Him face to face; I shall be near Him and shall
					<lb/>see the wounds He bore for my sins.&quot; At one of my
					<lb/>last visits to him, when he appeared very near
					<lb/>his end, he said, turning his face to me, &quot;You will
					<lb/>soon have to preach my funeral sermon. I wish
					<lb/>the young people may take warning by me, and be
					<lb/>led to give themselves to the Lord.&quot;
					<lb/>The Satturday before he died, he was much exhau
					<lb/>sted by pain, and could say very little; but seemed to
					<lb/>derive comfort from the words addressed to him.
					<lb/>When about to leave him he exerted himself to say
					<lb/>something, the substance of which was, that he enjoyd
					<lb/>sweet comfort and peace by in feeling our Saviour&apos;s pre
					<lb/>sence, and in meditating on His sufferings &amp; death, ad
					<lb/>ding, &quot;O how I long to go and see The Lamb of God, who
					<lb/>died for me &amp;c.&quot; On shaking hands with him he said with 
					<lb/>a smile, &quot;All will be well at last.&quot; He departed the following Tuesday.
