            <lb/>The Life of the mar<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> Sister Mary Calvert
            <lb/>who entered into the Joy of her Lord July 18<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1772.
            <lb/>The following is taken from her own Mouth
            <lb/>"I was born at Pudsey in the Parish of Calverly Feb. 17<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1710.
            <lb/>My parents being Presbiterians, I was brought up
            <lb/>very strictly in the same Religion. In my seventh
            <lb/>year my Father departed this Life, &amp; my Mother being
            <lb/>a very pious Woman &amp; a strict observer of the Duties
            <lb/>of her Religion, was very careful about my Education.
            <lb/>I attribute it partly thereto, &amp; partly to a Concern I
            <lb/>had upon my Mind from my Childhood about my Sal
            <lb/>vation, that I was not drawn into the sinful ways
            <lb/>&amp; Course of the World. Indeed when I grew up
            <lb/>into the girls Years, I learned to know more of my
            <lb/>Depravity &amp; also perceived a Tendency in me to the
            <lb/>World, &amp; to be like other people; but
            <lb/>as soon as such a Desire arose in me I was very mise
            <lb/>able always feeling the most terrible Stings in my
            <lb/>Conscience, and a Fear of being Lost. I frequently
            <lb/>read the Scriptures, by which the Concern of my Mind
            <lb/>was increased, as I saw from thence that my Soul
            <lb/>was not in a Safe Condition. In my 21<hi rend="superscript:true;">st</hi> Year
            <lb/>I married my present Husband who was of the Esta
            <lb/>blished Church, but he being also a serious Man
            <lb/>&amp; under a real Concern about his Salvation, and
            <lb/>moreover saw that to he must be
            <lb/>lost if he was to depart this Life in Condition
            <lb/>he then was, thought it might be better for his Soul
            <lb/>to turn Presbyterian, he which he accordingly
            <lb/>did, &amp; thus we continued together 
            <lb/>toiling &amp; striving hard in this Religion in Order
            <lb/>to find Peace &amp; Salvation for our Souls. We also went
            <lb/>frequently to the Communion. But amidst all this 
            </p>
            <pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_30_CalvertMary-02.jpg" n="2"/>
            <p>
            <lb/>I did not find that which I wanted and must have for
            <lb/>the Satisfaction of my Heart. We moved from Idle to
            <lb/>Bolton, where we attended the preaching of the Methodists
            <lb/>for 4 years together; but as we even here did not find
            <lb/>that which satisfied our Hearts, and remained destitute
            <lb/>of Peace, so we never joined the Society. From hence we
            <lb/>removed again to Pudsey, where we endeavoured to
            <lb/>satisfy our Hearts by mixing the Presbyterian and
            <lb/>Methodist Religions together, but neither did this an
            <lb/>swer, for I still remained uneasy in my Mind &amp; uncer
            <lb/>tain about my Salvation. Having a grand Child with
            <lb/>us, I was much concerned how to preserve him from
            <lb/>the Wickedness of the World, &amp; hearing of the School of
            <lb/> the Brethren kept by B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Abr<hi rend="superscript:true;">m</hi> Rogers, I applied to him
            <lb/>for Leave to send this Child to the School, thinking it
            <lb/>would be best preserved there. He spoke heartily with
            <lb/>me about the Aim of this School, &amp; the Importance
            <lb/>of preserving Children from the World &amp; Sin, &amp; took
            <lb/>the Child on a Trial. This Child took a pleasure in
            <lb/>learning Verses, &amp; going to the Children's Meetings, yea
            <lb/>he was so delighted with the Brethren that he was not
            <lb/>willing to go with me on Sundays but would
            <lb/>go to Fulneck, &amp; moreover pressed me to go with him
            <lb/>thither. Having been struck by the Verses he had learn
            <lb/>ed &amp; by what he related concerning the Meetings, I
            <lb/>agreed to go with my Boy one Sunday to Fulneck where
            <lb/>I heard B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> LaTrobe preach, &amp; his Discourse was just
            <lb/>adapted to my Case. Ah! thought I, this is the very Thing
            <lb/>I want; O Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> is here set forth as ready to save lost
            <lb/>&amp; undone Sinners; and it is just such a Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> that I want.
            <lb/>Having thus heard the sweet &amp; genuine Gospel, I never
            <lb/>went more either to the Presbyterians or Methodists
            <lb/>but constantly to the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn's</hi> Preaching, where my poor
            <lb/>seeking Soul was much comforted &amp; blest by hearing
            <lb/>of that loving Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> who had done to much for me, &amp; was
            
            <cb/>

                <lb/>willing to receive such needy Creatures as I found
            <lb/>myself to be. In the Year 1768 My Husband &amp; I were
            <lb/>rec<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> into the Society to our great Joy, &amp; the special Ac
            <lb/>quaintance we had afterwards with the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> proved
            <lb/>a great Blessing to my Heart. My principal Concern
            <lb/>being to know our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> truly &amp; experience him as my
            <lb/>Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>, I often prayed in my Distress for this Grace, &amp; He
            <lb/>kindly attended to me, &amp; fully satisfied me in this
            <lb/>important Matter by appearing clearly to me in his
            <lb/>crucified Figure &amp; granting me to see my Name
            <lb/>written in his Hands whereby I was fully comforted
            <lb/>being assured that He was mine &amp; that I was his &amp;
            <lb/>that my Sins were done away thro' his precious Blood.
            <lb/>He has since then been very gracious &amp; faithful to me
            <lb/>&amp; kept my Heart in Peace &amp; Communion with Him.
            <lb/>The special Acquaintance I had afterwards &amp; private
            <lb/>Conversation with my Labouress has been of great
            <lb/>Service &amp; blessing to me, which I have much Reason
            <lb/>to be thankful to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> for, as also for what I
            <lb/>have enjoyed in my Bands &amp; in bandlike Conversations
            <lb/>with other Sisters. August 13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1770 I had the Grace
            <lb/>granted me to be received into the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>, which
            <lb/>proved a great Blessing to me, &amp; our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> began
            <lb/>a new Work of Grace an my heart; but what I enjoyed
            <lb/>when I was admitted the first Time to the holy Comm
            <lb/>munion with the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>, was so great &amp; had such an
            <lb/>Effect upon me that I am not able to express in
            <lb/>Words the Blessing it was to me. At the prostration during the enjoyment
            <lb/>of his broken Body it was as if my dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> was
            <lb/>bodily present, entered in a new Covenant
            <lb/>with me, &amp; said distinctly to me: Thou art mine &amp; I am
            <lb/>thine; &amp; this He has kept clear to me to this Day; &amp;
            </p>
            <pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_30_CalvertMary-03.jpg" n="3"/>
            <p>
            <lb/>now I only wait for that happy Hour when it shall
            <lb/>please Him to fetch me Home to Himself. So far her
            <lb/>own Acc<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi>, which the partly related to a Brother &amp; partly
            <lb/>to a Sister, 
            <lb/>She was indeed a venerable Sister, loved &amp;
            <lb/>was beloved. She had thro' Grace got a true Foundation
            <lb/>on Jesus Christ &amp; his Merits &amp; had a real Connexion with Him.
            <lb/>She prized her Lot of Grace highly to know her Redeemer
            <lb/>&amp; to be numbered to his People, &amp; her Heart was
            <lb/>truly thankful for the Mercies &amp; Blessings she
            <lb/>enjoyed. As she loved her Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> tenderly, her Mouth
            <lb/>overflowed with what the Heart was full of, so that
            <lb/>it was a real Refreshment to be in her Company &amp;
            <lb/>hear her speak of what she enjoyed.
            <lb/>Some Time ago she begun to grow weak &amp; feeble, &amp;
            <lb/>so continued from Time to Time till her Departure; but
            <lb/>her Days of Sickness were spent in that same chearful
            <lb/>childlike &amp; confident Manner as be in her
            <lb/>health. Her crucified Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> was her Object &amp; He sup
            <lb/>ported &amp; Comforted her by his precious Nearness.
            <lb/>She often spoke of her Desire to be at Home with
            <lb/>Christ, wishing ,with Resignation for the Hour soon
            <lb/>to strike, which came to pass the
            <lb/>day above mentioned, being blest thereto by her
            <lb/>Husband, in the 63 year of her Age.
