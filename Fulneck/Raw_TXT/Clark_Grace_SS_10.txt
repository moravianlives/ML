ble Means have been used to the last.
In May she began to speak much of going

of being recovering. Her only great concern was
to be buried on Lamb's Hill, which she
desired very often, & firmly believed if
she should live so long till a place was
appointed for her. In her sickness she was
always contented & happy, spoke very much of
the wounds & especially of the Side's Hole, of which
she also dream'd continually, & invited her the
Sisters, who stood about her, to come with her
into that Hole, there was Blood enough for
them all. once she said she had seen the dear Saviour
& he said to her, I am thy Husband, thou art


& he said to her I am thy Husband, thou art
mine & am thine, but he had a long vest
ment on, so that she could not see the wounds.
She begg'd him ye He would come an other Time
with his wound Holes for she lik'd to see him
best therein, He mind at it & open'd the
cloke so of she could see the Side's Hole, into
which she went & drank plentifully of His Blood.

thou last thy place eternally here Soul took
it's flight into the Side's Hole, being fetched
away by the kiss of her Husband, which was
plainly to be perceived in her countenance.
