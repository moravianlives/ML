Some particulars of Martha Wood last sickness
One evening she was sitting with in company
with her father nobody else being present
She asked her Father if he thought she would
have as much to do to get to Heaven as
her Mother had, he told her he believed she
would not as she was very young and
if she prayed to God to have mercy upon her
he had no doubt he would answer her prayer
She then asked what they had to do in
Heaven if she would know her Savour
likewise when she got there, he told
She would; She then said shall I know my
Mother, my Brother and as several other persons
who She knew before they died, he said
he believed when She Died she would
know them and join in singing and
praising God and the
Lamb for ever and ever, this answer
gave her great Satisfaction
One day several of her play girls being beside
the door and using such words as was
displeasing to her she said to her Sister
Fanny do drive them of off the door


I dont like to hear foul words it puts bad
thoughts into my mind & makes me very
uneasy, She told her she would and hoped
she would pray to God to dispel all bad thoughts
from her mind, she said she always and
at another times, during severe bodaly
affliction her Sister Fanny hearing her talk
ing the drew towards her and found she
was praying. She asked her if she stood
in need of any thing, her was nothing
that you can give me
her Uncle John Wood visited her often
during the latter part of her illness
and she gave him great satisfaction
particularly after reading to her some
of our hymns especially the hymn No 787
which says who what a wretched heart have I
1st how full of sin and shame
ways
how obstinate continually
stood
stood
how day by day to blame
2nd Lord look on me 'midst all my faults
and when thou seest my guilt
my wicked words and foolish thouts
3 think why thy blood was spilt
In that most precious river cleanse
and wash my crimes away
my selfishness and that offence
which I have done to day


and two verses of No 788 struck her very
forcably viz who Lord forgive a sinful child
1st whose heart as all unclean
how bad am I, and how defiled
how prone to every Sin
2nd Oh change me vile and stubborn heart
like thee, Oh make me pure
To me thy love divine impart
Keep me from sin secure
On Easter Tuesday Evening he visited her
and found her very weak and hoarse
he said Martha thou cannot talk
much to me I will read a hymn or
two to thee, which she very kindly
accepted, and when he was leaving
her she desired him to pray with her
which he did and we has ve reasons to beleive
it was a happy prayer to her, and
affecting to all the company present
there scarcely being a dry cheek in the
room - after he had left the house she
kneeled down and offered up a very affecting
prayer and said to the company now I
am not affraid to dye
