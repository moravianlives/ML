      <h2>Sarah Cennick</h2>
      <p>The Life of the S. <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000227.html">Sr Sarah Cennick</a> who went happily home <em>Jan<sup>y</sup> 24<sup>th</sup> 1770</em><br></br>I was born June the 12<sup>th</sup> old Style 1712 in <a href="#mlpla000111.html">Reading
            								Berks</a>. <br></br> was baptiz'd in the Church of England and brought up in that
         						Comunion. <br></br> The first thing I remember is the simple and happy intercourse <br></br> I lived in with the Lord: I knew he lov'd me; and I lov 'd him; &amp; therefore <br></br> used to have recourse to Him
         						without the least reserve. </p>
      <p> When I was about <em>5 Years old</em>, I remember to have been particularly <br></br> naughty &amp; selfwilld, which caused me much heaviness, tho' I strove all <br></br> I could to divert and get rid of the Conviction by play &amp;c. But <br></br> running hastily into my Mothers room,
         						where she was sitting with <br></br> my late d<sup>r</sup>Bro<sup>r</sup> <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000408.html">John</a> - then an Infant - lying in her lap. <br></br> I saw her weeping with lifted up hands, and heard her
         						pray. I was <br></br>much affected: But felt so hard, to acknowledge my fault, but <br></br> upon repeatedly asking my Mother, why she cried and what she <br></br> was saying?  She referr'd the Cause to me and Said: "I was praying <br></br> for you and for your Brother." This
         							pierc'd me through, and I <br></br> thought my heart would break. For I thought, The
         							Lord also is <br></br>greived! I therefore silently withdrew condemn'd and asham'd<br></br> and hasted to a private Place, where with many Tears, I beged <br></br> Him to forgive me; which he most
         							graciously did directly, and <br></br> all my Burthen instantly removed. </p>
      <p> My Father and his Relations being all Quakers of the <br></br> most primitive sort, and my Mother and hers all strict Church</p>
      <p><br></br> of England; Her attachment to, and chief acquaintance were the <br></br> Clergy; So that I had the Oppertunity of an intimate familiarity
         						<br></br> with <sup>each</sup>, not perceiving, at this time, the least disunion on either Side. </p>
      <p> Our Parish Vicar and his Family was a part of our <br></br> most intimate acquaintance, and his Daughter, who had taken <br></br> a liking to me from my
         						Infancy, calling me her own Child, <br></br> at last prevailed with my Parents, to take me more particularly <br></br> home to her; But our houses Joining each other, I was nearly
         						<br></br> as much with my Parents as I was with them. This lady, <br></br> taking me, to a friends house with her, I slip'd out from <br></br> the Company, and saw two small Boats
         						fastened to the <br></br> Landing Place in a deep Moat, I got into one of them <br></br> and reached out of it to the Side of the other Boat: <br></br> when both parting, and swiming
         						from each other <br></br> had dragged me out of that I stood in, had not the toes <br></br> of my shoes hitch'd in something, and prevented it: <br></br> Thus hanging over the Water
         						between both, I had <br></br> scarce time to give my self up for lost, Before I Slip'd <br></br> my hold and pitched into the Water, where to my Joyfull<br></br>surprise, instead of Sinking I found, as it were, Hands </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p>bearing so strong against my hands as to get and keep my head above <br></br> water. Yea those kind Assistants bore me up so long, even till I was <br></br>
         							capable of taking hold with one Hand of that Boat, wherein, all <br></br> while my shoes had hitch'd, but how I recover'd wholly, I never <br></br> could remember, only
         						that, as I came to my self, I was flat on <br></br> my Back, safe and well. I know, who those ministers were, of <br></br> whose kinder Orders they Obey'd obeyed, and thanked them, and Him, <br></br> Friend: beging Him 100 times over: O pray don't let it be found <br></br> out &amp;c. Which, however remarkable, never
         						was. </p>
      <p> I was this Gentlemans* The parish vicarfond Companion also, and oftenIn the memoir, the phrase "the parish vicar" is written in pencil in a different hand Slid unobserv'd to
         						him, when he was retir'd to private Devotion<br></br> sometimes I kneel'd behind, and at other times close by his side, <br></br> that I might be a partaker of those influences, which I beleiv'd, <br></br> he enjoy'd. </p>
      <p> As I Grew older, I had more liberty among the Servants, <br></br>
         						who endeavour'd to seduce me and bring me into all manner of <br></br> Wickedness, as much as they could, But finding me frighten'd, <br></br> and
         							fearing I should tell, they threaten'd me hard, what they <br></br> would do to me, if I did. This brought me more particularly to my <br></br> own
         						Hearts Friend, and they let me alone for sometime; till one <br></br> evening, I went into a back Garden, where a Company of them wo <br></br> got, but I did not know nor think of
         						them, till I was almost <br></br>shock'd to death, and could scarce stagger into <sup>the House</sup><del>door</del>, when, even in <br></br> the very Passage, the Lord met me, Comforted me, and gave me <br></br> the Assurancein my Heart, "He would preserve me for himself <br></br> for ever." This Promise has always been a secret Comfort to me, <br></br> all my Course through, yea even, when in the highest of my Folly <br></br> in the World. I was near <em>8 years
            							old</em>, &amp; made a memorandum of that <br></br> important Day. I was kept more close to my learning, and was <br></br> instructed in all the Principles of the Church. I
         						also got Courage<br></br> to discover those notorious deceivers, without their knowing it was me <br></br> Yet my Heart departed from its dearest Object, and I became as <br></br> Formal and vain as
         						any Body; I saw myself a fair Candidate <br></br> for the World; but also, Ruin, Destruction, and eternal death <br></br> stood as fair before me. This made me go on heavily, but I could <br></br> tell no one: And as I was under Preparation for the H. Com<sup>n</sup><br></br> I was the more distress'd; Sometimes in dispair and sometimes <br></br>desperate. In this Situation I went to Evening Prayers, but I <br></br> could neither pray, nor desire. I was so condemn'd; But in the <br></br> Begining of the last Prayers, my Heart became as melting Wax, <br></br> and as such a Wretch I turn'd again to my Friend, and begg'd for mercy<br></br> and got Confidence to trust and rely on him. I had sometime before <br></br> privately made it out in my own
         						mind, that, as Oppertunity should <br></br> serve, I would privately retire to a Cloister, and in that especiall <br></br> manner dedicate myself to the Lord Forever. In</p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> In my <em>17<sup>th</sup> year</em> it was thought proper by my Friends, that I should
         							<br></br> go to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> for further Improvement. I was receiv'd with
         						the <br></br>greatest heartiness, and every one was kindly officious in bringing <br></br> me to public Places, and shewing me the Curiosities of the
         						Town. I <br></br> saw the Glory's of the World - and loved it - and concluded, as I had <br></br> often been told, I was made for the World, for it
         						suited my Inclination <br></br> and tast every way; And I had well nigh set through all Convictions, <br></br> Though at the Bottom I had a Condemn'd
         							heart and guilty Conscience. <br></br> My Mother being in <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> at this time took me with her, to see a <br></br> Friend of hers in <a href="#mlpla000130.html">Bedlam</a>, and surveying the
         						many Shocking objects <br></br> there, she turned to me and said. "This is the <sup>sad</sup> effect of
         							Love and Pride." <br></br> I made her no answere; but despairingly thought: and
         						this will <br></br> one day be my unhappy Case unless <a href=".html">God</a> exert his Almighty <br></br> Power in rescuing
         						me. </p>
      <p>I soon followed my Mother privately to <a href="#mlpla000111.html">Reading</a>, giving all my <br></br>
         						Acquaintance the Slip; But was soon surrounded with my old <br></br> Friends and Acquaintance who were very desireous to hear news, and <br></br>
         						learn more particularly the Fashions of the Town. I told them, I was <br></br> quite tired of all those things, and therefore resolv'd soon to retire from <br></br> all, and come and
         						live in a quite different way: If any of them w<del>h</del>ere <br></br> inclin'd to make one of the Company, when I came to settle at home, <br></br> it could be made out. </p>
      <p> From this time I had no rest for my poor distresstHeart &amp; mind <br></br> Therefore in my <em>21<sup>st</sup> year</em>I left <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> the Last time, to put in practice <br></br>
         						what I had so long purposed, renewing my Acquaintance with the <br></br> most solid and religious Part of my Friends. I followed as near <br></br> as I could. Step for step, with my
         						Mother &amp; <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000408.html">Brother</a>, who had <br></br>
         						begun some time ago a more religious Course of Life; But, alas! <br></br> I grew faint hearted and tir'd: And
         						seeing all my Works, Prayers <br></br> and Duties, good for nothing at all, and I myself that same de- <br></br> plorable Creature as ever I was, I cry'd
         							out in the Bitterness of <br></br> my Soul: O Lord<a href=".html">Jesus Christ</a>' if this is the way to Heaven, I shall <br></br> never come there! My distress still
         						increased, being more &amp; more <br></br> Sensible of my Degeneracy; But above all did my base ingratitude<br></br> to my once so tender Lover fill me with horror and Dejection. </p>
      <p> We had heard of the Awakening in <a href="#mlpla000131.html">Oxford</a>, where my <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000408.html">B<sup>r</sup></a> went, <br></br> got
         						acquainted with several, and brought <a href=".html">M<sup>r</sup>. Kinchin</a><del>g</del> to our house; <br></br> and afterwards
         							<a href=".html">M<sup>r</sup> Wesleys</a>, <a href=".html">Hutchins</a>, <a href=".html">Whitfield</a> &amp;c. I was much <br></br>perplex'd in my own mind at this rash (as I thought then) proceeding <br></br> of my <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000408.html">Brothers</a>, fearing a Schism in the Church. But being convinced <br></br> of the truth of their Doctrine, was soon Zealouslyattached thereto. <br></br> But the Preaching being in our House, it made a great stir in the <br></br> Town, and caused us much Trouble and disgrace; So that my Mother <br></br> hearing of it in <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, came home, and put an intire Stop to it. </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> Hereupon my <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000408.html">Brother</a> went to <a href="#mlpla000030.html">Bristoll</a>, and I, and a well disposed single<br></br> Woman took a house in the Town; but the Preaching was given up. <br></br> By these
         						means got the ill Will of all my Friends and Relations <br></br> My Acquaintance also shun'd me, and every one's Face was set against <br></br> me.
         						Thus forsaken of all, and destitute of my best Friend, I grew <br></br>dejected, and quite malancholy. </p>
      <p> In <em>1740</em>I visited <a href="#mlpla000046.html">Kingswood</a> and <a href="#mlpla000030.html">Bristol</a>; but could not be reconcil'd <br></br> to those Agitations among the Methodists at that time. Here I had <br></br>happiness of seeing first our d<sup>r</sup>Bro<sup>r</sup><a href="#mlper000692.html">Toeltshig</a>, who seeing my concern, <br></br> help'd me much. I
         							soon return'd to <a href="#mlpla000111.html">Reading</a>exceedingly distress'd, <br></br> And finding my dear Companion so happy in our Sav<sup>r</sup> and myself <br></br>so wretched, I gave up all hopes of ever being sav'd. But here in <br></br> one moment did
         							my most graciousSaviour reveal Himself to me, <br></br>forgave me all my sin, and in an instant I was dispossess'd of every <br></br>Pain: I could hardly tell if I was in the Body or not. For my heart <br></br> saw nothing but <a href=".html">Jesus</a>. I felt after Sin; but behold! there was <br></br> no Sin. I felt after my own guilt and Distress, but there was <br></br> no Place found for them, and nothing but light surrounded me. <br></br> I had not enjoy'd this happiness long, before my venerable Companion <br></br>fell happily asleep on the Bosom of her eternal Bridegroom. </p>
      <p> At my return the former Disturbances were reviv'd. many were <br></br>distresst concerning their Salvation; And the Clergy being greatly <br></br> perplex'd, endeavour'd to
         						put me to Trouble; But our Saviour<br></br> kept me stay'd upon Him and deliver'd me safe out of their Hands. <br></br> I gave up my House, and went again to <a href="#mlpla000046.html">Kingswood</a>, where <a href="#mlper000366.html">M<sup>r</sup><br></br> Whitfield</a>, my <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000408.html">B<sup>r</sup></a> and others were separated from <a href=".html">M<sup>r</sup> Wesleys</a>, and <br></br> had begun more regular Society, and
         						gave me the care of the <br></br> Single Women, with whom I labour'd as well as I could; <br></br> But knowing my own Insufficiency, and seeing many Irregularities <br></br> creeping in
         						among the Young People, I told my <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000408.html">Bro<sup>r</sup></a> this was not <br></br> what suited me; and therefore I came to <a href="#mlpla000111.html">Reading</a>, where a
         						Widow <br></br>Quaker Gentlewoman had long and often desir'd I would stay with <br></br> her and take<sup>use</sup> her House as my own. I did so, And all my Quaker<br></br> Friends were exceeding kind to me, and earnestlywish'd me to <br></br> settle amongst them; I would have done it, but had no leave from <br></br> our Savr in my
         						own Heart. My Mind was secretly Hankering<br></br> after a Cloister: But my <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000408.html">Bro<sup>r</sup></a> desiringmy Assistance at <br></br><a href="#mlpla000138.html">Tetherton</a>, I went to him, and with all the Money I had, Goods &amp; <br></br> Furniture, engaged
         						with him, and the Peace of <a href=".html">God</a> ruled &amp; rested <br></br> upon us. </p>
      <p> In <em>44</em>I went on a Visit to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, where our late <a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup> Stonehouse</a><br></br> brought me aquainted with my ever dearest <a href="#mlper000699.html">Anna Johanna</a>, with <br></br> whom my Heart was tenderly united, as was hers to me. </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> I had heard of the Order among the Single Sisters, and that it was <br></br> something like a Nunery, which exacted my enquiry and I
         							wish'd once <br></br> to see such a Choir. My <a href="#mlper000408.html">Bro<sup>r</sup></a> had already contracted a large Acquaintance <br></br> with the Brethren, and sometime after gave our Societies into their
         						<br></br> care and went on a Visit to <a href="#mlpla000014.html">Hhaag</a>, and from thence to <a href="#mlpla000114.html">Ireland</a>. <br></br> In his Absence I had the favour of a Visit at <a href="#mlpla000138.html">Tetherton</a> from our
         						late <br></br> d<sup>r</sup><a href="#mlper000566.html">Disciple</a> and <a href="#mlper000701.html">Discipless</a>, <a href="#mlper000700.html">Christel</a>, <a href="#mlper000699.html">Anna Johanna</a> &amp;c. The <a href="#mlper000701.html">Discipless</a><br></br> was particularly hearty with me to, whom, at first, I was somewhat <br></br>reserved; But coming upon Heart Matters, I was quite openhearted, <br></br> and she spoke to me in the most Comfortable and encouraging manner, <br></br> telling me, how tenderly She and her Company felt towards me, and <br></br> assuring me of our Saviours Thoughts of Peace concerning me. </p>
      <p> My <a href="#mlper000408.html">Brother</a> soon after return'd, who told me yet more about the <br></br>single Sis<sup>rs</sup>, and how earnestly he had Pray'd our Sav<sup>r</sup> to bring me <br></br> into their happy Circle, That he knew it was just a Regulation as <br></br> would please
         						me. Upon duly weighing the matter before our Sav<sup>r</sup>, I wrote <br></br> to my much respected Friend, the d<sup>r</sup><a href="#mlper000701.html">Discipless</a> for leave to visit the Cong<sup>n</sup><br></br> in <a href="#mlpla000139.html">Germany</a>, who readily granted me the favour. My Mother also <br></br> at this time, was
         						well inclin'd towards to Bre<sup>n</sup>;       But meeting with <br></br> some unhpy
         						Circumstances, she was turn'd quite against them: And <br></br> tho' I was much Staggered, yet our Sav<sup>r</sup> preserved me, and gave me Courage<br></br> of persevere in my Purpose. Yet I had it hard to get away, and was forc'd <br></br> to leave her against her Will. </p>
      <p> In <em>March 1747</em>I arrived with many more English Brethen and <br></br> Sis<sup>rs</sup> together with <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup></a> &amp; <a href=".html">Sis Teltschig</a> in <a href="#mlpla000014.html">Hhaag</a>, where I m<del>e</del>et with <br></br> the most cordial reception from our d<sup>r</sup><a href="#mlper000566.html">Disciple</a> &amp; <a href="#mlper000701.html">Discipless</a>. <br></br> The Congregation and its regulations I saw with wonder and delight; <br></br> Especially
         						that of the S. Sis<sup>rs</sup>. My first Intention only was to Visit <br></br> the Cong<sup>n</sup>, and not to become a Member thereof; But in <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, on my <br></br> way
         							h<del>e</del>ither, being a Spectator at the Holy Communion, I was so affected<br></br> that I forgott my Resolution; Till by Occasion, soon after my arrival, <br></br> I grew Suspicious, till I was quite confus'd. But having an unreserved <br></br>Confidence to the late d<sup>r</sup><a href="#mlper000701.html">Discipless</a>, I told her all my Concern, who <br></br> with the greatest tenderness &amp; Frankness clear'd up those matters which <br></br> had given me so much
         						pain. I now became quite happy and saw <br></br> the Cong<sup>n</sup> in a right light, and the Beginning of that happy Period, <br></br> which the H Ghost had so many
         						years been preparing me for. </p>
      <p> I had the Grace to be received into the Congregation the same
         							year, <br></br> Was soon after Confirm'd and in <em>Jan 1748</em>was made a happy Partaker <br></br> of the Lords Body and Blood in the H Communion. Here also I
         						<br></br> had the Grace to be admitted into the Class of Intercessors, and soon <br></br> after set out with <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup></a> &amp; <a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup> Boehler</a> &amp;c. for <a href="#mlpla000072.html">England</a>.

      <p> After staying sometime in <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, I was sent to <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, where <br></br> I was one of the Cong<sup>n</sup> Servants, Choir Servant &amp; Helper. In <em>June <br></br> 1750</em>I was called to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, where I enjoy'd
         						many blessings in the <br></br><a href="#mlpla000143.html">Dear Disciples House in Bloomsbury Square</a>.

      <p> In <em>Sept<sup>r</sup> 1758</em>I got a Call to the <a href="#mlpla000279.html">Disciple House</a>, from my <br></br> dear

      <p> My little Room has been a Cabinet of Jewels to me, Therefore I have <br></br> long concluded, that if our Sav<sup>r</sup> took me home here in <a href="#mlpla000084.html">Yorkshire</a>, I <br></br> would die in my nest, and so slip away, as it were incognito <br></br>

      <p> For this Year last past, I have felt that my time was out <br></br> in <a href="#mlpla000041.html">Gummersal</a>, and last summer thought I should get a Call
         						after <br></br> the Synod; but could never find out any Place where I could be sent <br></br> to. I once kept a hearty
         						Band with my Friend about it, at the <br></br> Conclusion of which, and summing up the whole, I said to Him: <br></br> "Now would it not be better thou tookst me home to thy <sup>own dr</sup> self." <br></br> I had no room to suspect any thing of the kind, from what I felt from him <br></br> at that time; <em>But July last</em>, As I was in the Chaple <sup>Garden</sup> at Work, He drew near <br></br> To me in an extraordinary manner,
         						and discover'd to me Such an Union <br></br> &amp; oneness between Him &amp; me, as is altogether unutterable, tho' I <br></br> did attempt to
         						express something of it in a few Verses. </p>
      <p> From this time I had often gentle hints of a Change, of something that would <br></br> take place, which should entirely suit me. </p>
      <p> In <em>August last</em>I got it Voilent Cold, which grew worse &amp; worse, <br></br> And found my Lungs were infected. In the Beginning of
         							<em>Sept last</em>, <br></br>I felt myself strangly ill; so as I had never been before, which lasted <br></br> some few nights &amp; days; And during the whole time, I was most happily<br></br>Comforted with my Friends nearness, Insomuch that I felt no illness at all, <br></br> only that I was weak and drowsy. One night,
         						unasked for, He <br></br> came Close to my Bedside, and stood there. My Heart saw Him, <br></br> And my Soul adored Him!
         						He dispersed intirely in a moment <br></br> every painfull thought and Sensation, inwardly and outwardly <br></br> I
         						felt after one Wound and another sore; But behold! they were all <br></br> healed. I felt after Sin, and there was no sin. I felt after misery<br></br> and Dejection, But there was none to be found; And thus I was made <br></br> sound and whole, except those pleasing Wounds of Love, which He <br></br> had made long before in my enamour'dHeart, But now more <br></br> Deeply impress'd. </p>
      <p> Now it was, He gave me, the soft impression of his Gracious<br></br> intention Concerning me; while I silently worship'd before Him. <br></br> On the <em>26<sup>th</sup> </em>my d<sup>r</sup><a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup> Lorel</a> called on us in her return from <br></br><a href="#mlpla000035.html">Duckenfield</a>, and was quite alarm'd at my seeming bad state <br></br> of
         							Health, would not rest, But insisted on my going to <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, <br></br> To stay there
         						for some time which I did; where I assisted in <br></br> seeing the Sisters for the Communion, and could not forbear to <br></br> drop a word now and
         						then concerning something, the very obscure of <br></br> my happy Situation. On the <em>9<sup>th</sup></em> I return'd to <a href="#mlpla000041.html">Gummersal</a>, where <br></br>my Disorder increased, And my Friend confirmed more </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> Strongly what he had made allready manifest to me. I was very well <br></br> seemingly, fix'd and suited; But my d<sup>r</sup>. <a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup>.

         						could not be <br></br> prevailed upon to be Satisfy'd, unless I came to Fulneck. </p>

         						was <br></br> my most dear and venerable Heart <a href="#mlper000699.html">Anna Johanna</a>; I was also made <br></br>happily sensable of that genuine Love and heartyaffection of the <br></br> Choir in general, And more especially <del>of</del><sup>from</sup> all those in Office; so that <br></br> that peace of <a href=".html">God</a>, and that Sabbath,
         						which I never had heard any <br></br> one possessing, at least so long before their Departure, accompanied <br></br> me here also in the clearest manner, which begun at the time
         						above <br></br> mentioned, when our Sav<sup>r</sup> manifested Himself to me in such an <br></br> especiall manner. But here I must mention some essential <br></br> things, which I forgot to mention in their proper places,
         						viz. <br></br> After all that the Lord had done for me, and I was clear and well <br></br> establish'd in it: One Day, as He &amp; I were solacing ourselves in <br></br> each others love, it came into my mind; But that oneness &amp; union <br></br> which I had
         						possessed in Him. I was not so clear in at this time: He <br></br> shew'd me, I was wholly in Him and He in me, and that we <br></br> were One as he and the Father are One. I saw
         						myself cloathed <br></br> upon in Him, and possessed of all the Bridal Ornaments of the Bridegroom. <br></br> I must therefore ascribe all the Honour and Glory alone to my own d<sup>r</sup>. <br></br> eternal Slaughter'd Lord and Saviour and conclude my <br></br>
         						Narrative with the Greatest truth in all the World: viz. <br></br> That, Where Sin hath abounded, Grace hath abounded <br></br>Much more. </p>
      <p> Our venerable and Happily departed <a href="#mlper000227.html">Sis<sup>r</sup> Sarah Cennick</a>, <br></br> Has in some measure Specify'd How varioussly her Election of Grace<br></br> has <sup>been</sup> manifested w<sup>h</sup>ere-ever her happy Lot Has been cast, during <br></br> Her Course
         						through this vale of tears. </p>
      <p> Her Strong Capacity, Great Gifts, and quick sensations, was <br></br> Iluminated by such extraordinary Grace from the H. Ghost<br></br> As evidently Signalized Her a peculiar Person of Blessed<br></br>remembrance to the Hearts of many Souls. </p>
      <p> Yet amidst all those great Endowments, she had the <br></br>Happiness, through the infinite Mercys of <a href=".html">God</a>, to be throughly
         						<br></br> Convinced of her great depravity in Soul and Body, and <br></br> which truly as a monument of uncommon Mercy and Grace, <br></br> was preserved, in her Earlyest years, From the dangers and <br></br> vain Foibels of her natural Inclinations, and as her own <br></br> words has spoke it,
         						she counted it the highest Dignity</p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> to be rank'd amongst the Chiefest of Sinners, and has with particular<br></br> clearness expresst her mind in a few verses on this subject, in the<br></br> Beginning of her last

      <p> By these Verses something may be understood of that truly <br></br> Evangelical intercourse, which our late happySis<sup>r</sup> had with <br></br> her Souls Bridegroom; She has certainly been favour'd with a <br></br> more than common union and nearness from her Friend &amp; Lover. <br></br> Her Soul
         						magnify'd the Lord, and her Spirit daily rejoiced in God <br></br> her Sav<sup>r</sup> whom she recommended on all Occasstions, with such <br></br> energy, as is not to be expresst in words, which bears an Indelible
         						<br></br> Signature of Blessing in her Choir. During her last Sickness <br></br> we have seen many Blessed Testemonies
         						of this Kind, wherein <br></br> she has plainly shown, that her very Soul was animated with <br></br> new life whenever our Sav<sup>r</sup> or his matters was named, <br></br> Especially with regard to the General and Individual Intercourse <br></br> which
