The course of Life Of the Great Girl, Anna Caritas Rice
Anna Caritas Rice, was born at Leominster Augst 7 1758
in 1760 her Parrents brought her to the Children's Oeconomy
here in Fullneck, Where she was soon at home and belov'd
by both Sistrs & Children, being of a Simple and Loving
disposition, She took great delights in going to the Childns
Meetings, and Singing Verses about Our Savrs Death and
Sufferings, and it was perceptible in her, that her heart
Thereby grew Soft and tender towards Him, as she grew up
for Natural Tendency began to show it self, and upon being
reprov'd on any Ocassion, she grew very Close and thoughtfull,
Which brought her into an unsinnerlike Disposition, but being
Spoke too on that account She was soon Sencible of it,
and became a Sinner about it
in 1768 the got a Swelling in One Arm & Knee, all possible
Means were usd to help her, but to no Purpose, Her
Parrents being acquainted, thought proper to take her to
Wiltshire, were they resided, in Order to try some farther means
as well as Change of Air, She accordingly went with her
Father, Out of Obedeince, tho' with Great reluctancy to part
from the Children, in 1771, She staid with her Dear Parrents
about 7 Months, and then upon her return came Directly into
the Sistrs House seemingly in a better State of health, She
was very soon Quite at home amongst the Girls here to whom
She was a very agreable Companion: as also much belov'd by
The Sistrs, Who cou'd often perceive in her a real Sencible
ling of her heart, notwithstanding her still turn of Mind,


Her last Band before she took to the Sickroom she expressd
with a very tender feeling and many tears, her shortness in the
knowlege of our Savr, & that She had not made better use of
her time in that Respect, which caused a tender Emotion in
all Present, her Illness was of a very Painfull Nature
Having a very troublesome Cough, & Extreme shortness of Breath
Under which she was exceedingly Patient & Seldom ever heard
to complain, She began her illness in Jan 1772, but as it was
a Sickly time with many, it was thought she wou'd get over it
but in april following, she had a kind of Convulsion Fitt
Since which time she declin'd very perceptibly, but did not
take to the sickroom till a fortnight before her Departure,
She kept her last Birthday with her room Companions Augst 7
when she was very Childlike and pritty amongst them, But
did not seem to think she shou'd so soon go to our Savr
tho She was very weak then, a Day or 2 after she took
Quite to the sickroom, She spent her time in her usual
Still way, as patient as cou'd scarcely be expected under
Such a Troublesome Disorder till August the 25
When she fell Softly and happily asleep, During the
singing the Verse Pale Lips, Kiss her upon the Heart
with the Blessing of her Choir,
in the 15 year of age
