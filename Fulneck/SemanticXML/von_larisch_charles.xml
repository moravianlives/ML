							After the remains of our dear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Larish were intred, the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							(among whom where many from London) met in the Family Hall in
							Lindsey House and then was Sung that Hymn: O Head so full of
							Bruises &amp; After which the Disciple spoke in English as follows.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							I have but a few words to say on this Occasion, the Liturgy of to
							Day belongs to the Evening when our Saviour went from us, the present Day has besides that, the particular character of all Saints, &amp; that
							gives me a handle to speak something of the Saints, &amp; of the nature of a Saint.
							&apos;Tis a name quite common in the Bible, and if we hear of a good Man
							who left the World 2, or 300 Years ago, then we have not much against
							his appearing in that Character, and are not shock&apos;d by it,
							but the Ideas we have form&apos;d to ourselves of a Saint are such, that
							in the Romish Church itself no body can be called so, till 1000
							Years after his Departure. The reason is because one fears,
							if any one should remain who had seen that Man or
							Woman he would Controul his Sanctity, he would
							say something that would lesson his Opinion of his Worthiness. I am sure one is greatly mistaken in this Respect,
							but as we are calld to promote the Sinnership we
							are not so Curious to receive that Name, Saint, we
							care not if that Charactor should be heard of no more
							but for all that I would not have it, that we shou&apos;d
							loose the meaning of the Thing together with the name
							Title &amp; Charactor, &amp; should ee prove careless in that point
							I Fear we should be deprived of a great Charactor in the Gos-
							pel Train. A Saint in my Opinion is a Christian,
							who thinks very little, who perhaps may be oblig&apos;d to

							think of many things on Account of his Business &amp; of his
							Office, but when I say he thinks not much, I mean that he
							does not care to think much, according to the Inclination
							of his Heart. You will scarcely find a Saint among the great
							Men, the Rich &amp; learn&apos;d Men, perhaps not among the Gentry, or what one calls an easy Person in this World, the reason is, because all such charge themselves with too many Superfluities, while the necessary condition of becoming
							a Saint, is not to have a great Store of Idle &amp; unnecessary things about him. Simplicity &amp; plainness is the Distinguishing, mark of a Saint. I confess that if a Person
							of that Character, happens to want Education &amp; of
							Course what one calls all manner of required Qualities
							hath absoludely not so much notion of the World, as
							to deal in an ordinary Way, in a regular Way, then the
							Sanctity of such a Man, may not comand that Honour
							that Awe, that Reverence which is due to it as long as he
							lives, &amp; it Seems therefore, that I should be afraid to tell
							you now by way of Discourse, what I have already Sung
							of my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Larish, whom I always thought a Saint &amp;
							I beleive there are 100 in the Cattalouge on Dypticks of old,
							who were by far not his paramounts, not like him, nor so
							much of a Saint as He. He was a Person void of all
							manner of Education, he had been neglected in all the
							Necessary things of this Life, &amp; after having found the 
							Secret, to make himself to be forgotten in this World, after

							having placed himself behind the Congregation at Hhuth, in
							order to lead a Simple Civil Life, &amp; absolutely not regarded by any one, which he contriv&apos;d so out of a true Humility,
							for He was a Lord, &amp; had then many Subjects, &amp; a great
							Territory of his own. When he was in that Situation
							he came hither, and met with one of the most Difficult
							Tasks which can be imagin&apos;d, nevertheless he atcheiv&apos;d &amp; performd it with such surprising Simplicity &amp; wisdom, that
							I cant help owning once more, that I should have been
							embarrass&apos;d in the highest degree to do the like: And I must add
							that if after my Decease one would compare me to that great
							Man, &amp; my Conduct to his many Personal Circumstances, as
							well as real Intricacies, which would be too long to relate
							here (the Saviour knows them, &amp; part of us are not Igorant
							thereof,) it would be mere Courtesey. B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Larish fullfill&apos;d
							his Task with Honour, &amp; has not left one leaf of his Book
							unfinish&apos;d. His end was like to that of all truly great Men, a
							little while before he had not the least thought of going home
							he was Sick, &amp; a very long time knew his sase almost incurable
							but drew no Consequence from it for in approaching Dissolution.
							When he was acquainted of the Turn his Sickness had taken
							&amp; of the approaching Dissolution, &apos;twas very well, &apos;twas
							all the same to him. Those Days passed away in the same
							Strain as the foregoing. He treated that awful matter as simple
							Natural &amp; unconcerndly fill the last gasp as usual, that
							none of the Heroes of this world, nore of the great Geniuses
							needed to be asham&apos;d of the same Exit, Considering the thing in

							itself &amp; without that difference, which makes his case so
							much happier than theirs, as for that, He will never
							change his Exit for that of any Hero of this World, of
							any great man or Philosopher whatsoever that is quite
							out of Question, all I have to say on that part is,
							that he departed this Life like a Hero.

							Every one enabled from above to see the hidden Side

							<hi rend="underline">Next follows some Account of his Life &amp; Departure</hi>
							Our dear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Henry Conrad von Parish, was born
							Sept 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> 1711 in Gradenwiz near Cosel in upper Silesia. He
							was descended from the Ancient Famous Family of the Courts
							&amp; Lords of Larish, also of the Lineage of great Nimsdorff
							<add place="above">one</add> of whom, in the Service of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> is already a grain of
						
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>
						
							Wheat in Surinam. He inherited from his parents the Lordships of Shossloehiz Lomniz Zonade &amp; Rodewiz. In his
							tender Youth he became acquainted with Abbot Steinmez &amp; other Servants of God, by means of the well known great Justness awakening, &amp; he was concern&apos;d about his Salvation very
							much, this continued for some time, &amp; on this account he staid awhile in <del>Neustad</del>
								<add place="above">Mandel</add> with Abbot Steinmetz, was at Werningrode
							Halle &amp; other Places, where he thought perhaps he might get a
							Blessing for his Heart. Since 1731 he has been acquainted
							with the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> as well in Jena as in other Places &amp; came
							from time to time to Visit the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> in Hhuth, where the
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> came ever nearer to his Heart. He found no true rest
							from all his good Performance, nor was delivered from his Anxiety till he resolv&apos;d in the Year 1739 to become the intire
							Reward of the Smart of Jesus, at the same time he got
							a Conviction to let every thing be as it was, &amp; to betake himself to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> to stay there; accordingly he did so, with
							a true Blessing for his Heart, &amp; he had at that time truely blessed times for his Heart with the Single Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> assisted also quite faithfully in Building their Choir House
							there. He was also soon received into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; partook
							of the Corps &amp; Blood of Jesus in the Sacrament with
							the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							In May 1742, He came over to Engl. were he staid for some
							time especially in Yorks<add place="above">hire</add> &amp; was edifying to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> in his
							Servants office in the Hall which he perform&apos;d very faithfully

							faithfully &amp; with his whole Heart from thence he returned in company with the Dr Disciple &amp; Mother to Holland &amp; so on to
							M-born &amp; was there May 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1743. Married to our S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Diana
							Raymond after his marriage her his Wife were 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Deacons
							in Engl &amp; conducted it with true Simplicity &amp; many Blesssings afterwards he made Several Journeys to Hhuth &amp;
							Hhaag, in this Year also he visited his Lordships &amp; found himself not only not in a Capacity to execute what he had intended, but found also such an Entanglement in his worldly
							Affairs, that he thought it best to sell his Estates, to pay
							he Debts, &amp; to give the rest to the Diaconate of the Enity
							which at that time was much streighten&apos;d, for wch in the
							Year 1740 the New House calld Lichtenburg was made over to 
							him &amp; fitted up, but because his comfort did not like to tarry
							at Hhaag, he went with her first to Zyest &amp; in the last
							Year again to Engl; &amp; enjoyed by his abode in each Place of
							those Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi> much Grace &amp; Blessings for his Heart, &amp; all
							the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> lov&apos;d him, he had a longer attachment &amp; faithful
							Heart full of love to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; his Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; amidst the various Circumstances w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> his weak constitution mostly occasi-
							ond. He was never put off from his point, but his Heart always long&apos;d after him, whom he can now see bodily &amp; kiss his
							Wounds.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							The latter Years of his mortal Life he was very Sickly &amp; had
							many disorders in his Body, but especially since the Winter
							53 yet as long as it was possible he came to the Opportunities
							in the Disciples House very diligently &amp; with great Chearfullness

					<p>
						
							cheerfulness. According to the Nature of His Disease and frequent casaulties of all sorts He thought nothing at first of going home, till just
							after his Birthday this year when the Watchword was untill the
							glance extend throughout &amp; then he came upon it very happily
							himself, and he was heard to say when by <del>by</del> himself, to our
							Saviour: My Dear Saviour be thou my all in all &amp; round about me, I am indeed weak, but thou knowest well how to make,
							it better, and he said: I am indeed spent or very weak, but I
							shall soon go into the Regions of health. Another time, when
							he was in great pain he comforted himself with the sufferings
							of our Saviour, &amp; rejorced at the sweet hour of his release, &amp;
							only wish&apos;d that our Saviour wo&apos;d take him to himself in
							sleep. As he pressd very much to have all his Temporal affairs
							concerning him and his regulated while he was here, therefore
							the Synodal Conclusion of 1753, was thro&apos; the interposition
							of the Disciples House but a few days before his end in
							the name of our God brought into the form customary
							here, and tho&apos; all the necessary forms are yet wanting from both
							the Married parties, yet the Deed is delivered to the satisfaction of all sides. Oct 26 He got a new disorder &amp; said: that now
							he was ready to waite for the last kiss, when the Brn at his
							desire sung him some verses he rejoyced and said O that
							has strengthned me, &amp; so continued in continual thought
							of going home till the 28 of Octo<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> when he said: to this Servant Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Summerskill, this Ev&apos;ning or Tomorrow
							morning the expected hour will <add place="above">come</add> &amp; often asked, is it not yet
							time he sent also 2 or 3 times in the night for B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johan

							to come and bless him, and when Joh came to him, and sung: pale
							Lips kiss him upon the Heart, he said; o yes, and to that Verse and
							when thy Mouth expiring &amp;c. He said even to Day.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							Oct 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Towards Morning he took leave of his Wife and said:
							My dear I kiss thee on thy Heart, here I have been thy Husband and thy Heart, we was both one Body but now no
							more, I an going to our dear Saviour and shall expect
							thee with my Bridegroom with Joy: Afterwards he
							said to B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Summerskill and his Wife, my dear Children forgive me every thing and I thank you for all the Love and
							faithfulness that you shew&apos;d me here and the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> will think
							on you for it, thereupon he said to his Maid (who is no
							Sister) adue I thank you also for all you have done for me, I
							wish you well in the World, about Six o&apos;Clock in the 
							Morning he desired Brother John<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> to be called
							again, because he was very weak but recover&apos;d himself as soon as he saw him w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>
							he did several times before; The rest of the
							Time he was mostly as if he was asleep, &amp; had thereby sometimes such an
							extraordinary lovely &amp; smiling look
							that the eyes of the Brethren &amp; Sisters
							round about him overflowed. Hutton
							said once, such a look is worth more

							than 100 Guineas, at last he awoke, rais&apos;d
							himself and said to Brother Johannes
							now Bless me, &amp; then he took his hand &amp;
							laid it himself upon his forehead, &amp;
							so Johannes Blessed him with that
							Verse: &amp; let his Mouth expiring on
							thy dear Breast recline &amp;c. to
							which our dear happy heart said yes
							powerfully: Ater the Blessing
							he look&apos;d about once more, when
							he saw Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Johannes, Wallerville
							Hutton &amp; others standing round
							him, he threw them a kiss, &amp; said:
							<add place="above">Fare you well</add> Adue sweetly the holy Ghost has

							the Church above made perfect
							&amp; perticularly our dear Blessed
							Christle, and he promissd it 
							with a plain Yes. His last
							Words were: We all live unto

							again and slept &amp; so according to his wish his Spirit was
							kiss&apos;d away in Sleep &amp; the Brn
							&amp; Sisters round him <add place="above">sung him</add> quite into
