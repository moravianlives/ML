					<l>The S. Sr Ann Cannings was born </l>
					<l>July 24th 1790 at Mirfield and by</l>
					<l>attending the Brns Chaple in her</l>
					<l>childhood, received an impression of the</l>
					<l>love of Jesus into her heart and became</l>
					<l>attached to the privileges of the Congn </l>
					<l>into which she was rec&apos;d March 9th 1805</l>
					<l>Two years after she was rec&apos;d moved in</l>
					<l>to the S. Srs House in Gummersal, and </l>
					<l>Jan 25th 1808 partook of the H. Comn</l>
					<l>for the first time, her fellowship</l>
					<l>with a Congn of Jesus, was much</l>
					<l>vallued by her, as her frequent impres-</l>
					<l>sions testified. She spent several years </l>
					<l>in a happy frame of mind at Gummersal </l>
					<l>but after some time a some of the </l>
					<l>despravity of her nature aimed to</l>
					<l>disturb her simple and childlike</l>
					<l>confidence in our Saviour. May 4th</l>
					<l>1811 she moved into the Choirhouse here</l>
					<l>and by her pleasing behaviour soon</l>
					<l>gained the love of the Sisters But</l>
					<l>still she often complained of not</l>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>enjoying that happiness which she felt</l>
					<l>when first impressed with our Saviours</l>
					<l>Love. Some time ago, a friend of hers</l>
					<l>found the following verses written by</l>
					<l>by her; &quot;A whither should I go, burdened</l>
					<l>and sick and faint? &amp; What is it keeps</l>
					<l>me back, from which I cannot part?&quot; &amp;</l>
					<l>This gave rise to a conversation in which </l>
					<l>she complained with many tears of </l>
					<l>the state of her heart, and confessed</l>
					<l>that she was engaged with thoughts</l>
					<l>and actions contrary to the mind of</l>
					<l>the Lord. She was then directed with </l>
					<l>all her ailments to Jesus the good</l>
					<l>Physicion, sought his pardning grace</l>
					<l>and obtained a reviving sence of his</l>
					<l>mercy. The celebration of the Passion</l>
					<l>week this year was remarkably blessed</l>
					<l>to her, and she expressed herself concer-</l>
					<l>ning it, to the following effect:</l>
					<l>&quot;Oh how shall I describe my feelings,</l>
					<l>the Power of Jesus blood and death</l>
					<l>pervaded my soul in a manner, which</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>I shall never forget, in his pierced hands</l>
					<l>I read my pardon seated, he is mine</l>
					<l>and I am his, oh might nothing ever</l>
					<l>separate me from him!&quot;-- She was</l>
					<l>naturally of a weakly constitution, and</l>
					<l>therefore often thought, that her pil-</l>
					<l>grimage on earth might not be long.</l>
					<l>In the latter end of May last she was</l>
					<l>obliged to move into the sickroom, and </l>
					<l>growing no better, went to her parents</l>
					<l>house to Mirfield to be nursed by them.</l>
					<l>Her complaint appeared consumptive,</l>
					<l>she grew rapidly worse, and tho&apos; she</l>
					<l>did not immidiately suppose her de-</l>
					<l>parture to be so near at hand, felt</l>
					<l>soon resigned to our Saviours will</l>
					<l>declared that thro&apos; the merits of</l>
					<l>Jesus, her mind was at peace, begged</l>
					<l>her parents not to grieve, and had a</l>
					<l>lively hope of appearing in our Saviours</l>
					<l>presence, as a pardened sinner, This</l>
					<l>favour was granted to her Sept 3 1813</l>
					<l>in the 24th year of her age.</l>
