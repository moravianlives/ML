					<lb />and was Supriseingly struck with his Heavenly Mien
					<lb />and thought surely that is a Man of God, beleiveing He
					<lb />was one of the so calld Breth<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> belonging to the people at
					<lb />fulenneck, this made such an Impression on her Heart
					<lb />and from that Hour she felt a real Compunction &amp; desire
					<lb />that she might Once belong to that people, for she
					<lb />certainly beleive<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> them to be the Children of God
					<lb />She then resolved to leave that place &amp; return unto
					<lb />her Mother at Holm in Order to be nearer the Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
					<lb />that she Might injoy the Oppertunities of hearing
					<lb />The Gosple preach<hi rend="superscript">d</hi></p>
					<p>
					<lb />from That time she was sensibly
					<lb />convince<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> that it was our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> who had so powerfully
					<lb />opperated upon her Heart, &amp; Meeting with no Objections
					<lb />she hasten<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> as much as possable to accomplish her
					<lb />desire &amp; call.</p>
					<p>
					<lb />The dear Mother thee Holy Ghost work<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
					<lb />powerfully on her Heart, &amp; soon let her feel the need
					<lb />she had of a Redeemer, which made her Cry what
					<lb />shall I do to be Save<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi></p>

					<lb />Her Sistr spoak words of comfort to her &amp; in a little
					<lb />time after she was receivd into the Society.</p>
					<p>
					<lb />The desire of her heart daily increase to be in a nearer
					<lb />&amp; closer Connection with the S Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> &amp; she wish<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> much to be
					<lb />taken into the Oeconomie but as there was no room her
					<lb />request cou<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not be Granted at that Time, but on March 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 
					<lb />1762 she went to live with some young women belonging the
					<lb />Society, were she still kept faithfull to her first call &amp;
					<lb />constant attentiveness to the teachings of the dear Mother
					<lb />under whose bless<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> <unclear>Man eduction</unclear> she was soon brought to
					<lb />be acquainted with her dear Mayrt<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Spouse</p>
					<p>
					<lb />Her longing desire much increased after that wish<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> for Grace
					<lb />of becoming Once a Member of the dear congregation &amp;
					<lb />wou<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> often Sigh &amp; say I can hardly beleive such a favour will
					<lb />be granted me I&apos;m such an unworthy Creature, but however in
					<lb />real Confidence of My dear Lamb I will still beg for it &amp;
					<lb />On the 13 of Nov the same year her Earnest longing desire
					<lb />was Granted, to her Supriseing joy &amp; abasement, for this
					<lb />Great Grace, the thro&apos; pirced feet of her faithfull
					<lb />lover got many a Magdelen Salute.</p>
					<p>
					<lb />Dec<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> 18 the same year the Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Moveing into their new choir
					<lb />house at Gracehill it Cause<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> her much Smart she not haveing
					<lb />leave at that some to go with them, but went with some other
					<lb />Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> to to live in the Oeconomie at Pudsey, were she began
					<lb />to grow some what unfaithfull to her kind teacher, by
					<lb />which Means she brought herself into a reasoning way
					<lb />which Cause<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> her some unhappy hours.</p>
					<p>
					<lb />But our dear Saviour out of love &amp; Mercy drew near
					<lb />to her poor heart again &amp; in a consumeing Manner gave
						<lb /><note type="catchword">her</note>

					<lb />her to feel that she was care<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of from that blessd point
					<lb />which wou<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>  <unclear>??? ????</unclear> in all <unclear>?????</unclear> of heart &amp; mind
					<lb />&amp; felt that she <unclear>???</unclear> now as a poor sinner afresh on his
					<lb />Grace &amp; Mercy which she did, and said I know that he loves me
					<lb />&amp; is my best &amp; kindest friend &amp; I am Much ashamed that I have
					<lb />kept so long at a distance from him Oh he his my poor
					<lb />souls lover &amp; I must have a nearer connection with his
					<lb />dear bleeding Heart or I cannot subsist. She now began
					<lb />to be very serious &amp; thoughtfull about the Lord Supper
					<lb />Her heart longd &amp; panted Much after the precious Corpse &amp;
					<lb />blood of her dearest Jesus, on account which she Earnestly
					<lb />desired to be remember<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> by Sis<hi rend="superscript">tr</hi> Mary who faithfully thought

					<lb />it is My right habittation. I know My Lamb has call<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> me to 
					<lb />belong thereto. &amp; on Nov the same year she had the
					<lb />Grace &amp; favour to become an inhabitant of the same
					<lb />to her great joy &amp; consolation.</p>
					<p>
					<lb />in the Spring of the year 55 she got a cough &amp; a swelling
					<lb />in her neck, attend<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> with much pain, she did not think this
					<lb />woud prove the Ocasion of bringing her to her Eternal rest
					<lb />at that time, she use<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Some Means and soon grew better
