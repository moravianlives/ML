					<l>I was born in holbeck in the parish of Leeds in the year of our</l>
					<l>Lord 1717 May ye 18 of very dear &amp; tender parrents who were</l>
					<l>prebytouryons but I was baptiz&apos;d by a Minister of the Church</l>
					<l>of England on account of their thinking of my soon departing</l>
					<l>this life Else I was educated in the Religion of the presbytierens</l>
					<l>When I was a little Child and my mother Dressing of me</l>
					<l>She generaly told me I was now going amongst other Children</l>
					<l>to play, and I should perhaps hear them say bad words</l>
					<l>and Charg&apos;d me to take care I did not so, for it was a bad thing</l>
					<l>and this had such an Impression on my mind that It never</l>
					<l>left me, no not when I was amongst the Children, but always</l>
					<l>remain&apos;d in my mind that it was such a bad thing to do so </l>
					<l>from 7 years old I often went into a Corner to pray, that god</l>
					<l>would have Mercy on me and often wept before him, when I </l>
					<l>had the Smallpox it was thought by every one who Saw me</l>
					<l>that I should have gone home, then being but 7 years old, but</l>
					<l>my mother on her knees often pray&apos;d the Lord to Spare my Life</l>
					<l>howsoever I might be disfigur&apos;d with them I used to ask my</l>
					<l>mother what one might do to be Saved, and she told me I must</l>
					<l>pray to the Lord and beleive on him and I should be Saved</l>
					<l>and I asked her if one could not be sure she said no she beleiv&apos;d</l>
					<l>not, but one must pray to him and beleive in him in my young</l>
					<l>years I came into Several dangers of my Life Especially once</l>
					<l>when I was drawing water at a deep Well, the Roulor which </l>
					<l>winds up the Rope came out of the frame, and it with the Swape</l>
					<l>went all into the well and pulled me on to my knees after it</l>
					<l>I Liv&apos;d Still with my parrents in a private manner kept no </l>
					<l>Company and at nights when work was done I used to go into the </l>
					<l>feilds and pray that ye Lord would have Mercy on me, I often</l>
					<l>Sigh&apos;d &amp; thought O that I was sure of my Salvation till I was</l>
					<l>about fourteen years of age Some neighbour Girls about that</l>
					<l>time was throng in gotting fine Cloaths I also fell in with them</l>

					<l>with great eagerness I tought now I will have some pleasure</l>
					<l>of my Life Living a Religious Life &amp; takeing care as much as</l>
					<l>possible to avoid every thing that was bad thinking I might</l>
					<l>by that means injoy some pleasure of my Life and go to heaven</l>
					<l>as others did before I was sixteen years of age I met with a young</l>
					<l>man who told me, he had pitch&apos;d on me for his wife, I told him</l>
					<l>I was too young, he told me he would wait till I was older I </l>
					<l>found my self thereby drawn in to something, which when my</l>
					<l>dear &amp; tender parrents as well as my Sister <add place="above">heaped of </add>they did all in their</l>
					<l>power to brake it off out of tender love to me this greiv&apos;d &amp; troubld</l>
					<l>me very much for some years I could not got it out of my mind, nor</l>
					<l>could I take any pleasure in any thing as before I had many good</l>
					<l>offers but being disapointed once it set me quite against it when</l>
					<l>I had gone now some years in this disatisfied Condition I heard</l>
					<l>that Mr Ingham was going about to preach the Gospel, I went</l>
					<l>to hear him, and he preach&apos;d concerning the forgiveness of sins</l>
					<l>which was so much to me that it directly eas&apos;d me of all my</l>
					<l>former trouble &amp; uneasiness I came home weeping all the way</l>
					<l>for 3 mile which I had never gone before nor did I know the way</l>
					<l>till then my Dear parrents were much affected seeing me in such</l>
					<l>a weeping Condidition I pray&apos;d our Saviour to give me my parrents</l>
					<l>and the whole Family, which he did directly, I went to the meetings</l>
					<l>and often wept after the forgiveness of my sins &amp; the full assurance</l>
					<l>of it in my heart it was often to me in the midst of my prayers</l>
					<l>as if the Person above mention&apos;d stood before me &amp; I was praying</l>
					<l>to him this troubl&apos;d me very much I strove &amp; pray&apos;d with weeping</l>
					<l>to get him out of my mind at Last I turn&apos;d to our Saviour &amp;</l>
					<l>with great Egarness &amp; said to him Lord Jesus thou canst help me</l>
					<l>take this away from me which hinders me from seeking thy rich</l>
					<l>forgiveness for the sake of which I wou&apos;d part with every thing</l>
					<l>else I found he did help me and took it quite away where upon</l>
					<l>I thought he can do all things for me being Sure I could no</l>

					<l>by no <add place="above">other</add> means have got rid of them I pray&apos;d heartily to him, for the</l>
					<l>full asurance of the forgiveness of all my sins, which I could no</l>
					<l>Longer be satisfied about, at the same time hardly knowing what</l>
					<l>I wanted forgiving, but at once it came into my mind, that I had</l>
					<l>never Lov&apos;d God in my Life from thence flow&apos;d all my sins which</l>
					<l>I ever had done or said, then I went on mourning night &amp; day</l>
					<l>thinking I must be Lost, &amp; wishing myself any sort of creature</l>
					<l>but what I was, I work&apos;d at the same time among a company of 8</l>
					<l>or 10 very wicked people in a shop, who spent their time in Singing</l>
					<l>songs or Swearing the day long, while I sat weeping &amp; praying</l>
					<l>they thinking that I to be sure was going of my Senses, at that</l>
					<l>time in the midst of all this company, it was to me as if I saw our</l>
					<l>Saviour Cover&apos;d all over with Blood &amp; wounds, standing before me</l>
					<l>who told me that he had dy&apos;d for me &amp; received all those wounds</l>
					<l>in his Sacred Body on my account, my heart was filld with rapture</l>
					<l>&amp; I wish&apos;d that the whole world coul&apos;d Join with me, to praise him</l>
					<l>I went a qarter of year without ever losing this impression, and</l>
					<l>feeling I then got, after this I begun to feel my self very poor, and</l>
					<l>left that feeling of Joy which I had, this Causd me to mourn, &amp; think</l>
					<l>what I had grow&apos;d my dear Lord with about this time dear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bohler</l>
					<l>came into those parts who preach&apos;d our dear Saviours death &amp; wounds more</l>
					<l>clear then ever I had heard before, by this I learn&apos;d to know that I should</l>
					<l>remain poor and Low in my self, &amp; go to him in his wounds &amp; Blood</l>
					<l>Just as I was, then I begaun to reason over myself that I had not known</l>
					<l>his wounds &amp; blood aright, &amp; could not be satisfied about till I had</l>
					<l>Learn&apos;d to know them better so I wept and pray&apos;d so long before </l>
					<l>him till he again satisfied my poor heart, &amp; afresh let me feel</l>
					<l>the power of his wounds and Blood here upon I ask&apos;d my dear parrents</l>
					<l>to forgive me every thing where with I had grow&apos;d them &amp; thank&apos;d them</l>
					<l>at the same time for Learning me to read which struck them very</l>
					<l>much but I was glad to read the scriptures which were a very great</l>
					<l>comfort to me, &amp; the dear Holy ghost pointed out to me thro them</l>
					<l>How I should go on, When I heard of the Brns Settling in yorkshire </l>

					<l>my heart was very much rejoiced B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dicky Uttly spoke to me</l>
					<l>about writing to the Congregation for reception but I thought</l>
					<l>my self too poor &amp; mean to think of such a favour but I thought</l>
					<l>if it was our Saviours will y he had Calld me I wou&apos;d write to</l>
					<l>the Congregation in his name which I accordingly did and</l>
					<l>was re&apos;d on Christmas day old Stile the impression I then</l>
					<l>got continu&apos;d with me wherever I went of I was as if the spirit</l>
					<l>of the Congregation rested upon me, and I went on happilly till</l>
					<l>the next communion day, when I <add place="above">was</add> admitted Candidate, what I then</l>
					<l>felt I shall never forgot, tho it is beyond description to describe</l>
					<l>the feeling of my heart on that Ocassion the next time</l>
					<l>I injoy&apos;d the Communion with the Congregation, to my deepest abasement</l>
					<l>for the first time to are abiding Blessing &amp; Comfort to my poor</l>
					<l>heart, I Lived still with my dear Parrents at Holbeck &amp; being</l>
					<l>of a Sickly constitution, &amp; timrous Disposition, often came with </l>
					<l>difficulty&apos;s, to my dear fullneck, but my dear &amp; faithfull</l>
					<l>Saviour graciously preserved &amp; help&apos;d me thro all, till at last</l>
					<l>being not able to walk so far I with my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> mov&apos;d into Pudsey</l>
					<l>While I remain&apos;d in holbeck it was my greatest pleasure with my</l>
					<l>Dear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to Entertain the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; Sisters who came to the</l>
					<l>Soceity meetings kept then at our House &amp; as far as laid in</l>
					<l>my power to serve them since I have removd to pudsey I have</l>
					<l>injoy&apos;d more of the Congregation meeting to a real Blessing</l>
					<l>for my heart for which and all other favours rece&apos;d by me</l>
					<l>from him &amp; his dear Congregation I am truly thankfull</l>
