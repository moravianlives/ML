						unprofitable company, so that at last it became quite indifferent to me, whether I went to any place of worship or not as my acquintance cared for the expense, &amp; I began to
						consider myself as my own master, I paid no regard to any admonitions, that were given me, but I thought I had met with a very good Companion. My master in particular used to
						tell me, that he hoped I should See the time, when I should <add place="above">think</add> him not my friend, but I treated this observation with disregard &amp; slighted what
						he said, because he was a methodist. When I was loose from my Master, having lived with him 7 Years, I continued to go in in my old course, keeping company with my friend (as I

I made a promise at that time,
						that if ever I got better again, I would forsake my wicked ways &amp; turn as a poor Sinner to our <roleName type="honorific">Savior</roleName>, but alas when <name health="recovered">I got well again</name>, I went in as before, forgot entirely my promise, &amp; associated again with my former hurtful Companion. </p>

					<p> my <name relation="sister">Sister</name> who belonged to the <orgName en="congregation">B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> was much
						grieved about me, and tried to persuade me be attend the <name event="religious">preaching</name> at <placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName>, when she went thither. I
						went once with her on a Sunday in the afternoon, when I heard the late <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.</roleName>
						<persName>John Miller</persName> ??? read some accounts concerning the <orgName en="congregation">Indian Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> in <placeName>North
							America</placeName>, &amp; afterwards keep a Discourse. I was struck at hearing how much sooner the poor <name type="Indigenous">Indians</name> were brought to the
						Knowledge of our <roleName type="honorific">Savior</roleName> than such a wicked man as myself. <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
							Miller</persName> came down after to see my <name relation="sister">Sister</name> &amp; as I was at work in the same room he addressed himself to me, &amp; after speaking
						in a friendly way with me he invited me to call &amp; I see him. I went down after, &amp; made known to him my desire to join the <orgName>Brn</orgName> &amp; soon after I was
							<name event="reception">received</name> into the <orgName>Society</orgName>, &amp; became acquainted with the <name office="labourer">Sing B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi>
							Labourer</name>, &amp; used to spend the time between the meetings in the <placeName>S. B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> house</placeName>: I little expected then, that I
						should once come &amp; live in it as I considered it to be too high a favor for such a great Sinner, as I then felt myself to be; I got leave also to come to the <name event="religious">Choir meetings</name> on Sunday mornings, which was a <name type="emotion">real blessing to me</name>. <date when-iso="1790-03-29">March 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1790</date> I came to live in the <placeName>B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> house</placeName>; &amp; it being the passion Week I attended
						the meetings, which made an <name type="emotion">abiding impression upon my heart</name>. <date when-iso="1791-12-14">Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 14 1791</date> I got

						<name type="emotion">to my great Joy</name>, &amp; on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> I was <name event="reception">received</name>

						to lead me on to the end, poor &amp; needy as I am.</p>
					<p> Thus far our late <roleName type="honorific">Brothers</roleName> our account of himself.</p>
					<p>
						<date when-iso="1772-06-02">June 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1772</date> he was <name office="spectator">Spectator</name> at the <name event="communion">holy

					</p>
					<cb></cb>
					<p> he partook with us of the <name event="communion">Comunion</name>. For some years past <name health="disease">he has been sickly</name>, &amp; in <date when-iso="1793-03">march
							last</date>, it appeared as if his <name health="disease">complaint would terminate in a Consumption</name>: his <name office="labourer">Laborer</name> adds concerning him:
						He was a <roleName type="honorific">Brother</roleName> of few words, but the feeling attending what he said, as well as the earnest desire, which he often expressed during his
							<name health="disease">Sickness</name> to go to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>, showed clearly, that <name type="emotion">he
							loved him</name>: being once asked, whether he thought he should see the beginning of an other year? his answer was: no our <roleName type="honorific">Savior</roleName> has
						made it clear to me, that I shall go before the next <name event="communion">Comunion</name>. He departed gently &amp; happily <date type="death" when-iso="1796-12-05">dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1796</date> &amp; is now at rest.</p>
					<p> In some papers found after his departure, he writes under <date when-iso="1791-11-13">Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1791</date>. <name type="emotion">This was a very blessed day to my <add place="above">poor</add> soul</name> our <roleName type="honorific">Savior</roleName> let me see what a thoroughly
						depraved &amp; Spoiled Creature I am &amp; that without him I am nothing but Sin &amp; misery, but thanks he to his name for the blessings, which I receive from him from time
						to time: <date when-iso="1792-08-29">aug 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1792</date> I partook of the <name event="communion">Holy Comunion</name> for the first time: I cannot
						express in Words, what a nearness of our <roleName type="honorific">Savior</roleName>'s love to poor Sinners I then experienced. I began the <date when-iso="1793">year
							1793</date> trusting in our <roleName type="honorific">Savior</roleName>'s merits, &amp; praying him to keep me ever in remembrance of his death &amp; sufferings
						endured on my account a poor Sinner, thanking him likewise for the many favors &amp; blessings I had received at his hand in the year past. <date when-iso="1793-08-27">aug 27
							1793</date> (being his birth day) now I begin an other year: O <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>, be near to me, &amp; let me have thee in my mind both day &amp;
						night, I pray. </p>
