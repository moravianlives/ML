					The Course of Life of the Great Girl Hannah Hunt
					I was born in Gomersal in the parish of Birstol in
					the year 1755, removed with my parents to
					Fulneck 1760, by which means I had the opportunity
					of going to the Childrens meeting which was a
					great favoar to me &amp; also a Great satisfaction
					to my dear parents when I behaved orderly and
					well, but alass it was too <add place="above">much</add>
						<del>often</del> the case otherwise
					my Lightmindedness often deprived me of the
					injoyment of the congregation Days which was
					at Times a real mortification to me &amp; made me
					examine myself more sollomly then I surely
					should have done, had I been sufferd to go on
					with out reprose,
				</p>
			<p>
					March 25 by I was received into the great girls choir
					from which Time I became more thoughtful over the
					miss spent time in My Childrens years, &amp; wishd to conduct
					myself for the future more to my saviours mind,
					which occasion'd an Earnest desire in me to live amongst
					the Girls in the Choirhouse into which place I had
					the Grace to enter the following month of august
					with a real desire to devote soul &amp; body to live to my dear
					Saviour, beging Him to forgive me all my former disobedience
					&amp; make me a true poor sinner according to His own Heart
					but after all my Good resolutions, I had not the Grace to be
					open Hearted nither to my Labourers nor room companions
					so that I came into a real dryness &amp; indifferece of Heart to 
					the Calls of Grace &amp; also the blessing I might have injoyd
					amongest the dear Girls, who as well as the Sisters, felt
					great pain &amp; concern over my poor Salvation; which brought
					me upon more serious reflection &amp; I began to be more incurably 
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_16HuntHannah-02.jpg" n="2" />
			<p>
				
					convinced of the great danger I was in, so that I became
					very Heavy &amp; much disstresst &amp; seeing one and another
					of my room companions received into the congregation
					I was brought by such occasions to look afresh into
					my own Heart &amp; beg with the Tenderest Tears of my
					dear saviour what He wou'd bless me &amp; make <add place="above">help</add> me <add place="above">to be</add> more
					open Hearted then Hitherto, for I now felt more than I was
					able to bear, &amp; I felt the Grace &amp; confidence that He
					wou'd look upon me His poor child --
				</p>
			<p>
					March 27 1769 I was received into the congregation 
					which was a great blessing &amp; merited the Tenderest &amp; most
					Humble adoration my poor Heart was able to return' thus
					fare or own words.
				</p>
			<p>
					from This Time was Observed a particular work
					of the Holy ghost. Her close &amp; reserved disposition had
					caused Her Laborers many uneasey hours as no
					Traces of Thankfulness, cou'd be preceived Either for
					Her liveing in the choirhouse or the care &amp; nursing
					bestowd upon or that she injoy'd ought pleasing
					in the fellowship amongest the girls, she now became
					more freindly &amp; open Hearted &amp; spok in a sinnerlike
					&amp; blessed manner over Her whole course &amp; going
					on, &amp; that Her present Sickness was a real blessing
					to Her, it being a slow wearing, which gave Her an
					oppertunity of seeing several depart out of this Time
					dureing Her abode in the sickroom which caused Her
					many Tears, Especial one of Her room Girls namely
					anna Joh<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> Gambold, whose corpses she beg'd to have brought 
					to Her bedside before she was carried out, of the sickroom
					Ah <add place="above">she</add> cryd when will my Happy hour come, I used I cou'd not
					bear the thought of dieing, but now all that Timouressness
					is departed from me &amp; I can Heartily wish My Saviour wou'd
					take me to Himself, being one day observd weep in silence
				
			</p>
			<p>
				
					<add place="above">and</add> askd The occasion she answerd I was reflecting How
					blind I shou'd be if my dr savr wou'd permitt me to be a candidate
					but my weakly Tabernacle cannot be present at any such
					oppertunity; but pray think of me, she was disired not
					to make it Heavy to Herself but wait satisfied our d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
					Time &amp; love &amp; long for Him with Her whole Heart;
				</p>
			<p>
					On July 10 she was acquainted that our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> had granted
					Her request in being candidate for the Holy communion <add place="above">&amp; also a participant</add>
					she burst into a flood of Tears &amp; Expressd much love and
					Tenderness to Her dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> for bestowing such Grace
					upon so worthless a Creature as she was, &amp; said I have
					often spoke &amp; Heard it spoke about the sinnership
					but I never knew in all my Life what is was to feel
					it in my Heart till I came upon my sickbed, indeed; its
					quite a different thing to feel it then only to say I am a
					sinner I will and shoud be a sinner, thanks be to my dr
					Lamb who has given me the Grace to feel thus Happy a
					midn all poverty &amp; weakness; &amp; askd if she might
					communicate this the knowledge of this favour she
					had to be a candidate &amp; <add place="above">a participant to</add> Her sick companions who
					Heartily rejoiced with Her, &amp; waitd with impatience the
					Happy moment of this great injoyment; &amp; dureing the
					Sacrament which she &amp; another of Her sick companion
					injoyd for the firt Time, there was an inexpresable
					feeling of the nearness of her unseen freind, whom Her
					longing spirit wish soon for to Embrace, &amp; she continued
					in a Joyful Expectation of seeing Him face to face who
					had thus Sacrementaly prepared Her for His arms &amp; bosom
					in the Midst of the Knowledge of Her own poverty and
					wretchedness she as attain'd thro' grace in His merits
					to close Her period in this Time during the blessing of 
					Her choir &amp; Enterd into Her Eternal rest July 20 1769
					&amp; in the 14 year of Her age,
