Our late Sr. (Elizth Shawe) was
born at Pudsey Augt. 13 / 74 &
was baptized in the Church of England. Neither
of her parents was at that time in
connection with the Brn our church, but
her mother afterwards joined us, 
& departed this life happily in our
Widows house in the yr. 1834
Our late Sister went, when she
was 13 years old, to live in the Sis
ters house at that time existing
at Littlemoor; & while residing
these was recd into the church &
admitted  to the H. Comn. & recd it was no
doubt, in those early days, that she first felt
deep impressions of religious truth
& recd that good seed into her heart which afterwards
sprang up & yielded good fruit. When
the establishmt, at Littlemoor was
broken up, she removed to our Sis
ters' house here; about the yr. 1800
she entered into the service of the late
Br John Hartley at that time Labourer mi
nister of this Congn & accompanied
them when they removed twice, first to Dub
lin & then to Gracehill in Ireland.
After the happy departure of her ex
cellent & beloved master, to whose
faithful & blessed ministry & friend
ly counsel she owed much (in the
yr. 1811) returned with Sr Hart
ley to Fulnec & entered our Sisters'


house again. She was much attach
ed to the dr. family with which she had lived so long; & the only survi
vor of that family Sr. Hartley of going old any ??? speaks of her in
very affectionate terms. She was
then enjoyed, for a long series of
years, no less than 34, partly as su
peritendent of the wash & partly
as cook, in our Sisters' house un
til increasing infirmity obliged
her to retire altogether in yr. 1845.
She manifested exemplary faith
fulness in every service in which she
engaged, & was truly & deeply inter
rested in the welfare, spiritual
and temporal, of the choir house & of all
its inhabitants; moreover she always
showed much regard & sympathy for the Sisters
placed of the head of the Institu
tion. She had long been afflicted
with a that very painful complaint,
a cancer, & suffered much
from it; nor is it to be wondered
at, that she sometimes felt very
much cast down from a fear lest that
her life sh would be long protracted & her suffer
ings become more & more acute.
These circumstances will account
for her occasionally appearing some
what quarelous & over-anxious.
Yet she was, as both her conduct
& conversation proved, a true belie
ver, a lover the L. J. Christ. His grace


enabling her to show her faith by her
wants & in her spirit, as is proved
by what is said above as to her conduct
in the various situations she occupied.
During her last illness she grew per
ceptibly in grace; her views of Christian
truth were clear & very correct; she 
lived in communn with her Savr &
in dependence on His grace. It was 
her delight to be visited by Christian friends those
who would converse with her on spiri
tual subjects, & these visits were
edifying & cheering to those who paid
them as her Labourer & minister
can especially testify. She was truly
humble & renounced all seft-righte
ousness, looking to Christ alone for
wisdom & righteousness sanctifi
cation & redemption; & tho' she never
spoke in the language of strong assurance,
she expressed a hope, humble indeed, but confident that
humble that our Savr would finish
& perfect His work in her, her con
stant prayer being, "O that He would
make me ready for His kingdom."
Being once reminded of the num
ber, variety & explicitness of grace the pro
mises which all are all yea in Christ, 
& in Him Anew, to those, who
like her, felt their utter unworthi
ness & lost state without a Savr, she
replied. "yes, they are exceeding great
& they are precious to me, & I hope


I has an interest in them; but He
says He will by inquired of for these
things & I hope sometimes fear I am not truthful
in asking." Two days before her end,
she said to her Labourer, "I continually
call on my Lord to help me!" & then
prayed aloud: "Prepare me for Thy
coming O Lord! Thou knowest better
than I do what I still want to make
me ready!" She afterwards said,
"My soul is very precious to my Savr."
yes, replied her ??? for He has redeemed
it with his precious blood." She then
said: "O yes! & I know that my
Redeemer liveth."
At the beginning of last week she
grew rapidly worse & perceptibly
weaker, & suffered greatly especially
from tightness in chest. On Thursday even
ing between 4 & 5 Br. & Sr. Rogers called to see her,
without supposing that her
dissolution was at hand. On seeing
her, however, the former proposed im
parting the last blessing to her as she
was evidently sinking fast. He first
spoke asked her a few questions, 
"Do you feel yr Savr near you? to
which she distinctly answered "Yes!"
She afterwards uttered some short
sentences, which were however, quite
unintelligible, & then said dis
tinctly "But I cannot speak!" &
these were the last words she uttered.
After singing a few verses, etc: He com
mended her departing spirit to that


Redeemer whom she believed, knew &
fully trusted, & then pronounced
the O.T. blessing over her. She had
altered perceptibly during this so
lemnity, which was marked by a 
powerful feeling of the peace of God Jesus peace, &
nor 2 minutes after the last
words were pronounced, her heart
ceased to beat & her ransomed &
happy spirit fled to her Saviour's
arms. Her age was 74 years & 3
months.
