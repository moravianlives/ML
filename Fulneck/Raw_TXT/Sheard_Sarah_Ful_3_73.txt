The Life of the Single Sistr Sarh Sheard who went home to
Our Saviour Aug 5 1773 of which She has dictated the following
I was born at Birstal Jany 15 1741 and Baptizd in the Church
of England. By means of the Brns Preaching in my Fathers House
I had the Oportunity of hearing the Gospel from my Earliest
Infancy and got a particular love and Esteem for the Childns
Meetings which I frequented
In July 1752 I was at Fulneck, at a Baptism kept by the
Late Br Cennick, the Hall being very much Crowded, I
cou'd not See the Br but was so affected by the Discourse
that I cou'd not forbear weeping all the time soon after I had
the favour to be at the Childns Congn Day at Fallneck, and
being with other of the Country. Childn as Spoctator in the Galory
During the Prostration The sight together with the feeling of
Our Savrs nearness overcame me in such a Manner as I am not
able to describe, The next time I had the Grace to be at
The Prostration with the Childn in the Hall which was a
peculiar Blessed day to me wherein our Savr Manifested
Himself to me asuring me that he had forgiven me every thing
my heart was thereby so melted that my eyes overflowed
with many gratefull tears before Him thro, tho inexpresible
feeling of His Love and grace
In 1753 I had the small Pox, and was thereby brought very
weak, I Long'd very much to go to our Savr and was pleasd
with nothing but hearing Verses Concerning that Subject which
my Eldest Br who was also sick together with my Sistr
very agreably entertained me with Singing, But as this was not
the time for my happy Departure I in Process of time
recover'd again
Thus far Our Late Sistr


It was Perceptible in This Our Sistr from Her Infancy that
Our Savr kept His Hand over Her as His Own peculiar
Property, as She cou'd injoy Satisfaction in nothing but the
feeling Since of His nearness On which account Her natural
anxious and reserv'd turn made her time somewhat heavy.
to Her till she Obtaind a Settled Peace and Satisfaction
in Our Savr Thro' the allsufficientcy of His Merits
She Earnestly desird the Fellowship of the Sistrs and was rejoiced
when any came to See Her Or when she had the Opportunity
of seeingthem at Fullneck, Where the meetings & Classes of the
Sistrs was a great refreshment to Her
May 4 1760 she was reced into the Sistrs Choir to a
real Blessing for Her heart, and Aug 9 following She
obtain'd leave to move into the Choir House at Fallneck
to Her great Joy Her course was in general very Still
but it was Evident that Our Savr led her more into
the true knowlege of Her own Poverty Whereby Her Heart
became more atachd to His Dr Person as Her only object
She had the Grace to love and be belov'd by Her Sistrs
as a true poor Sinner
Septr 29 1760 She was recd into the Congn Soon after
which time Her long and tedious Illness began by a fitt
of the Ague Which the scarcely recoverd before by means
of a fall She hurt Her Hand Which could her great
Pain all possible means were usd but to little purpose
as Her Disorder Settled in it and became a perpetual
Wound which in time renderd it useless
April 19 1761 She had the grace to be a Particpant
of


The H Comn to Her inexpressible Joy and Consolation
Her Sickly Habit of Body causd Her many Painfull Sensations
Wherein our Savr alone cou'd comfort Her and it was
amazing to See how patiently she bore it and how willing
She was bejond her ability to help Herself by working at
Her Needle During Her abode in the Sickroom of which
She became an inhabitant in 1769 this provd a real Schooling
time to Her heart Wherein she became more thoroughly aqainted
with Her self as a poor Sinner that wanted real Grace and
comfort from Our Savr Who from time to time Supported
her Thro' His Nearness
About 6 weeks before other removal from us She expressed
a desire to Vissit Her Parrents, Her desire was granted
in Order by Change of Air and Exercise of the Journey
to refresh Her and upon Her return it Seemd as if
it  Had been of Service to Her But it ^did not hold long
before She grew worse Upon ^which Considering herself as a Burdensome
Person to the Choir and likely to remain so much Longor She
came to a Resolution to move to Her Parrents in Consequence
of this She remov'd Octbr 16 1772 The Choir who hitherto
Had Supported Her Continuing their Bounty towards Her in
the Same Manner as when Present She spent Her time with
Her Parronts happily and was able to ride to Gumersall Nov 29
to the H Comn which was a great refroshmont to Her. But
from that time she could go out no more by reason of great
Weakness. In Jany 1773 Her Disordor seizd Her more Violent
Then ever in Her Back as well as Hand  of which Several
Bones were taken this causd Her many Sleeploss Nights wherein
She lookd out with Longing for Her release. When sometimes
She grew a little Impatient and thereby thought she had growd


Her Mother She cou'd not rest till she was reconcild again
Which causd many tender Emotions on both Sides
Her greatest Pleasure was to hear of, or See, any of the Sistrs
Who Visited Her Frequently which always provd a great refreshmont
to Her. But Particularly The H Comn which she injoyd Several
times on Her Sick Bed, Provd a real Comfort and Consolation
to Her, at which times a peculiar feeling of our Savrs near
noss was perceptible to all Present,
June 14 She got a Violent Cough with Spitting & Purging,
this weakened Her much, Her Heart rejoiced to think our
Savr woud Soon take Her, and on the Sunday following, She
Desird Her Parrents & Sistr breakfast with Her which they
did; Saying Perhaps by next Sunday I shall be with Our Savr
soon after Her Choir Labross Visited Her again for the last
time and Spoke thoroughly with Her concerning many things
to Her great Satisfaction, after which she spent Her time in
a Sinnorlike Happy Converse with our Savr till Aug 2

in Hope that all Her Sorrow wou'd Shortly have an end
Which accordingly Happen'd on the 5 inst, when about 4 o Clock
in the' Morning it was Evident that Her Disolution was near
Her Speech failing She coud not say much, but expressd I want
and being askd, is it our Savr you want, She replyd
O yes that is the thing, the Chief thing then all will be
made Good; Those were Her last words after which
She lay verry Still till 8 oClock when She full Softly
and Happilly asleep, During a Sweet Liturgy
in the 33 year of Her Age
