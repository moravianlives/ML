      <lb/>The Course of life of the S. Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi> Hannah Taylor
      <lb/>She was Born Feb 16. 1740. at Wyke &amp; brought up by her
      <lb/>Parents, who sent Her to one of the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> Schools, viz to Martha
      <lb/>Haley, where she enjoy'd the Childrens Meetings to a blessing
      <lb/>for her Heart, being of a pensive turn caus'd her often even
      <lb/>while Young, very Serious reflections concerning herself, in
      <lb/>which case She turn'd to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">.r</hi> &amp; found in him her only
      <lb/>Comfort. In the Y<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 1767. She went to live with B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp;
      <lb/>Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Zander, &amp; seved them with all faithfulness, till S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Zander
      <lb/>went home, when She Obtain'd permission to move the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>
      <lb/>Oeconomy at Gumersal, Her She soon gain'd the Love of the
      <lb/>S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>, but her natural reserved Dissposition caus'd her &amp; others
      <lb/>Some pain in the begining, which however soon wore of,
      <lb/>as she got more freedom &amp; could confidently speak her hearts
      <lb/>Situation Just as it was! It was very perceptable that the
      <lb/>holy Ghost led Her into a deeper Knowledge of her own 
      <lb/>depravity, which together with her Natural Timours mind,
      <lb/>made her often express a doubtful Consern, lest she shou'd not
      <lb/>continue to the End, She had the Grace to Cleave to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
      <lb/>in these Circumstances, &amp; long'd Ardently for a nearer Connextion
      <lb/>with him &amp; his people by Reception in to the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> which was
      <lb/>granted Her April 20<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1772 to her great Joy March 20<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1773 She
      <lb/>had the favour to be the first time Spectator at the holy Comm<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>. &amp; as
      <lb/>it was clear to her that She was in a decline, her only desire was
      <lb/>now to obtain the end of all her wishes
      <lb/>Viz</ab><pb facs="#facs_2" n="2" xml:id="img_0002"/><ab facs="#facs_2_r1" type="">
      <lb/>Namely to be a perticipant of the Body &amp; Blood of Christ, in the
      <lb/>holy Sacrement, for Her Sickness prov'd a real Searching time
      <lb/>to her, during which She kept many Openhearted bands
      <lb/>with Her Choir Labroures, &amp; it was manifest that our D<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
      <lb/>was preparing her for himself, of which She was very Sensible
      <lb/>desiring only to be fitted here for his Eternal Embraces,
      <lb/>Her longing desire for the Holy Sacrament was granted on her Sickbed, a few days
      <lb/>before her Departure during a Blessed feeling to all who were
      <lb/>present, She lay very still for some time, in a deep enjoyment
      <lb/>of this great grace! Expressing her thankfulness that she had now
      <lb/>enjoy'd all she wished for in this World, &amp; now only waited for the
      <lb/>Last Kiss from his pale Lips. The last Night She desir'd the
      <lb/>Sisters might be call'd up, when She took a tender leave of them
      <lb/>Saying O my dear Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> if I was but able to tell you what I enjoy'd
      <lb/>If I had but know before what a Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> he is to poor needy Sinners,
      <lb/>Once more let me entreat God to beleave in him! She cou'd not
      <lb/>Express the tender Gratitude of her Heart Sufficiantly to those
      <lb/>arround her, but as a truly Enamor'd Heart look'd out with longing
      <lb/>for the happy moment, when her Belov'd wou'd Receive her into
      <lb/>his Arms, desiring the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> to join in her petition, that He
      <lb/>might soon come &amp; take her to him self, which he accordingly
      <lb/>did on May 18 1773. in the 33 Year of her Age. Accompaied with
      <lb/>the Blessing of her Choir &amp; a Sensible feeling of the nearess of her
      <lb/>unseen friend &amp; Bridegroom, with whome She now rests in Peace.</ab></div></body></text></TEI>
