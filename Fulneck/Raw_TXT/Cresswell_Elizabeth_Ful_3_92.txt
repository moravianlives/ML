Some particulars of the gracious
leading of our Lord & Saviour
with the happily departed Sister
Elizabeth Cresswell who entered
into her eternal Rest Decr 18th
1808 aged 20 yrs & 6 Months.
The deceased having left no
written Memorial of her short
but happy course through
time, what is now offered is the
Knowledge of her leading by
an affectionate Relative narra
ted partly as the most plea
sing Relief to a deeply affec
ted Mind having also in


view the benefit especially of
those of her own Age, who
may discover something in her
Example to follow, in her expe
rience to instruct, & in her
enjoyments to comfort & strengthen
them in their spiritual Course.
She was born in Fairfield
June 21st 1788 of Parents living
in the bosom of the Congregation,
whose primary concern it was,
to bring up all their Children
in the nurture & admonition
of the Lord; & who found in this
their important & weighty
Duty, much to pray for, much
to weep over, under a sense of
their manifold defects, and
much indeed to be thankful


for, in the comfort they have
had with this precious Charge.
The Education of this Sister
was strictly regulated by a
regard to her Happiness with
her Saviour, designing in the
cultivation of her Mind to
unite the lighter Ornaments
of the true Christian Character.
Of her it may be said She was
in the true meaning of the word
a Congregation Child. Her pursuits
her enjoyments, her happiness were
found in it, with as little of de
sire after the Vanities of Allure
ments of the World as is gene
rally found in what She was
by nature, a fallen depraved
sinfull Creature.


At an early age She was pla
ced under the care of Sister Tyrrell
for her Education & with her ol
der Sister One of the number in
the beginning a Seminary for
Education out of which small
beginning hath arisen a prospe
rous Boarding School where many
Children with herself have enjoyed
the advantage of liberal and
religious Instruction; She al
ways spoke of this with grati
tude in having the pleasure
of instruction without rigour
to make it irksome, or Laxity
to defeat the purpose.
In her early years the work of
Grace through the Means, found


entrance to her Heart and
particularly so in the Childrens
Meetings & Meetings for In
struction in Divine Truths. She
was a hearer of that Word with
abiding Effect finding in the
Manifestations of the Love of
Christ, that He was made unto
her as a Child; Wisdom, Righteous
ness Sanctification & Redemption
On the 22nd of April 1797 it
pleased God to visit her Family
with a very afflicting dispensa
tion in the affecting but truly
happy departure of her Dear
Mother leaving her disconsolate
Father encompassed with a
heavy weight of temporal


Concerns & charged with the care
of eight very young Children this
painful Bereavement was in
its nature attended with distres
sing consequences to so large a
Family & if there was any pe
riod more than another when
our Dr Sister with the other
branches of the Family did
not fully enjoy that watchful
unremitting care, which is a
Parents Province, and faithful
Parents Joy, it was during the
interval of their Father's widow'd
state, when many Circumstan
ces continued to interrupt this
most pleasant of all Duties
With gratitude and


thankfulness to the Lord it must
be said, that on the second
Marriage of their Father, all
that was lost to the Children
and their first parent, was res
tored in the second, in whom
have been enjoyed a Mother's
tenderness, & Fidelity & with a
harmony so undisturbed that
it has often been remarked by
the Children, that in Affection &
chearful Obedience they had
every thing that could promote
Domestic Happiness.
This was strikingly experienced
during the edifying Sickness
and happy departure of Sister
Creswell's only Daughter Deborah


Shepley, when evry part of the
Family from motives of pure love
were concerned to soften the acute
distress of their Parents.
When She was added to the
great Girls Choir She felt the
propriety of attending to its
meaning & this enquiry led to
much solid reflection as to the
aim of Congregation priviledges,
experiencing with increasing
clearness, her special Call to this
people of God not because they
were the people She had been
brought up with only but from
a conviction that it was the Lord's
intention to make her happy
in this his own Flock and


Fold & that without constraint,
perplexity or doubt, Hers should
be the Bliss, to be a Sheep of Jesus,
& to be guided by his Shepherds
Voice
On the first of January 1801 She
had the favor to be receiv'd into
the Congregation, & in the latter
part of the same year her Choir
Labourer kindly disposed to
further her progress in Congregan
priviledges, & thinking probably
more favorably of her Hearts
Course, than she herself experienc'd
proposed her as Candidate for
the Holy Communion which was
granted her Octr 10th 1801. She has
often remarked with much


concern that the long interval
between her being a Spectator &
partaker of this Sacrament was
of all the periods in her Life the
most humbling to her recollection
the most barren and Enjoyment
wherein a deeper knowledge of
herself was wanting & true
experience, where her preservation
from Evil of every kind was to be
found; But thanks to the ma
ternal care of the good Shepherd
She was not left a heedless stranger
to his Voice, but was graciously led
to more humbling Views of her
Sinfulness & great depravity, and
more comforting discoveries of the
riches of sovreign Grace, & of the
meaning of that precious Gospel
truth, that He was made Sin
for us who knew not Sin, that


we might be made the
Righteousness of God in him.
How particularly She felt the
unspeakable value of private
prayer, in the observance of
which She had been carefully
led from her earliest years; Now
more than ever She felt the
enlightening, quickening influ
ence of the Spirit of God, & as a
needy Supplicant was brought
to the Mercy Seat, not in the
formal unaffected expression
of what the Heart felt not, but
in the pouring out her wants
as they existed, & this with a
conscientious and scrupolous
faithfulness, that She could not
excuse herself in the Omission
of this sweet priviledge ev'ry
Morning & Evening in her Life


Thus in the School of the Holy
Ghost she was prepar'd for that
enjoyment which awaited her
when on the 4th of May 1805
she partook for the first time of
the Lords body & Blood sacrament
with her favor'd Choir, & as a
needy Sinner sat down at the
Table of the Lord, there to enjoy
this Heavenly Repast there to be
strengthened with encreasing
Evidences of her Election of Grace
On the 4th of May 1806 She was
red'd into the Single Srs Choir
entering into this Covenant of Love
with her whole Heart, and
esteeming it her highest Honor
to be number'd with a people


of God whose priviledge it is, to
live for and to him, who gra
ciously accepts so mean a Sa
crifice. Her unchanged Mind
respecting this her Call was
further manifested on the 2nd
of November when with three
other young Sisters she was
seen by a Deputatation from the
College of Overseers & solemnly
gave her Hand to abide thro'
our Saviours Grace faithful to
the Congregation and its
Statutes.
Her naturally open and
chearfull disposition obtain'd
her many Friends. In the
Sisters of her own Choir She


found a corresponding influ
ence of Impressions like her
own, more improved by
experience & matured judgement.
In this she was particularly
favored by the closest ties of
Affection with her Cousin,
Sr Mary Lees, who watched her
growing years, & growth in
Grace, with a partial fondness
and on many Occasions
approved herself a discreet
and prudent Adviser. The
pleasure and benefit She
had in numerous little acts
of Love from this valued Sister


rendered her removal to a
heavenly Inheritance a pain
ful trial, and was One of the
salutary Mementos which
shewed that whilst we are
indulged to cherish & justly to
estimate the worth of Social
Affections when sanctified
by Grace, yet not the Creature
but that Creator is the Supreme
Good
2 Will it not be remarked,
that this detail exhibits too
much of a perfect rather than
what She was, a sinfull
unworthy Creature. Should


Language; When a sense of
her innate Misery, humbled
her in the Dust, & when reti
ring from the Family to her
Chamber she had to cry to
him who will not bruise the
broken Reed nor quench the
smoking Flax but waitheth
that he may be gracious to
all that seek him and Since
rity & truth
The latter part of the year
1807 was a season of trial
in this way, when the
work of God was powerful
by operating until the
work of Righteousness
was peace & the effect of it
quietness & assurance for ever


Experiencing at this time de
mands upon her she had
never felt before, in a Renum
nation of every thing to the
Supreme Will, She was
led in conversations with
her Choir Labourer with
whom she was very confi
dent to express her desire
for usefulness in the Lords
Service & was encouraged
to that Surrender of herself
to herse Saviour so justly
due, whose demands upon
his Children are insepara
ble from their Happiness
and who was never yet a
hard task Master to the
weakest of his Creatures.


Early in this year her in
clinations were indulged in
going to the newly begun
 Boarding School in Duckd
as an assistant teacher, tho'
her delicate state of health
made her parents scrupulous
of her engaging in a Service
She was scarcely equal to: In
a few weeks their apprehen
sions were painfully realised
but tho her continuance was
of short duration, it was
remembered with pleasure,
& he who regards the motive
rather than the Value of the
Service itself & who so highly
estimated that Act of Love


in Mary's Tribute, accepted
with complacency the fee
ble offering of this his Dear
Child.
A Severe illness in
its first approaches from
Cold rendered her removal
necessary to her paternal
Home, and in the course of a
few weeks her Disorder assum
ed the appearance of a fixed
Decline. All Medical efforts
throughout that Spring &
Summer continuing inef
fectual to relieve, change
of air was recommended
by the faculty, & her own
inclinations according


therewith, her Mamma &
Sister Catharine were her com
panions to the Sea Coast in
Kent, were she was most ten
derly cared for with a fidelity
and Solicitude that could
not be exceeded for near 3
months & where tho' sepera
ted for a time from the
Congregn & means of Grace
the Lord's presence was with
them & his Help & Comfort
vouchsafed.
After spending a short
time in London with her
Dear Br & Sr Wright who
had recently become resi
dents there, She returned


home under increasing weak
ness but filled wh thankfulness
for all the kindness shewn her.
Still under all discouraging
Symptoms, she felt a love of
Life, a cleaving to her Dear
Relatives & desire if it was the
Lord's Will to be spared a little
longer, & this desire which
her Souls beloved would ten
derly bear with prevailed
during her Sickness: evi
dently concerned to enjoy
all in the way of Comfort, 
Support, and Affection, from
those She so dearly loved, with
out losing any thing of the
Divine Support and


confidence so richly manifested
Her tedious Sickness was
in no part of it embittered
by any thing like repining,
She had always a smile for
every Visitor, the expression in
Word and look of the serenity
with which she was blessed:
in her was fulfilled that
declaration of the psalmist
Goodness & Mercy shall
follow me all the Days of
my Life.
The day before her de
parture She was visited
by a number of Kind
Friends and to some of
them was enabled with


striking energy to testify
of her interest in her Sa
viour & Redeemer, that his
bitter sufferings his meri
torious Death were the
foundation of her Faith,
that on which she relied
to carry her in Safety
through the Valley of the
Shadow of Death into his
presence. This Favour was
granted her under a pow
erful fealing of the Peace
of God when Her immor
tal part was translated
into its Heavenly Inheri
tance, there through all
Eternity to join with


the redeemed Host in songs
of Praise to the Lambs slain.
Her choir adds the following:
The above narrative of our late
dear Sister's course through time
will, we believe, strike all, who had
the pleasure of her acquaintance,
as giving a just testimony of her
real character: and as a grateful
acknowledgment of those blessings
which our Saviour was pleased to
manifest in so particular a manner
to this highly favored soul! "not
unto me, not unto me, O Lord." would
be the language of her heart, "but
unto thy name be all the glory."
Those who have been more
intimatly connected with our late Sr
have rejoiced to observe the peculiar
grace and gifts, which were vouchsafed
unto her, in early life: it may truly
be said that she lived in close com
munion with that Friend who has
loved her, and given himself for her


and her delight was to testify of
the unbounded love of Jesus; and what
he had done for her Soul.
All opportunities for conversation
of this kind, were evidently agreeable
seasons to her. She certainly knew
herself, as a Sinner, and Jesus Christ
as her Redeemer and Saviour, on
whose all-atoning death alone she
grounded her hope. Her surviving
friends will long remember, with
heartfelt satisfaction, the many
proofs she gave, in health, as well
as sickness, that she was indeed a
child of God; whose walk and conver
sation was becoming the gospel of
Christ. We flattered ourselves with
the hope that this flourishing
plant, in the Lord's vineyard, might
soon become a useful handmaid of
his, whom he was preparing to serve
him in his church militant below;
but we how clearly percieve that
he had still far more gracious views
with this his favored child: namely,


to remove her from this wilderness
of woe, and to transplant her,
while in the bloom of mouth, into
that blessed kingdom, where sin and
sorrow can never enter: where she
now beholds  face to face him whom
her Soul loved; and who had washed
her from her sins in his own
most precious blood.
We who survive cannot but
regret the loss of this hopeful
promising young Sr but we know
that He, whose property she was,
had early prepared her for himself
and has taken her to his arms & bosom
out of tender love and mercy; we
therefore submit to his all-wise
dispensation: and sincerely wish
those who remain below, (youth
in particular) may follow her
example, in cleaving to the Lord
with full purpose of heart; and
may her departure deeply impress
this awful momento in every breast
Be ye also ready!


Poem
On the happy departure
of our beloved Sister,
Elizabeth Creswell;
who entered into the joy of
her Lord,
at Fairfield:
Decr 18th 1808.


She's gone! th' unbody'd spirit is fled;
The mortal tabernacle - dead;
Till Jesus, who hath pow'r to save
Shall raise it, glorious, from the grave.
She's gone! to mingle with the blest;
Enjoying now eternal rest:
"For her to live was Christ; while her
"To die is gain"; to see him there.
She's gone! to give increasing praise
To Him; her voice in hymns to raise,
Of gratitude, to Christ, her King;
And joyful hallelujahs sing.
She's gone! nor wishes to return;
But sweetly says to those who mourn
Her loss.
"Weep not my friends, for me
I'm happy, in eternity.
Happy, beyond all human thought
I see Him, who my soul hath bought
I view His wounds, which He endur'd;
Those wounds, which all my bliss pro


"My body to the grave convey,
To moulder in its fellow clay;
Till called forth by Christ, to rise,
And join my Soul, above the skies.
Farewell! the'appointed hour will come,
When you will be, with me, at home;
In heavenly mansions we shall meet,
Adoring at the Saviour's feet.
By faith walk in the narrow way,
Which leads to that eternal day,
Resplendent, where there is no night
Bright with the Lambs majestic light."
Tis legacy she left to all:
Be ready, at the your Saviours call!
He'll come before you are aware.
For your Lord's coming now prepare."
We at thy happy lot rejoice,
Blest Soul! & with united voice,
The Saviours praise, who thee, in love,
Removed to Himself above.
Our Wills, we to his Will, resign;
Nor at his ways would we repine:
Tho' nature drops the parting tear,
We yet, His ways with thee, revere.


Perhaps we understand not now
Fully, what he hath done; yet bow
Submissive, to his wise decree,
In all, which He hath done, with thee
Assur'd a thou'st happy with thy God,
Wash'd in the Lamb's most precious blood
Adorned with those garments white,
Which make thee precious in His sight
We too, have hope, that we shall see
Our Jesus, be eternity;
Rejoicing in this hope, we move
Till we shall join the hosts above
In singing to the Lamb once slain,
For all His wounds, his griefs & pain
His agony, his cross, his blood;
Which brought us, sinners, right to God
Vain world adieu! our world's above
We'll cherish here, no other love,
Then love to Him, who loved us
And for us dy'd upon the cross.
Now, crucify'd to all, below
May Christ this grace on us bestow"
In fellowship with Him to be,
Till we're with Him eternally.
