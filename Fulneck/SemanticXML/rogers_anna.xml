					The Course of Life of Anna Rogers
				</p>
			<p>
					I was born at Bedford on the 15 of August 1743 an lived
					with my Parrents till I was 7 years old, at that time I had
					not the least concern about our Saviour, but still I remember
					I was always afraid of dying, in the year 50 I and my
					two Sisters were taken into the Sisters House to live amongst
					the Children, I by my unbroken self wild disposion causd the
					Sisters a great deal of troube and Concern which I was very Sencable
					of and out of Pity to the Sisters us'd to make resolutions that I
					would alter for the better yet all that was to no purposse for I being
					naturerly of a Proud unsinnerlike and fretfull temper could bear
					to be found fault with all tho' I how I was to blame and often
					felt pain on account of it I told our Saviour what a poor creature
					I was and sometimes beg'd him with tears to come to my Assistance
					and to me feel his grace in my heart amidst all my untowardness
					I was fully convincd that our Saviour Persu'd me very closely tho' I strove
					to put him off and went on in a dry and indifferant manner, and by
					so doing tryd our Saviour Patientious exceeding but his love towards
					me his poor Child never ceasd; at certain time I was overcome in
					a power full manner perticularly in those Meetings which us Children
					kept amongst our Selves, as on our Singing hours were his perecious
					nearness was so captivating to my heart that I often burst out into
					a flood of tears on the 17 August 53 that never to be forgoten day
					Br Sclicht who was then at Bedford kept a Love feast with he
					asking us in a tender manner if we from this time on woud Surrender
					our selves to our Saviour and then he desired as to Prostrate before him
					this being the first Meeting of that kind I <del>was ever</del> ever was present as I was
					Sear'd with love and awe in such a manner that my heart melted into
					tears of the thro' bord feet of our friend and lover whos precious nearness
					left a deep impression upon my poor heart In 59 I went live in the
					Oeconomay at Chelsea where I had the grace and favour sometime to
					enjoy the Meeting, which the dear disciple kept when the Girls Oeconomy

					removed to fulneck I also went with them and woul lived very chearfully
					in the begining but my depravity begun to grow Stronger and Stronger and
					I lost that Childlike feeling which I had had of our Saviour and by degrees
					become more and more indifferent in my heart in 56 I was recived into
					the great girls Choir in which I did not spend my time to our Saviour nor
					my Sisters satisfaction and being convinsd of it I begun to be exceeding
					uneasy in my mind and wishd that I might once be made Sencable of
					the cause of my unhappyness and why I did not prosper but I did not
					not know my own heart neither our Saviours intention I was obligd to
					wait long before I was recived into the Congregation and therefore I was
					apt to think that I was forgoten by my B<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">rn</hi> and S<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">rs</hi> but I
						found
					afterwards that my heart at that time was not prepared for it and
					begun to discover so much of my own sinfulness I lost all hopes of
					being recived how ever our Saviour granted me this grace on the 21
					of August which proved a real blessing to me at that time I prayd
					our Sariour to grant me on abideing <del>ing</del> feeling of his nearness &amp;
					let me once expernce the forgiveness of all my Sins but I soon lost
					that desire again grew cold in my heart and gave up all hopes that I 
					Shoud ever be other ways some time I usd to think in a reasoning way
					that our Saviour did not hear my Prayers Since my good resolutions
					were all to no purpose this reflection made me grow quite negleject
					about my Self and evrything else Ive folo'd to be no more concern'd it
					might go as it woud in this uphappy disposion of heart and mind
					I went for some time and there by causd the Sisters many anxious
					hours and it was is if I coud not help it tho' much distresd with
					condemnation in my own heart in the year 59 I and two other Girls was
					to go and live in the Single Sisters house I hardly knew how to take this
					as I thought my Self very unfilt in body and mind for it and the
					more as I knew no other but that I should have to work for my living
					by Spinning the went very hard with me for I did not like that work
					at all in Some respects I thought that I should like better than I
					did in the Oeconomey but when it came to it it did not go well
					with me in regard to the forementiond Ocasion, when I saw some
					Sisters admitted the holy Communion which had not been so long
					in the Congregation as I this brought me in a certain concern again

					about my self I had not been long in the Choir house before I got
					a very ill pain in my Side which at last proved a swelling I was
					under the Doctors Hand who tryd all means to keep me but to little
					fever rose I often felt heavy on that acount but still I believd our
					Saviour knew best for what he intended to lay this upon me I there
					fore desired him from the bottom of my heart that he might let
					me feel his grace that so I might bear my pains with Patientous
					and become more resignd according to his heart which he did and I
					believe be had good reason for bringing me in these circumstances
					for as I have since seen that he very likely could not have gain his
					full aim with me May 62 I was recived into the Single Sisters
					Choir which proved a perticular day of grace for me I beg our
					Saviour that he to make me a true Virgin for him and from that time
					on I felt a more eardent disire to became still better acquainted with
					him and get my heart Sprinkld with his blood so that he might
					once atain his full aim with me thus I went on in a confident
					manner relying upon our Saviour as a poor needey Sinner my
					longing and desire after the Communion much increasd but as for
					very sinners about my self this was the reason why I did not speak
					much to my Labours about it but more earnist beg'd our Saviour
					first to prepare my heart for it my Body illness grow worse so
					that I was obligd intirely to take to the Sick room in 63 being
					Maunday <add place="above">Thursday</add> I was made a Candidate <del>I was made</del> for the holy
					Comunion which unexpected grace bow'd me down in the dust
					at my Bridegrooms feet and he was pleased to step before my
					heart in that Figure wherein he did sweat blood in the
					Garden and was naild to the Cross on my account to reddem
					me lost and undone Creature this left an abideing impression
					upon my heart and from that time on I became more chearfull
					happy and contented and my chief desire was to live for our
					Saviour and become according to his mind yea to aford him
					joy for his unweary'd love and patienteous towards me the 30
					of July I had the unspeakable favour granted me to become
					a partaker of his Body and blood in the Holy Sacrament how I felt
					at the injoyment of this my highest I good I am not able to express

					in words my heart was melted like wax before my dearest lover whos
					tenderness towords me his poor Sinner has been without compare
					<del>I now am waiting</del> I now spend my time waiting for the kiss from
					his pail lips with a heart full of gratitude for all grace &amp;
					blessings which I have recieved at his hands and he has now made
					all things ease to me ever in gard to my outward circumstances
					so that I have nothing to disturbe my mind with and I am glad
					to go to him as a poor Sinner, and will kiss his thro' bord feet with
					my thankfull tears, so far her own words.

					she had somthing very agreeable which greatly gain her Sisters
					love and tenderness, altho' we must own that yet course thro this
					time has not been as could have wishd, yet it was plainly
					percived that she never was without a feeling from our Saviour
					in her heart which proved an inecouragement to those who had to do
					with her and perticularly in her last illness which she bore with
					great patientious as she believed that by these means our Saviour
