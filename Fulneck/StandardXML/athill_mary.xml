					<lb/>Mary Athill died July / 46
					<lb/>Born with twin S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> Sarah in Antigua 18
					<lb/>July 9 / 14. came to Brit<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> in 1821 first 
					<lb/>to Edinbro&apos;, then to Fuln. Sch with elder
					<lb/>S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> Esther; remained here till Oct<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> / 28, when 
					<lb/>went first to London, where confirm<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> in 
					<lb/>ch of Engl<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> in 1829 went back to Antigua
					<lb/>where rem<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> till / 36; after residence of
					<lb/>5 yrs in Lond came to live in S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> house
					<lb/>here in / 41. Admitted com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> members
					<lb/>in summer / 43.
					<lb/>In the course of last year certain circum
					<lb/>stances occurred, which convinced our late
					<lb/>S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi>, in a painful manner, but most affec
					<lb/>tually of the emptiness &amp; deceitfulness of
					<lb/>this world; &amp; shewed her that, however se re
					<lb/>cluded mote from worldly vanity &amp; pleasure
					<lb/>our settlements may be, they are at the
					<lb/>same time screened from much evil,
					<lb/>&amp; unvisited by many &amp; placing
					<lb/>my bitter &amp; heart rending cares &amp; sor
					<lb/>rows; &amp; that true place &amp; lasting en
					<lb/>joyment are to be found only in the
					<lb/>ways of genuine piety; in a word, that
					<lb/>&quot;godliness with contentment&quot; is great
					<lb/>gain. The consequence was that,
					<lb/>after on returning, after an absence of
					<lb/>about 8 mo<hi rend='superscript:true;'>s.</hi> to our S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs&apos; </hi>house &amp; to the
					<lb/>church of the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi>. she evidently lived
					<lb/>in much more comfort than before,
					<lb/>set a higher value on her privileges,
					<lb/>temporal &amp; spiritual, seemed to enjoy
					<lb/>the means of grace, &amp; grew, we trust
					<lb/>in the inner way, in knowledge &amp; 
					<lb/>in grace.
					<lb/>Her health was always delicate, &amp; in
					<lb/>the course of last Winter, began to fail
					<lb/>more &amp; more, so that, in spring, fears began

					<lb/>to be entertained of the result. In
					<lb/><hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>May</hi> June last month she went to Burlington to try the
					<lb/>effect of the sea-air; but all was in vain, &amp;
					<lb/>she returned in abt. a fortnight <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>for</hi>
					<lb/>weaker than when she left us. About a week After
					<lb/>her arrival here, however, she seemed to
					<lb/>rally very much so that we began to che
					<lb/>rish hopes of her eventual recovery; but she
					<lb/>soon sank again, &amp; very rapidly; &amp; a
					<lb/>physician being called in, at once de
					<lb/>clared that there was not a shadow of
					<lb/>hope. It fell to my lot to inform our
					<lb/>late sister of this, which I did in as gentle
					<lb/>a manner as I could devise. From the
					<lb/>commencement of her illness, she had
					<lb/>expressed a very great anxiety to recover;
					<lb/>&amp; tho&apos; she seemed aware how well
					<lb/>founded were the many hints were her
					<lb/>of the danger of her case, &amp; of the necessity
					<lb/>of preparing to meet her God, &amp; that she 
					<lb/>certainly did not neglect the one thing
					<lb/>needful, yet she flattered herself with 
					<lb/>hopes of recovery getting better &amp; clung to life, until 
					<lb/>the interview I had with her above allu
					<lb/>ded to &amp; which took place in the evening
					<lb/>of 8<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi>, the day before her birthday. She
					<lb/>certainly seemed both alarmed &amp; distressed
					<lb/>when she at length learned there was no
					<lb/>hope; but she listened most eagerly, &amp; I
					<lb/>believe, with childlike faith, to my ear
					<lb/>nest adminitions, to turn to Jesus, the 
					<lb/>Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> from sin &amp; deathl &amp; also to the encou
					<lb/>ragements I endeavoured to give her, by 
					<lb/>pourtraying in scripture-phrase, the
					<lb/>infinite compassion &amp; tender mercy
					<lb/>of that Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi>, his readiness to pardon
					<lb/>&amp; receive every one that believeth. X
					<lb/>Before this period she had often been hard
					<lb/>X as well as to the fervent I offered up by her side

					<lb/>praying very fervently in the night. ???
					<lb/>for acceptance in the Beloved for pardon,
					<lb/>peace, santification &amp; redepemtion. 
					<lb/>From the day just now mentioned,
					<lb/>July 8<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> I found her, at each subse
					<lb/>quent visit, more &amp; more composed,
					<lb/>her light &amp; peace of mind continually
					<lb/>increasing; she was evidently delighted
					<lb/>to hear of Jesus, &amp; to listen to the prayers
					<lb/>offered up on her behalf &amp; was, no doubt,
					<lb/>very grateful to her choir-labourer &amp; 
					<lb/>other friends for all spiritual advice &amp; en
					<lb/>couragement given her as well as for other proofs
					<lb/>of kindness &amp; various attentions.
					<lb/>I saw her last on Saturday 18<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> visit
					<lb/>about noon; she then told me, that she
					<lb/>felt quite happy &amp; had no fear of death
					<lb/>because she was persuaded that, tho&apos; she
					<lb/>knew herself to be a poor miserable
					<lb/>sinner, her Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> had pardoned her blotted
					<lb/>out all her sins, &amp; would receive her
					<lb/>in mercy to himself. In this peace
					<lb/>ful frame she continued until 5
					<lb/>o&apos;clock on Sunday morning, when after 
					<lb/>having suffered some violent convul
					<lb/>sions, she fell asleep in Jesus, aged
					<lb/>32 years.
					<lb/>Our last Sister&apos;s conduct was gene
					<lb/>rally speaking regular, strictly moral,
					<lb/>&amp; marked generally speaking, by
					<lb/>uprightness &amp; conscientiousness.
					<lb/>Yet we will not deny that there were
					<lb/>not many decided manifestations in
					<lb/>her character, of spiritual life, until
					<lb/>her last illness. the good Providence
					<lb/>of God led her last year thro&apos; heavy trials, which
					<lb/>ever bless for her instruction in
					<lb/>righteousness, &amp; prepared her we believe,

					<lb/>for those life-giving operations of His
					<lb/>spirit, which finally issued contract
					<lb/><hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>&amp; believe</hi> in <hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>her</hi> full salvation, &amp; in her

					<lb/>of the saints in light. May the
					<lb/>Lord be the consolation &amp; support of
					<lb/>her surviving twin sister &amp; give her
					<lb/>both her &amp; all our young members
					<lb/>yea of all us grace. to give diligence
					<lb/>to make our calling &amp; election sure, 
					<lb/>&amp; to work while it is called to day
					<lb/>seeing the night cometh, in which no
					<lb/>man can work.
