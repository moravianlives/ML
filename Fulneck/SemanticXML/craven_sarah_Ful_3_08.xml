					The Life of the Single Sister Sar<hi rend="superscript:true;">h</hi> Craven who departed
					in Fulneck Nov<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 10<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1790.
				</p>
			<p>
					I was born at Rothwel near Leeds in Yorkshire Nov<hi rend="superscript:true;">r:</hi> 11<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1719 and
					Liv'd with my Parents till my Father died who belong'd to the 
					Church of England. When I was a Child I often wish'd to die, for
					I thought at that age I shou'd be saved; but if I liv'd to grow
					up to be a Woman I should come into things which would hinder
					me from attaining eternal happiness. When I came into riper
					years I follow'd the World with eagerness, tho not with satisfaction
					for I often felt uneasy in my mind, but put it off, resolving to
					grow better, but still went on in my old way. After my Father's
					death I went to live with my Uncle, and was with him when M<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
					Ingham came into those parts, but soon after went to live with my
					Mother: she ask'd me to go with her to hear him Preach, but I
					declin'd it for this reason, I believ'd if I was one of his followers
					I must renounce the World; which was my cheif Object at that time
					Soon after he came again to preach nearer to our habittution; my
					Mother urged me to go with her which I could not help complying with
					tho, spiritually dead, and the discourse had no effect, and I wonder'd

					what induc'd People to run after him, my Mother invited him to
					Preach at our House but he did not chuse to do it except we
					would have a Society settled, to which she consented. In the mean
					time my Mother spoke very closely to me about the state of my
					Soul; thus prepar'd I went to hear him again, During his Sermon
					I was made sensible of my last condition, I wish'd I could alter,
					and thought I had better be depreved, of this Worlds pleasure then
					love my mortal Soul, I thought I could part with every thing
					I had in the World to be assur'd of my Salvation; but fear'd it
					was impossible. In this miserable state I continued a long time
					and came into self working. by degrees my misery worse off and
					I concluded this was the right way to do all the good that was in my
					power, so my conscience was to be appeased, but being of a hasty
					temper and sometimes overcome with passion, my good oppinion
					of my self vanish'd and I became miserable again. In the Year
					1740. M<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi> Ingham and B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Teltshig came to our house, the latter
					could not speak English, but his look made a particular impression
					on me and I believed him to be indeed a Child of God. In a short time
					after this Visit out Society was dispers'd which troubled me very
					much. One of them and myself desir'd to be admitted into another Society
					wich was soon after the case with a small company at Holbeck near
					Leeds; But not having the pleasure to see B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> often, I grew dry
					in my heart, Upon being ask'd to be Servant in a Family, I at first

					refused but being earnestly intreated I at last accepted and went to
					the place. I was very uneasy in it for I found. I had no freedom
					to mix in worldly company, but was Oblidged to stay my time
					out. The night before I left my place, I drew that Verse, When
					I was lost and far had stray'd. Into a Desart wild &amp; the day
					after when I was with my Mother some Sisters came to see me, I
					told them what had pass'd, they advised me to make a new begining
					and then our Saviour and the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> would forgive me these words
					comforted me for I did not expect to hear such from them. The first
					meeting I went to after their Visit, B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Telstig kept on the following
					words" ye cannot serve two Masters "it seem'd as if he directed
					his discourse to me alone and I determin'd to have our Saviour
					alone for my Master. a short time after I was advised to live with
					two Sisters in Holbeck, I did so, but my sittuation was not at first
					agreable to me, I did not remain long with them being desir'd by
					B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Tiltsheg to go to Leeds to wait on a Sick Sister, but soon became
					sick myself, as I had then no money left to help me I <add place="above">was</add> persuaded to 
					live with my Mother with whom I remain'd till she died. The day
					before she departed a Sister visited her <add place="above">&amp; asked her </add>where she would like to have
					me sittuated; she reply'd, among the Sisters, But after her death I
					felt such a strong attachment to my Relations that I thought I could
					not part with them, which brought me again into trouble and quite
					at a loss what to do, When I was by my self my faithful Monitor
					convinc'd me once more that I was not in my right place; to stay then
					would be dangerous for my Soul. I immediately set off to acquaint

					my former Laboress and disclos'd my whole case, She recomended
					me to another Family in Holbeck, this was in the Year 1750
					I attended the Preaching in Fulneck every Sunday. B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> LaTrobe
					Sermons were a real blessing<hi rend="strikethrough:true;">s</hi> to me and I frequently imagin'd
					that he knew my inmost thoughts, I had no rest day nor night
					on account of the burden of my sins, One day as I was by myself
					earnestly entreating our Saviour to manifest himself unto me,
					he granted, my request and gave me a full assurance of the for
					giveness of my sins, which came with such power that it melted
					me into tears. from this time and particularly during my stay
					in that Family, I received many blessings from our Savior, This
					was a particular period with the Brethrens Congregation, their
					enemies in these parts where not affraid to prognasticate their
					ruin notwithstanding this I wish'd for a still closer union with
					them and importun'd to be a member of the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> The two S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>
					with whom I Liv'd having departed this Life it was thought proper
					for me to leave Holbeck and I was placed at last to my great joy
					in the Single S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Oeconomy at Gomersal May 20<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1755, and was
					soon at home with them, tho, it prov'd a new school for my heart.
					The 3<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> of March 1756 I was inform'd would be a general Congregation 
					Day. I got an impression on that day I should have the favor to
					be added thereto, I therfore kept a band with our Savior sensible of
					my poverty and helplessness yet comforted with his nearness.

					In this Sittuation of mind according to my impression I was
					received into the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> on the above mentioned day which
					prov'd a great blessing to me Thus far her own account

					April 20<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1756 our late Sister remov'd from Gommersal to live
					in the Choir House here. March 21<hi rend="superscript:true;">st</hi> 1757 she partook of the 
					holy Communion with the Congregation for the first time, It
					was evident notwithstanding all human imperfection that she
					had found her peace with our Savior. She knew in whom <add place="above">she</add> beleivd
					and was perswaded that he was able to keep that which she
					had comitted unto him this help'd her through every trying
					circumstance she met with; her call to the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> of Jesus she
					value'd highly and often spoke of it with the greatest gratitude
					It was a particular <add place="above">pleasure</add> to her to serve her Sisters in any little
					matters she was able to do which she did with great faithfulness
					as long as her strength would admitt of it. The begin<hi rend="strikethrough:true;">g</hi>ning of
					this Year an Asmatick complaint which she had labor'd
					under many years grew very troublesome to her, so that
					She was oblidg'd in Jan<hi rend="superscript:true;">y</hi> to move into the sick room, when
					her longing to be at home with our Savior increased daily. It
					gave her much pain when two of her companions in the Sick

					room were called home before her, she suffer'd much in her sick,
					ness which made her sometimes rather impatient and think 
					the time long, but she would soon recollect herself again and in
					treated our Savior to give her a Childlike resignation to his will
					that she might not greive him by her impatience. The night
					before her departure, she said I am waiting for our Saviour
					to come and fetch <del>her</del> me, he will not be long now before he comes
					I shall then see him for my self; sickness and sorow will have
					an end, He will wipe all tears from my Eyes. that night she
