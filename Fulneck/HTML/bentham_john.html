      <p> The Life of the mar'd Brother<a href="#mlper000548.html">John Bentham</a> who was called Home the <em>9<sup>th</sup> August 1772.</em></p>
      <p> He has dictated the following concerning himself. </p>
      <p>I was born at <a href="#mlpla000092.html">Black Hay in Pudsey Township</a><em>1713</em> &amp; baptised in the Church of England My Mother being
         						poor &amp; not able to care for me I was put out <sup>by the family</sup> as a Towns apprentice to a Presbiterian. I had no Mind to go on Sundays with any Master to his place of Worship, &amp; having
         no
         							Concern on my Mind about my Salvation I went no where. My Master observing this told me I
         should be lost if I continued in the way I then was, &amp; should go to a
         						place of Torment when I died. This had the Effect upon me that I went to Church
         &amp; then I thought my Case was safe, but even this proved the Occasion to hurtful Entanglements, &amp; also to my marryingunhappily which was attended with many painful Consequences. By this
         						Marriage I had 2 Daughters. When <a href="#mlper000536.html">M<sup>r</sup>. Ingham</a> began to preach in these parts I want to hear him, &amp; the
         						Word had some Effect upon me for some Time, but alas, I soon got into my old
         wretched Course again. Being one Sunday at <a href=".html">Tong
            							Church</a> I was asked by the late B<sup>r</sup><a href="#mlper000713s.html">Jonathan Heartly</a> to go with him to hear the Brethren at <a href=".html">Bankhouse</a>; at first I told him I
         						would not, but he however prevailed upon so to do, &amp; I have abundant Reason
         to thank my dear Sav<sup>r</sup> that He
         						inclined me to go. What I there heard of the Love of our Sav<sup>r</sup>melted my heart &amp; had the Effect upon me that I returned home in a very different Mind to what I
         had
         						before, being now determined to seek in earnest after the Salvation of my Soul,
         nor could I afterwards have Rest or Satisfaction till I found Mercy &amp; peace in <a href=".html">Jesus Christ</a>. Soon after this I was rec'd into the Society, &amp; <em>March 25<sup>th</sup> 1758</em> I was red'd into the Cong<sup>n</sup>, &amp; the <em>same
            							Year</em> was admitted to the holy Communion &amp; spent my Time in a truly happy Manner in sweet Fellowship with my kind Lord &amp; Redeemer. This was a most </p>PAGE BREAK
      <h2>2</h2>
      <p>blessed Season to my poor Heart, &amp; happy would it have been for me if I
         						had remained in this Connexion with my Sav<sup>r</sup> but turning aside from Him &amp; not proving this Grace nightly I
         						gave Opportunity to the Enemy to blind my Eyes again, to lay hold of me as his
         Captive &amp; to lead me according to his Will, &amp; thus was brought into most shameful &amp; scandalous Things to the unspeakable Grief of the whole Cong<sup>n</sup>, &amp; still more to the Grief &amp; Reproach of my merciful Sav<sup>r</sup>, &amp; which was oftenwards attended Lord with much Loss, Distress &amp; Anguish to my own Soul as no one but myself can have a true Conception of. I brought myself into Hell Torment indeed for I forfeited my place &amp; privileges in the Cong<sup>n</sup>, &amp; lost all Sight &amp; feeling of my Sav<sup>r</sup> &amp; my Sins lay so heavy upon me that I knew no possible way of living in this Condition, All which Misery was
         						occasioned by the well known Circumstances of my second Marriage. I &amp; my wife being both guilty &amp; also both miserable &amp; unhappy beyond Description we knew not what to do but to weep &amp; cry to <a href=".html">Jesus</a> that if possible He might look on us in our deplorable Condition &amp; shew Mercy unto
         us. He was also
         						entreated of us &amp; had Mercy upon such abominable Sinners as we were, that we
         could believe &amp; feel that He had pardoned our many &amp; heinous Transgressions. We then prayed the whole Cong<sup>n</sup> to forgive us &amp; receive us once more into her Fellowship &amp; which in Time was granted
         unto us to our abiding Consolation. This was a Grace
         						which I shall thank my sweet Sav<sup>r</sup> for throughout my whole Life &amp; also in Eternity. From this Time I have
         						been enabled to live under a bowing Sense of my sweet Sav<sup>rs</sup>
         							Love, &amp; the Blessings I have enjoyed in the Cong<sup>n</sup> have been highly prized by me; yea every the least </p>
      <p> Crumb I enjoyed I rec'd out of Mercy as a Favour I was undeserving of. I shall never be able to thank
         Him duly for what He has done for me poor
         						unfaithful Sinner, but shall eternally sing of his Love &amp; Mercy &amp;
         						Faithfullness. So far out of his Account. Since his Readmission to the Cong<sup>n</sup> he has spent his Time as a Sinner
         						who had received Grace, &amp; acknowledged himself very undeserving of what he
         							enjoyed. Some Time ago his Constitution began to break &amp; he declined gradually, but was chearful in his Heart &amp;
         							confident to our Sav<sup>r</sup> &amp; thus continued till he obtained
         						permission to enter into the joy of his Lord.</p>PAGE BREAK</body>
