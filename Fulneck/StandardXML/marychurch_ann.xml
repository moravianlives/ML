				<lg>
					<l>A. E. Marychurch</l>
					<l>After a careful search through my dear</l>
					<l>Sisters papers I regret to say, that we</l>
					<l>have been unable to find any distinct</l>
					<l>memory of her past life, there are various</l>
					<l>short diaries written even in a very early</l>
					<l>period of her life containing statements</l>
					<l>of deep religious feeling, and ever spirit-</l>
					<l>ual experience, but she seems to have</l>
					<l>shrunk from the last of compiling</l>
					<l>any thing like a regular memoir.</l>
					<l>What she declined to do for herself from</l>
					<l>a feeling a rising probably from her ex-</l>
					<l>treme humility her brother and her</l>
					<l>friends have endeavoured in some de-</l>
					<l>gree to supply. Her life was not crowd-</l>
					<l>ed with exciting events, yet it was</l>
					<l>one of unusual usefulness, and her</l>
					<l>energies became more active as her</l>
					<l>bodily strength declined; her light shone</l>
					<l>more &amp; more until she reached the</l>
					<l>perfect day. Ann Elizabeth Marychurch</l>
					<l>was born Sep<hi rend="superscript:true;">tr</hi> 24<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1804 &amp; was baptized</l>
					<l>in the Brethrens Church in Bristol</l>
					<l>Thus her earthly course began in that</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>Church which she loved through</l>
					<l>life more than any other portion</l>
					<l>of Gods heritage, she enbibid its spirit</l>
					<l>in early childhood and cherished it</l>
					<l>to the last. Her parents were esteemed</l>
					<l>members of the Congregation &amp; her</l>
					<l>Father was for many years, most</l>
					<l>faithfully zealous and active in pro-</l>
					<l>moting its interests. On the mater-</l>
					<l>nal side, her Grandmother was one</l>
					<l>of the first members when the Congre-</l>
					<l>gation was settled in 1755. She was</l>
					<l>brought up by a very affectionate and</l>
					<l>tender mother who trained her early</l>
					<l>in the ways of Gods people. In due</l>
					<l>time she was sent to school, but her</l>
					<l>School days were not happy, she </l>
					<l>suffered much from those peculiar</l>
					<l>school troubles which are often very</l>
					<l>keenly felt by young sensitive child-</l>
					<l>ren, - speaking of her school days</l>
					<l>she once said I was a poor little timid</l>
					<l>thing and the unkind ridicule</l>
					<l>of some of the older girls made me</l>

				<lg>
					<l>very unhappy, and pressed down my</l>
					<l>spirits, so that my childhood was not</l>
					<l>so happy as it might have been.</l>
					<l>Her mother being an invalid, she became</l>
					<l>very early useful in the family and</l>
					<l>the active habits which were thus</l>
					<l>formed continued through life.</l>
					<l>In 1821 she was confirmed by the Rev<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi></l>
					<l>D<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi> Okely the minister of the Congrega-</l>
					<l>tion and in 1822 she became a received</l>
					<l>member. A dangerous illness had excit-</l>
					<l>ed Solemn thought &amp; made her feel it</l>
					<l>right to take these important steps</l>
					<l>but had not at that time received any</l>
					<l>deep religious impressions, she had not</l>
					<l>as yet felt the burden of sin, nor the</l>
					<l>inescpressible love of <hi rend="underline">Jesus.</hi> She was in-</l>
					<l>deed faithful in prayer and had ear-</l>
					<l>nest desires that every thought should</l>
					<l>be brought into captivity to Christ. She </l>
					<l>often retired for prayer, and she wrote</l>
					<l>out a solemn dedication of herself to</l>
					<l>her Saviour, but her heart was not yet </l>
					<l>decided and she could not yet say</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>Lord I will follow thee whither so ever</l>
					<l>thou goeth. But the Holy Spirit led her</l>
					<l>into clearer views of her own ruined state</l>
					<l>by nature, her sinfulness &amp; depravity in </l>
					<l>the sight of God, and often it later years</l>
					<l>did she bemoan herself almost in the</l>
					<l>language of St. Paul, "O wretched man</l>
					<l>that I am who shall deliver me from</l>
					<l>the body of this death." This deep convic-</l>
					<l>tion of the corruption of her heart com-</l>
					<l>bined at times with what she deplored</l>
					<l>as a natural tendency to sceptism</l>
					<l>frequently robbed her soul of the peace</l>
					<l>to be found in simply looking to the</l>
					<l>blood &amp; righteousness of Christ as the</l>
					<l>sinners only hope. It was once of her</l>
					<l>greatest sources of disquietude amount-</l>
					<l>ing at times to distracting torment</l>
					<l>that Satan was permitted to infuse</l>
					<l>doubts into her mind of those great</l>
					<l>and sacred truths which she cherished</l>
					<l>most dearly.</l>
				</lg></p>
			<p><lg>
					<l>Possibly her active intellect aided the</l>
					<l>temptation. But he who permitted</l>
				</lg>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>made a way to escape. Her harrased</l>
					<l>mind sought comfort in the word</l>
					<l>of God &amp; in prayer; and through the</l>
					<l>Holy Spirits help she became established</l>
					<l>strengthened &amp; settled in the faith. Still</l>
					<l>through life she at times complained</l>
					<l>of her hardness of heart &amp; slowness to</l>
					<l>believe was "her thorn in the flesh" often</l>
					<l>producing poignant distress, but like</l>
					<l>St Paul she heard the voice of comfort</l>
					<l>saying, "My Grace is sufficient for thee"</l>
					<l>There were however times especially at</l>
					<l>the Holy Comnmunion when she realized</l>
					<l>the saving love of her Lord, &amp; when her</l>
					<l>heart was filled with rapture &amp; joy</l>
					<l>Thus as life progressed she obtained</l>
					<l>deeper spiritual experience -- her faith</l>
					<l>was not a dead faith, but brought </l>
					<l>forth good fruit. It led her to work</l>
					<l>to work heartity in the Lords service. </l>
					<l>Her natural energy of character would</l>
					<l>not allow her to rest in inactivity</l>
					<l>She felt religion to be a vital matter</l>
					<l>and she became anscious to communicate</l>

					<l>it. In her early with she was a zealous</l>
					<l>Sunday School teacher, &amp; even in later</l>
					<l>years, when her infermities would have</l>
					<l>proved a sufficient excuse for refusing</l>
					<l>she undertook the Bible Class, when a</l>
					<l>difficulty of supply was experienced. She</l>
					<l>became also a faithful and valued dis-</l>
					<l>trict visitor, first in the Parish of S<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi> James</l>
					<l>under the guidance of the Rev<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> T T Beddulph</l>
					<l>and afterward in the Parish of S<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi> Michael</l>
					<l>Failing health alone compelled her to </l>
					<l>relinquish these duties, which she had</l>
					<l>performed during many years with</l>
					<l>conscientious regularlity. She took deep</l>
					<l>interest also in the work of the Bible Society</l>
					<l>and faithfully filled the office of Association</l>
					<l>Secretary to the end of her life. In conjunc-</l>
					<l>tion with the general work of the Bible</l>
					<l>Society, she watched with especial interest</l>
					<l>the origin and growth of the branch</l>
					<l>connected with the Brethrens Congrega-</l>
					<l>tion in Bristol of which her revered</l>
					<l>Father had been treasurer. These were</l>
					<l>labours of love invigorating her spiritual</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>life, and with drawing her mind from</l>
					<l>dwelling too much upon her peculiar</l>
					<l>tendency to despondency to which her</l>
					<l>nervous constitution made her constantly</l>
					<l>liable. But it was especially to the</l>
					<l>advancement of the Brethrens Mission</l>
					<l>in connection with this Congregation</l>
					<l>that she devoted her strength both of body</l>
					<l>&amp; mind. Her persevering self denying</l>
					<l>labours in behalf of this great work</l>
					<l>will not easily be forgotten. For upwards</l>
					<l>of 30 years dating from the early part</l>
					<l>of B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ramftler's ministry in this</l>
					<l>place, she held the office of Secretary</l>
					<l>of the Ladies Association, an office which</l>
					<l>she filled with increasing delight</l>
					<l>&amp; increasing efficiency. In the last</l>
					<l>year of her life she would gladly have</l>
					<l>resigned it into younger &amp; stronger</l>
					<l>hands, but her services were too valuable</l>
					<l>to be lost and she was though with</l>
					<l>difficulty, persuaded to continue them</l>
					<l>And never did her energies flag</l>
					<l>never with drooping health did she</l>
					<l>omit any effort to increase the efficiency</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>of the branch under her charge to add</l>
					<l>to the comforts of the Missionaries or to</l>
					<l>extend the sphere of their labours.</l>
					<l>Her knowledge of the special circum-</l>
					<l>stances of various Mission Stations</l>
					<l>especially those of the West Indies</l>
					<l>and the peculiar difficulties which</l>
					<l>Missionaries have to encounter, was</l>
					<l>enlarged by an extensive correspondence</l>
					<l>which she held with those devoted</l>
					<l>servants of God; and this intimate</l>
					<l>knowledge of their state she turned</l>
					<l>to good account by enlisting for them</l>
					<l>the sympathise of children of God in</l>
					<l>the various Christian denominations</l>
					<l>around her. She has ceased from her</l>
					<l>blessed labours but her works follow</l>
					<l>her and in many a distant land</l>
					<l>the announcement of her death will</l>
					<l>be received with heartfelt sorrow.</l>
					<l>May the Lord of the Vineyard raise</l>
					<l>up from this Congregation, a suitable</l>
					<l>and devoted successor. These were evi-</l>
					<l>dences external to herself that she was</l>
					<l>in possession of true saving Faith</l>
				</lg>

			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_82_Ann_Marychurch-09.jpg" n="9" />
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>which in seasons of temptation she</l>
					<l>aometimes doubted. She loved the Lords </l>
					<l>people of every name and she had a</l>
					<l>heart ever ready to sympathise in their</l>
					<l>joys &amp; sorrows </l>
				</lg></p>
			<p><lg>
					<l>To her own Church, she was warmly at-</l>
					<l>tached. Few have possessed the true</l>
					<l>Brethrens spirit in a larger degree</l>
					<l>She loved the pious practices &amp; habits of</l>
					<l>her Forefathers, she opposed innovation,</l>
					<l>she sorrowed much over what seemed</l>
					<l>to her a declension from the good old ways</l>
					<l>which so beautifully distinguish her Church</l>
					<l>from other less favoured Christian bodies</l>
					<l>Several papers were found in her desk</l>
					<l>in which she had expressed her feelings</l>
					<l>on these subjects</l>
				</lg></p>
			<p><lg>
					<l>Nevertheless she fervently loved the people</l>
					<l>of God amongst whom her lot was cast,</l>
					<l>They were the people of her choice &amp;</l>
					<l>her Church was to her as her earthly</l>
					<l>home. It was the strength of her love</l>
					<l>&amp; attachment to the Brethrens Church,</l>
					<l>which made her peculiarly sensitive</l>
					<l>as to any change in its rites &amp; customs</l>
				</lg>

					<l>In 1852 her venerable &amp; beloved Father was</l>
					<l>removed from her by sudden death.</l>
					<l>The shock which her nervous system re-</l>
					<l>ceived by this event, she never fully re-</l>
					<l>covered, the great enemy of Souls took</l>
					<l>advantage of her weak state to strengthen</l>
					<l>old doubts and fears and to infuse new</l>
					<l>ones, so that she was at times led to</l>
					<l>question whether she had ever escperienced</l>
					<l>real saving grace. Her condition for a</l>
					<l>time was most unhappy it was evi-</l>
					<l>dently in a great degree the result</l>
					<l>of a morbid state of the nervous system</l>
					<l>&amp; excessive bodily weakness. But as her</l>
					<l>heath gradually improved, she was en-</l>
					<l>abled to overcome these temptatous to </l>
					<l>despondency and to prove more than </l>
					<l>conqueror through Him that loved her.</l>
					<l>In 1860 her health received another shock</l>
					<l>by the fracture of a leg, whilst on a visit</l>
					<l>at Calne. Under this severe affection, she</l>
					<l>manifested the true spirit of the child</l>
					<l>of God by her extreme patience &amp; resignation</l>
					<l>Indeed all these toubles seemed to ripen</l>
					<l>her for her heavenly home. She even spoke</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_82_Ann_Marychurch-11.jpg" n="11" />
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>of the state of her soul with humility</l>
					<l>and fear, but her faith and love were </l>
					<l>growing stronger &amp; stronger.</l>
				</lg></p>
			<p><lg>
					<l>In reference to her illness at Calne she wrote</l>
					<l>thus, I feel that I must be satisfied to be</l>
					<l>an invalid, but it is all right, I feel more</l>
					<l>about it for my dear sympathising friends</l>
					<l>than for myself. I only want the work &amp;</l>
					<l>grace of Christ to be more manifested</l>
					<l>within me &amp; by me and my coldness</l>
					<l>&amp; deadness to be absorbed in the warmth</l>
					<l>and life of Christ. Again she wrote in</l>
					<l>prospect of a change for her healths sake:</l>
					<l>"It may do me good if the Lord please,</l>
					<l>but I wish to leave it without any ansciety</l>
					<l>&amp; without a choice, I expect to go halting</l>
					<l>to the end of my days, but I trust a</l>
					<l>cheerful mind &amp; patience will be given</l>
					<l>me." Though so long a sufferer, her death</l>
					<l>seemed to come suddenly. In the summer</l>
					<l>of 1862 she had spent four happy weeks</l>
					<l>with her Brother &amp; Sister in the North</l>
					<l>of England who accompanied her to</l>
					<l>Fulnec</l>
				</lg></p>
			<p><lg>
					<l>She was always cheerful, delighted</l>
				</lg>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>to meet old friends, but withat indica-</l>
					<l>ting great bodily weakness, &amp; great difficult-</l>
					<l>ly breathing.</l>
				</lg></p>
			<p><lg>
					<l>On the way homewards she paid a week</l>

					<l>On her arrival at home, she seemed ra-</l>
					<l>ther improved in health than otherwise</l>
					<l>by her long journey. But as the winter</l>
					<l>advanced increased symptoms of weak-</l>
					<l>less appeared especially in the re-</l>
					<l>gion of the heart &amp; the lung.</l>
				</lg></p>
			<p><lg>
					<l>Kind friends were around her one</l>
					<l>especially watched over tenderly &amp; an-</l>
					<l>sciously until the close of life. She received</l>
					<l>also the incessant attention of an attach-</l>
					<l>ed servant who had lived in her family</l>
					<l>more than 20 years </l>
				</lg></p>
			<p><lg>
					<l>But God had thoughts of peace con-</l>
					<l>cerning her. She had at times ex-</l>
					<l>pressed fears of death, but she never</l>

					<l>an activity. She possessed a strong</l>
					<l>mind in a very weak body. Her love</l>
					<l>for Christ and for Christ's people was</l>
					<l>great, and her labours in His cause</l>
					<l>were unremitting. She now rests in</l>
					<l>peace, she has realized what she wrote</l>
					<l>in 1860 concerning a happily depart-</l>
					<l>ed and beloved Sister in Christ. "The</l>
					<l>beloved Saint is with Christ, no longer</l>
					<l>clad in weakness, and faint with suf-</l>
					<l>fering, but clothed in the bright robes</l>
					<l>&amp; our Saviour's righteousness, and</l>
					<l>rejoicing in the presence of God for</l>
					<l>ever" We may truly say this of</l>
					<l>herself, she is with that Saviour, for</l>
					<l>whom she felt it an honour to labour/</l>
					<l>Friends will indeed mourn &amp; her</l>
					<l>place on earth may not easily be</l>
					<l>filled up, but we cannot wish to</l>
					<l>bring her back, we would withdraw</l>
					<l>her an instant from the presence of</l>
					<l>Him, with whom there is fulness</l>
					<l>of joy &amp; life for ever more.</l>

					<l>A few loving words of remembrance are</l>
					<l>added to the above by one whose intimate</l>
					<l>association with the beloved Subject of</l>
					<l>this little sketch, renders it a most</l>
					<l>touching but filial duty to add her testimony</l>
					<l>of deep appreciation of and respect for the</l>
					<l>character of one, so justly endeared to all</l>
					<l>who had the privilege of her intimate</l>
					<l>friendship, and perhaps none of those </l>
					<l>who now tenderly mourn her loss can</l>
					<l>speak of the departed, with so much real</l>
					<l>knowledge of her both as an individual</l>
					<l>&amp; a Christian having shared the same</l>
					<l>home for 13 or 14 years. Her mental</l>
					<l>powers were of no common order. She</l>
					<l>possessed naturally an unusual</l>
					<l>amount of sound judgment fortitude</l>
					<l>&amp; self sacrificing generosity as well as</l>
					<l>consistancy of action, together with a</l>
					<l>true ardour &amp; depth of affection, which</l>
					<l>when once bestowed, was rarely if ever</l>
					<l>withdrawn. As a Christian her light</l>

					<l>nerves, often beclouding her otherwise</l>
					<l>strong mind, giving a morbid tone</l>
					<l>to her own expressions concerning her </l>
					<l>spiritual experience, but to those who</l>
					<l>had before them such an undeviating</l>
					<l>pattern of consistancy there remained</l>
					<l>nothing, but the precept / speaking</l>
					<l>by escample / "Go ye and do likewise"</l>
					<l>Her humility before God was a marked</l>
					<l>feature of her high attainments in</l>
					<l>the Christian life. In her last letter</l>
					<l>to the writer of those few lines she says</l>
					<l>I feel a mass of sin &amp; weakness: but</l>
					<l>follows on to say, that the all wise, bur-</l>
					<l>den bearer will enable her to cast it</l>
					<l>all on Him. <hi rend="underlined:true;">Nearness to her Saviour</hi></l>
					<l>was the one thing her soul most</l>
					<l>ardently craved. About two months</l>
					<l>ago she wrote. "Do pray dear that the</l>
					<l>Lord may be more near than ever</l>
					<l>He is very gracious, but I want to see</l>
					<l>Him face to face, to touch Him as</l>
					<l>it were." To these remarks little need</l>
					<l>be added to prove that though her</l>
					<l>spiritual life was a warfire, Yet</l>

					<l>that in the apostle's words her weapons</l>
					<l>were not carnal but mighty through</l>
					<l>God to the pulling down of strongholds.</l>
					<l>Of a truth she was clad in the armour</l>
					<l>of God and her spirit was found</l>
					<l>ready waiting When she for the</l>
					<l>last time unconsciously closed her</l>
					<l>eyes in sleep to wake in that glorious</l>
