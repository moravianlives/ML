					<l>our late Sing Br Joseph Carr has left the following account of </l>
					<l>himself.</l>
					<l>I was born in Pudsey Aug. the 27th 1764 of poor Parents &amp; baptized by the Brn at</l>
					<l>Fulneck, I used constantly to attend the public preachings at Fulneck, till my</l>
					<l>Father put me apprentice; when I was about 13 years old, to one Willm Harrison</l>
					<l>a Taylor at Stanningly, where I got acquainted with a neighbour, which</l>
					<l>proved a great detriment to me: when his wife died, he used to get me to</l>
					<l>keep his house for him, as he was a shopkeeper, while he went to the markets; &amp;</l>
					<l>on Sundays he would take me with him to public houses, &amp; into unprofitable</l>
					<l>company, so that at last it became quite indifferent to me, whether I went</l>
					<l>to any place of worship or not as my acquintance cared for the expense,</l>
					<l>&amp; I began to consider myself as my own master, I paid no regard to any</l>
					<l>admonitions, that were given me, but I thought I had met with a very</l>
					<l>good Companion. My master in particular used to tell me, that he hoped</l>
					<l>I should See the time, when I should think him not my friend, but I treated this</l>
					<l>observation with disregard &amp; slighted what he said, because he was a </l>
					<l>methodist. When I was loose from my Master, having lived with him 7</l>
					<l>Years, I continued to go in in my old course, keeping company with my</l>
					<l>friend (as I then looked upon him) the above unprofitable acquaintance. </l>
					<l>About a year after I had left my Master, it pleased our Savior to vi-</l>
					<l>sit me with a heavy sickness, so that no one thought I should recover.</l>
					<l>I made a promise at that time, that if ever I got better again, I</l>
					<l>would forsake my wicked ways &amp; turn as a poor Sinner to our Savior,</l>
					<l>but alas when I got well again, I went in as before, forgot entirely</l>
					<l>my promise, &amp; associated again with my former hurtful Companion.</l>

					<l>my Sister who belonged to the Brns Congn was much grieved about me,</l>
					<l>and tried to persuade me be attend the preaching at Fulneck, when she</l>
					<l>went thither. I went once with her on a Sunday in the afternoon, when</l>
					<l>I heard the late Br. John Miller ??? read some accounts concerning the In-</l>
					<l>dian Congn in North America, &amp; afterwards keep a Discourse. I was </l>
					<l>struck at hearing how much sooner the poor Indians were brought to the</l>
					<l>Knowledge of our Savior than such a wicked man as myself. Br</l>
					<l>Miller came down after to see my Sister &amp; as I was at work in the same</l>
					<l>room he addressed himself to me, &amp; after speaking in a friendly way</l>
					<l>with me he invited me to call &amp; I see him. I went down after, &amp;</l>
					<l>made known to him my desire to join the Brn &amp; soon after I was</l>
					<l>received into the Society, &amp; became acquainted with the Sing Brns</l>
					<l>Labourer, &amp; used to spend the time between the meetings in the S. Brns</l>
					<l>house: I little expected then, that I should once come &amp; live in it</l>
					<l>as I considered it to be too high a favor for such a great Sinner,</l>
					<l>as I then felt myself to be; I got leave also to come to the Choir-</l>
					<l>meetings on Sunday mornings, which was a real blessing to me. </l>
					<l>March 29th 1790 I came to live in the Brns house; &amp; it being the passion</l>
					<l>Week I attended the meetings, which made an abiding impression</l>
					<l>upon my heart. Decr 14 1791 I got leave to be an Inhabitant</l>
					<l>of Fulneck to my great Joy, &amp; on the 26th of decr I was received into</l>
					<l>the Congn &amp; since then, tho&apos; trials have not been wanting; our Savr</l>
					<l>has sanctified them, a help&apos;d me thro&apos; them all, for which I cannot</l>
					<l>sufficiently thank him: and I trust he will continue to lead me on</l>
					<l>to the end, poor &amp; needy as I am.</l>
					<l>Thus far our late Brothers our account of himself.</l>
					<l>June 2d 1772 he was Spectator at the holy Comunion, &amp; aug 29th</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>he partook with us of the Comunion. For some years past he has been</l>
					<l>sickly, &amp; in march last, it appeared as if his complaint would termi-</l>
					<l>nate in a Consumption: his Laborer adds concerning him: He was a Bro-</l>
					<l>ther of few words, but the feeling attending what he said, as well as the </l>
					<l>earnest desire, which he often expressed during his Sickness to go to our Savr,</l>
					<l>showed clearly, that he loved him: being once asked, whether he thought</l>
					<l>he should see the beginning of an other year? his answer was: no our Sa-</l>
					<l>vior has made it clear to me, that I shall go before the next Comunion.</l>
					<l>He departed gently &amp; happily decr 5 th 1796 &amp; is now at rest.</l>
					<l>In some papers found after his departure, he writes under Novr 13th</l>
					<l>1791. This was a very blessed day to my poor soul our Savior let me see</l>
					<l>what a thoroughly depraved &amp; Spoiled Creature I am &amp; that without</l>
					<l>him I am nothing but Sin &amp; misery, but thanks he to his name for</l>
					<l>the blessings, which I receive from him from time to time: aug 29th 1792</l>
					<l>I partook of the Holy Comunion for the first time: I cannot express in</l>
					<l>Words, what a nearness of our Savior&apos;s love to poor Sinners I then</l>
					<l>experienced. I began the year 1793 trusting in our Savior&apos;s merits, &amp;</l>
					<l>praying him to keep me ever in remembrance of his death &amp; sufferings</l>
					<l>endured on my account a poor Sinner, thanking him likewise for</l>
					<l>the many favors &amp; blessings I had received at his hand in the year</l>
					<l>past. aug 27 1793 (being his birth day) now I begin an other</l>
					<l>year: O Lord, be near to me, &amp; let me have thee in my mind both</l>
					<l>day &amp; night, I pray.</l>
