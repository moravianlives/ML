					<hi rend="underline">Memoir of our late B<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Jacob Borck who <lb />
					departed at Bedford. Oct. 24. 1791</hi> </p>
					<p>
					Our late Bro. having left no written account <lb />
					of his Life, we can only say the following: <lb />
					He was born at Arendal in Norway Oct. 13. 1727. <lb />
					He lost his Father when very Young, the pray- <lb />
					ers &amp; admonitions of his Mother who was a <lb />
					pious Woman &amp; sought to Educate him in the <lb />
					nurture &amp; admonition of the Lord were a great <lb />
					blessing to him, as a Child, &amp; when at 14 Years of <lb />
					In age he went to Copenhagen &amp; there become Sur- <lb />
					geons Mate in the Danish Army, having been <lb />
					brought up in that time of Life; In 1756 he enterd <lb />
					Into the Service of the Russians army as Surgeon, <lb />
					&amp; being in Russia, he was noticed by several <lb />
					persons of the highest Rank, both on Account <lb />
					of his engaging manners &amp; Skilfulness in his <lb />
					profession, especially by the Viceroy of Ukraine <lb />
					who greatly favord him, &amp; with whom he <lb />
					travelled thro various parts of Russia, but thro' <lb />
					these conexions he was led into bad Company, &amp; <lb />
					sinful habits, by which means he lost those <lb />
					impressions of our Saviours grace, which he <lb />
					had received in his Younger Years when he <lb />
					had been solidly awakened, &amp; obtained a view <lb />
					in Spirit of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> sufferings, which remain- <lb />
					ed unforgetten by him. He however felt <lb />
					great uneasiness of mind, amidst the gaieties <lb />
					&amp; pleasures of the World, which he once disclosed

					to a person of Rank in Russia acquainted with <lb />
					the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> especially with Count Zinzendorff, who <lb />
					spoke to him in and enrcourageng manner, &amp; <lb />
					whose conversation was greatly blessed to him <lb />
					the above mentioned person at the same time <lb />
					related to him several particulars concerning <lb />
					the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> which created a wish in him, <lb />
					to become more nearly acquainted with them. <lb />
					Accordingly in 1739 when he quitted Russia, he <lb />
					resolved to pay a visit to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at Zeist, intend- <lb />
					ing to go from thence to England, to enter into his <lb />
					Majestys Service on board a Westindia Ship. The first <lb />
					meeting he attended at Zeist was a singing meeting <lb />
					during which he was so overpowerd with a feeling of <lb />
					divine Grace, that it was immediately made clear <lb />
					to him that this was the people he belonged to, having <lb />
					always from his infancy had a desire to live among <lb />
					Children of God:, Here he also got acquainted with Count <lb />
					Zinzendorff, who received him very cordially, Never- <lb />
					 theless he for the present, pursued his intentions <lb />
					of proceeding to England, where he engaged as Sur- <lb />
					geon onboord the Monarque in which Station he <lb />
					remained about a Year, during the whole of which <lb />
					time the Vessel lay in the harbours He kept up in <lb />
					the mean time an acquaintance with the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> in <lb />
					London: But the great Wickedness &amp; abandoned <lb />
					life of the Ships crews, to which he was witness was <lb />
					so disgusting to him, that he was glad to obtain <lb />
					his dissmission. After this he lodged for a short time <lb />
					with a B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in London &amp; being desirous of coming <lb />
					into still closer connection with the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>

					went in Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1760 according to their advice to Bedford <lb />
					where he moved into the Single B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> House.</p>
					<p>
					Tho' he had it at first very hard in externals yet he <lb />
					never despaired but was always thankful to our <lb />
					Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> for having brought him thither, &amp; used to express <lb />
					himself to that effect, that he should esteem it the <lb />
					greatest favor to live with Children of God, were he even <lb />
					necessitated to live on Bread &amp; Water. He first engaged <lb />
					with the late Doc. Vowel as a partner in business, but <lb />
					after sometime this partnership was dissolved, &amp; <lb />
					the set up for himself as Surgeon &amp; Apothecary. </p>
					<p>
					He was received in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> April 20 1761 &amp; admitted <lb />
					to the holy Comunion Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 26 in the same Year. </p>
					<p>
					Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1766 he was married to the S. Sister Hanah <lb />
					Scorfield of the Choir House at Fulnec, his present <lb />
					Widow by whom he has had one Daughter, now a <lb />
					member of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at Bedford, He was very success <lb />
					full in his profession, whereby he also proved a bless- <lb />
					ing to many of his patients in their dying mom- <lb />
					ents, was respected in the Town &amp; neighbourhood, <lb />
					&amp; always a steady Friend to the poor even to his own <lb />
					disadvantage. Tho his warm &amp; positive temper <lb />
					&amp; disposition sometimes caused him trouble, <lb />
					Yet his upright Sincere &amp; generous mind pro- <lb />
					cured him many Friends by whom he was much <lb />
					esteemed, The reflection on his past unfaithful- <lb />
					ness to our Saviours Grace, &amp; the powerful sensa- <lb />
					tions he had of his great depravity, caused him <lb />
					indeed many heavy hours, but amidst all this he <lb />
					cleaved as a poor pardoned Sinner to his Redeemer

					&amp; experienced rich comforts from him, which was <lb />
					more especially perceptible in the last years of his <lb />
					Life, when he grew more chearful &amp; happy &amp; resigned <lb />
					His constitution which was naturally strong, <lb />
					had been much impaired by fatiague of body &amp; <lb />
					mind, about 5 Years ago he got a paralitic Stroke <lb />
					which greatly enfeabled him, Since this time he <lb />
					suffered greatly from increasing weakness, which <lb />
					at last brought on a total delay of strength. His <lb />
					present Widow our dear Sister Borck, has shew&apos;n <lb />
					great &amp; unremitting tenderness in faithfully nur- <lb />
					sing him during this long period of illess. Amidst <lb />
					his sufferings which was very great, his patience <lb />
					was exemplary, &amp; he always expressed himself <lb />
					thankful for the least services done him. </p>
					<p>
					When visited his favorite topick was the Love &amp; <lb />
					forbearance of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> so consisintly displayed <lb />
					in the mercy shewn to him, being plucked as <lb />
					a brand out of the fire. Several weeks before <lb />
					his departure it was evident, that he would not <lb />
					continue long here below, from which time <lb />
					forward, his mind seemed wholly disengaged <lb />
					from all earthly cares, &amp; occupied in converse <lb />
					with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, he frequently prayed fervently <lb />
					to him, entreating our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to strengthen him &amp; <lb />
					support him in his trouble, &amp; especially to be <lb />
					near him in his last hours, He once told a <lb />
					Brother who visited him that altho he had the

					full assurance that he should go to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
					as an absolved sinner, yet he could not deny <lb />
					that he felt some dread at the thoughts of the <lb />
					separation of Soul &amp; Body, but some days <lb />
					after he intimated to the same Brother, that <lb />
					he could now say with thanks to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
					that this dread had been entirely removed. <lb />
					A day or two before his departure, he expressed <lb />
					in a very emphatical manner, his thankful <lb />
					ness for having brought him to his ransom&apos;d <lb />
					Congregation &amp; sealed his Salvation. </p>
					<p>
					Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1791 he was no longer able to speak, <lb />
					&amp; from that time lay Still in sweet expectati- <lb />
					on of that blessed moment when his Redeemed <lb />
					Soul should be translated into the mansions <lb />
					of bliss. This favor was granted him about <lb />
					nine oClock the same Evening when he <lb />
					departed softly &amp; happily aged 64 years 11 days </p>
					<p>
					Blessed are the dead, which die in the <lb />
					Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit, <lb />
					that they may rest from their Labour, &amp; <lb />
					their works do follow them. Rev<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> 14. 13
