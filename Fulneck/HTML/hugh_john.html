    <h2>John Hugh</h2>
    <p><a href="#mlper000550.html">John Hugh</a> who Departed <em>May 22d 1772</em> has dictated the folloing concerning his Life</p>
    <p> I was born at <a href="#mlpla000200.html">Frestrup in the Parish of Pembrokshire</a><em>Febr 6<sup>th</sup><br /> 1741</em>, &amp; lived with my Parents till <em>I was 7 years of Age</em>;
      about this <br /> time <a href="#mlper000408.html">B<sup>r</sup> Cennick</a> came into this Country &amp; Preached the Gospel, <br /> my Mother who went frequently to hear him, took me with her
      <br /> which I liked. When a Childrens Meeting was begun, I had the <br />Grace to be one of them who attended it, which proved a blessing<br /> to me, for there I got the first Impression of
      our Sav<sup>rs</sup>Love. </p>
    <p><a href=".html">Esq<sup>r</sup> Roach</a> of <a href=".html">Clarison</a> being a lover of the Gospel &amp; a friend <br /> of Children he settled a School, to which I also was taken, but I
      <br /> having no Genius for learning, did not bring it far, yet by frequent <br /> hearing the Versses out of the little Hymn Book which he had bought <br /> for the Children, I learned many of
      them by heart &amp; delighted in <br /> singing them. Our Master who was a very good Man, used to sing <br /> Verses before &amp; after Meals of which the following made a particular <br />
      Impression upon me: We thank the Lord for this our Food; but more <br /> for <a href=".html">Jesus</a> Flesh &amp; Blood the Manna to the Spirit giv'n the living Bread <br /> sent down from <a
        href=".html">Heav'n</a>. At Nights our Master used to kneel <br /> down with us, &amp; oftens pray'd very heartily that our Sav<sup>r</sup> might <br /> preserve us from every bad thing &amp;
      lead us in the way to everlasting <br /> Life. We Children kept also Meetings among ourselves &amp; when we <br /> went into the Fields, we sometimes kneel'd down under the Hedges &amp; <br />
      pray'd to our Sav<sup>r</sup> in a Childlike simple manner. When I was about <br /><em>12 years of age</em> I went to Service, where I had it very hard, nor did </p>

    <p> I get enough
      to eat. <em>After 2 Years</em> I went to another place, where I <br /> had it better in outward respects, but was much exposed to bad and <br />hurtful Company, so that I lost those good
      Impressions which I had <br /> as a Child, &amp; a Desire for the World &amp; its Vanity took place in me. </p>
    <p> When <em>I was about 19 Years old</em>, one of my former Masters wanted<br /> me to enter again into his Service, with whom I also agreed, &amp; as <br /> I learn'd afterwards, a Scheme was
      laid, that if I had come there, <br /> I very likely should have settled &amp; been entirely lost in the things of <br /> this World; but before the time came quite on, I went to see my <br />
      Mother &amp; Sister, who persuaded me to go &amp; work as a Mason on the <br /> Fortification, which was then to be build, tho' I never had been em- <br /> ploy'd as a Mason before, but I got
      Tools &amp; went, &amp; the Lord to <br /> whom I pray'd, helped me, so that I could go on with the work &amp; there- <br /> by all Dangers, which awaited me, if I had gone again to Service,
      <br /> were prevented. Living now with my Mother, she asked me to go with <br /> her to divine Service, which I did, as I had no particular Choise in <br /> this Respect. After I had been to
      hear <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Nyberg</a> several times he spoke <br /> to me &amp; invited me to call &amp; see him, which I did the Sunday after, when <br /> we had had some Conversation
      together, he told me, that now the <br />Society would have a meeting &amp; I might be present; As soon as I <br /> entered the Room, I was seized with an holy awe &amp; the praying <br /> of
      the Litany in that Meeting made such an Impression upon me <br /> that I not only looked upon them as true Children of <a href=".html">God</a>, but became <br /> also seriously concerned about
      myself. I then went to the Meeting</p>

    <p> every Sunday &amp; in my return, I oftens pray' d to our Sav<sup>r</sup> to <br />make me happy &amp; give me the assurance thereof in my
      heart. <br /> I had still some Difficulties on account of my former Connexions, <br /> but my faithfull Sav<sup>r</sup> help'd me thro' &amp; made me free from them all. <br /> As we lived about
      3 Miles distant from <a href="mlpla000201.html">Haverforthwest</a>, &amp; my <br /> Mother was not so well cared for as I could wish, I took a House <br /> &amp; moved with her to <a
        href="mlpla000201.html">Haverforthwest</a> where we lived happily toge- <br /> ther. <em>May the 12<sup>th</sup> 1765</em> I was received into the Cong<sup>n</sup> which I <br />esteemed very
      highly. In general I have had a very happy time<br /> &amp; had many a Visit from our Sav<sup>r</sup> in the Converse with him; As well <br /> in my Sleeping place, as when I took a walk in the
      Fields &amp; once <br /> in particular when I walked by the River Side, He appeared to my poor <br /> heart &amp; assured me that I should be His &amp; that he has shed his Blood for <br /> all
      my Sins; <em>March 31<sup>st</sup> 1768</em>I was made a partaker of our Lords<br /> Flesh &amp; Blood in the holy Sacrament, Ah! how thankful am I <br /> for all the Grace our Sav<sup>r</sup>
      has bestow'd upon me, how often has He drawn <br /> so near to me, that I have melted into Tears, when I have been praying <br /> or speaking to him, these were happy Times, which I shall never
      forget.</p>
    <p>Thus far his own words.</p>
    <p> When <a href="mlper000027.html">B<sup>r</sup> Petrus</a> was in <a href=".html">Haverforthwest</a>, he desired &amp; obtained leave <br /> to come to <a href="mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>
      &amp; arrived here <em>Augst 28<sup>th</sup> 1768</em>. His course here has <br /> been Edifying &amp; to our Satisfaction, he always expressed a great <br /> Regard for the Cong<sup>n</sup>,
      but when he saw or heard any thing unbecoming <br /> in any one, who lived in the Cong<sup>n</sup>, he did not rightly know how to <br /> take it, yet our Sav<sup>r</sup> always reminded him to
      look to himself &amp; </p>

    <p> to dwell upon the faults of others &amp; thereby farther hurt was <br /> prevented. He oftens expressed a Desire to serve our Sav<sup>r</sup>, &amp; some
      <br /> time before his last Sickness begun; he declared to his Labourer: <br /> That he had devoted himself quite a new to our Sav<sup>r</sup> &amp; his People, <br /> was quite satisfied as
      &amp; where he was at present, but if our Sav<sup>r</sup><br /> would give him a Call to any other place or employ, if he but <br /> knew, it came from Him, he would accept of it with all <br />
      his heart. <em>Last December</em>he got a bad Cold, which turned <br /> to a severe Cough attended with a Hectic Fever. He expressed <br /> a Desire to go to our Sav<sup>r</sup>, but said, that
      he was not clear, if <br /> it would be now. The Medicine he took had but little affect <br /> yet we thought, the warm wheather &amp; some gentle Exercise <br /> might perhaps be a means of his
      recovery, &amp; when it was prac- <br /> ticed, it seemed to have a good effect, so that about 3 weeks ago <br /> he thought still, that he would be able to take a Journey to <a href=".html"
        >Wales</a><br /> &amp; fixed the day for his setting out, which proved to be the day of <br /> his happy Departure. Eight Days ago his Sickness took a turn, <br /> when it appeared, that his
      time here would be but short, &amp; when <br /> the Doctor told him so, he was exceeding glad of it &amp; waited with <br /> resignation for his Desolution; a little before his Departure, a
        <br />B<sup>r</sup> said to him: that now he would soon be with our Savr and appear <br /> before him in his Blood &amp; Righteousness, upon which he answered <br /> Ah! that is pretty, if I
      had no Sav<sup>r</sup>, what should I do now? In this <br />Comfortable Disposition &amp; with a Reconciled hearthe went to his Redeemer<br /> in the <em>31<sup>st</sup> Year of his Age</em>
