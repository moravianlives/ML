               <p>
                  I Sam.l Tippett have thought it might not
                  be amiss to leave the following lines behind me
                  I was Born in the year of our Lord in 1711
                  In the Parrish of Bitton, in the Hamlet of Oland
                  My Father died when I was young, my mother
                  kept me to school tho with some difficulty, For
                  I was of a light turn of mind and giving very
                  much to play with other Boys which made
                  my mother pretty sharp with me, Tho at some
                  times I should have sarious thoughts and think what
                  will become of me when I die and should wish
                  I had never been born or died when I had been
                  at my mothers breast, Then I thought I should
                  went to Heaven, But who knows what will
                  become of me now, I have been such a bad
                  Boy, and told so many lies, and said nasty words,
                  and many of the like thoughts would come into
                  my mind, Then I should think to be better
                  and not do so nomore, and often wish I had
                  one or two little Boys of my mind to go to
                  Church and to be good and to live a Religious
                  life, and did often times wish I had liv'd
                  in the days of our Saviour, and think how
                  I wou'd have lov'd Him and follow'd him
                  had it been even to death, so that when
                  I did Read of His death and sufferings. I should
                  melt into tears, so that I was fors't to give
                  over Reading, although it was the only
                  place that I did love to Read in; But once above
                  all the rest as I was rocking the cradle looking in

               <p>
                  a little Book as I met with by chance I felt
                  something in my Heart that I never felt before,
                  and had it been possible I cou'd then even sunk
                  into nothing in tears of love before the Lord Jesus
                  and the Covenant that I made with Him that
                  evening I though then to have kept to all the days
                  of my Life, But this soon wear'd of, and for want
                  of care taken as I grew biger my corruped
                  nature grew stronger and stronger and led me more
                  and more captive, at Ten years of age or these
                  about I went to work in the Coal Pitt
                  amongs't other other bad Boys, though my Mother
                  porswade my to go a Prentis but I cou'd
                  not bear the though of loosing my
                  companion, and be confind, But as I grew
                  in years older and older at last I thought
                  to make my self happy in what the
                  world called merry company, But twas
                  all in vain, for I was disapointed in
                  every thing that I did take in hand,
                  So that often times in the midts of
                  mirth I should have such heaviness
                  of spirit come upon me that I did
                  not know what to do, some times I did
                  endeavour to pass it away by singing
                  or Dancing or such like, and some times
                  leave my company, and think if I was with
               </p>

               <p>
                  with other company then perhaps i should
                  be better satisfied, but this would not do
                  for twas all in vain, for when i was coming
                  home my heart would begin to smite me.
                  thinking where have i been and what will
                  become of me if i go on at this rate,
                  then i should make many resolutions not
                  to do no more of beg of lord to forgive 
                  me, but in a few days all my resolutions
                  would be broken and i should think it is
                  fine enough if for me to turn may
                  live a great while, i am but young if
                  as my father died in of consumption
                  to may i an then it will be time
                  enough to represent if turn to the lord
                  but this would not satisfy my poor 
                  mind long together, for when my thoughts
                  of dying suddenly or being killed in 
                  if did come in mind i did not know
                  what to do, but should beg of lord to spare
                  me a little longer, for i could not bear 
                  thoughts of leaving world in of 
                  condition i was then in, this i went on
                  for many years together sinning if responding
                  striving to get happiness in my pleasures
                  of this life is positive but i was all in 
                  vain, for i was disappointed in all my
               </p>

               <p>
                  ways that I did think to get happiness in,
                  abought this time I goot aguainted
                  with my dear wife and was maried into the
                  year 1736 by whome I have had Eleven
                  Children, For the first two years and more
                  I went on in my old cource of life
                  with my merry Company thinking by &amp;
                  by it will be better, but I new not how
                  for I was disapointed in every thing and
                  all that I took in hand seem'd to make
                  against me; that I knew not which
                  way I shou'd come through in the world
                  about this time Mr. Whitfield came
                  in these parts and I went to hear him
                  at a place cal'd Hannam Mount, He spoke
                  of the Prodigal son returning to his Father
                  and of our fall by nature and how willing
                  Jesus Christ was to receive every returning
                  sinner, He painted my case and condition as
                  tho he new me from the very bottom, and
                  envited all such poor sinners to Jesus Christ
                  in a loving manner, I thought this was
                  to good news to be believ'd that ever he
                  cou'd receive or look upon such a poor reck
                  as I was who had been fighting against him
               </p>
            </div>

               <p>
                  all the days of my life, But this seem'd as
                  a Hook in my Heart for some days, Tho
                  I was asham'd to let any one know anything
                  about it, But I thought if this be true there
                  is nothing in all the world shall hinder me
                  till I know he have receiv'd me, if he will
                  except of the such a poor sinner as I am, soon
                  after this hear'd Mr Sennick under the secumore
                  Tree near Mr Wesleys scool it being the first or
                  second time of his preaching, But I had not
                  been there many minutes but my heart was
                  all most ready to break, He spoke from the
                  first chapter of Saint John and something of
                  his own experience which came near my
                  heart thinking to my self what shall I do
                  to be sav'd, my sins as if weare steard me in
                  the face, my companians and all I thought wou'd
                  be witness against me at the Last Day, and
                  as I had not been the ruination of my own
                  poor soul but theirs also, and now I was a
                  mark for every one to laugh at, and many
                  more of the like expression was the languige
                  of my poor heart for the whole sermon
                  I stood in amaze asham'd to look anyone in
                  the face thinking no ones condition like mine

                  went to Bristol and I inquired where he lied and
                  got him over to Kingswood with us that night,
                  He slept at my House and I never thought my
                  self so happy in all my former compoany as I did
                  when I was along with him, if often
                  did on bosom my mind into him as my only
                  friend, but about this time I heard Mr Wesloy
                  preach up a self denial life, how we should live
                  and walk which put me to work I caused me
                  many akin heart after word, so that I did
                  often times with I could never eat drink nor
                  sleep no more until I did know the Lord Jesus did
                  love me I had forgiven me my sins, then
                  I was confirmed went to the sacrament
                  thinking to find ease there, but I found it
                  quite to the contrary, for this added to my
                  trouble that I was more condonned than ever
                  thinking no ones condition like mine
                  in the whole world,tossed  to and forget
                  rest for my poor heart but could find
                  none, and was often times making of
                  resolutions to get into the woods, or to some
                  retired place where I might spend the
                  rest of my days and never eat nor drink
                  no more till I did know that Jesus Christ did love
                  me, but in this I was also disappointed for go
                  where I would if uneasiness of my heart and the
                  thoughts of leaving this world that know
                  I should be saved would make me in such a

                  condition that I did not know what to do with myself.
                  The some times in midst of all although
                  would dash into my mind, who knows but I shall
                  be said at last, perhaps if Lord do love me
                  he have promised to save such ones as in my
                  condition therefore I will never rest free
                  I know that he have said me, about this time
                  I and four more was taken into a band by Mr Connick at Mr Wesloy, scool where we
                  met constant together every week for some
                  time I not without a lifeliving, about this time
                  I was very near like to be killed two or three times
                  in the pitt and by some other accident, if one of the
                  times my hurt was pretty bad not I thought
                  has spard my life if not called me away in the condition
                  I was then in though of if same time I did
                  not know that any one had any thing to
                  righteous life, I fasted two or three times
                  every week, I prayed perhaps ten or twenty times
                  every day as after as I had opportunity, I went
                  to my sacrament every month, Every hour
                  that I did steps I did think twas time lost,
                  and did often times wish I could never sleep
                  no more, my countenance did betray my poor
                  miserable heart, some times with heats a sigh
                  would bust from my heart O that I did but
                  know if Lord Jesus, or was afraid of his love

                  to my poor heart, though sometimes
                  between while a thought would dart into
                  my mind who knows but I shall be saved at
                  last perhaps jesus do love me. if one promise
                  after another would come into my mind
                  that my very heart would leap for day
                  but soon after i should give all over and
                  think it was something of my own
                  making and getting into my old course of duties
                  as before, till at last i was a weary
                  of my left righteous life, for if more i
                  did strive of faster i was so that i did not
                  love to hear so much of simple doings
                  for i found it was all nothing but stuff
                  and with a full determination thought 
                  if i porrith i will porrith at of feel of 
                  jesus as a poor sinner, for i was a sensible
                  that nothing could satisfy my poor heart
                  but Him, and about this time as I was in
                  a coal pitt making my complaint to if
                  Lord Jesus as I use to do had i but a minute
                  time, but all of a sudden it was as though
                  he spoke to me i am could if do love thee
                  but what if i felt in my heart that moment words
                  who felt in my hear that moment words all my uneasiness of
                  heart was gone in a moment, and Him
                  whom i looked upon before as being angry with me i found was my best friend
                  in the whole world that it been possible i could then.

                  even sunk into nothing or went home
                  to him that very moment, this lasted upon
                  and down with me for some time until the wickedness
                  of my Heart began to appear, which made me think
                  I had decieved myself, though at times I did feel
                  to the contract I could not give it up, about this
                  as perfection reprobation and and if like which put
                  me to reasoning often times made me uneasy
                  in my mind whom I did enter upon them, we
                  had several meetings to try to reconcile it
                  but to no purpose, for in a little time Brother
                  Connick and twenty four more of us was put out
                  along with him out of the society, we went to
                  look a little room where we did meet together
                  every evening and had a pretty feeling amongst
                  us, until at last our number increased so fast
                  that the place we had taken was to little to hold
                  us so that when we had a love feast for
                  want the room we was forced to keep it in
                  the open fields and the spirit of love was felt
                  amongst us, so that many of those that
                  did stand of at distance at the outside
                  of hedges that did not belong to us did
                  not go away without a blessing, but as
                  winter was coming on Brother Connick was 
                  resould to build a school house, bought a piece
                  of ground and had it covered before winter
                  though there was many operations made

                  against it, there is together in love
                  and our saviour was other times feeling in my mind
                  we was soon form'd into classes or bands by 
                  who we look'd upon as our chief
                  labourer that went in and out before you, my
                  heart felt well at that time so that i could
                  keep band with our saviour as though there 
                  was but he and i in of whole world, but some
                  time after this brethren cennik plan began
                  to get wider in Willtshear of many other 
                  places, so that he could not be so much at 
                  kingswood as before so that many others was in place
                  when he was absent, the enemy seeing that 
                  we was like to come to something soon found
                  out away to put a stop to our happiness
                  by something up dochins of many other truths
                  an of place of Jesus Christ this offer 
                  times make me heavy if conserved when 
                  i began to see what confusion was 
                  creeping in amongst us, but in ye
                  year i went to london with br connick
                  there i heard brother gomball, rogers,
                  hutton, it was in some of brother company
                  several times while i stayed there which
                  often times made me wish to see your spirit
                  of love and hearing of kingswood as i say 
                  was amongst them, but after i came home
                  instead of seeing it better it grew worse

                  if worse, so that our number which was in the
                  society of about 80 or so was soon reduced
                  to 50 or so, this caused me pain, and made
                  me make my complain to our savior
                  as though there was but he and I in the
                  whole world, out reaching was all dropped
                  and I knew not what if end of it would
                  be, then I with the consent of 2 or 3 more
                  wrote to Brother and begged that they would
                  come and labour among'st us, and their
                  answer was get they did not see their
                  call quite clear from our savior
                  but so soon as they did they would gladly
                  run to our assistance, four or five brother
                  of us met together every sunday morning
                  making our complaint- one to another
                  and our dear saviour was often times near our
                  hearts, and sunday afternoon our little
                  society of about 20 or 30 did meet together and thus we
                  went on together for sometime, being
                  look'd upon as a stubborn people that
                  a mark for every one to laugh at
                  as for my own part i meet with many
                  trials on every ride, my nearest kindred
                  was set against me and those that before
                  was my bosom friends forsook me and look'd 
                  upon me with disdain, this and many more

                  Complaint to the Lord Jesus, Looking
                  upon my self as having no friend in the
                  whole world but Him to make my
                  complaint to and had not his dear nearness
                  often times comforted my Poor Heart I could not have
                  come through in these troublesome times, 
                  I continu'd writing to the Brethren as often as
                  Opportunity arriv'd because it was so in
                  my Heart could I but be under their
                  came I should be then in my right place,
                  In the years 46 Mr Steele one of the Brethren came
                  to Kingswood &amp; Preach'd in Cennicks Scool
                  House, &amp; in my Evening I {ac}cept a Harty
                  Band with him conserning the many things
                  that had happen'd amongs't us, But just
                  after I parted from him not far from
                  the place where our Chapple stands
                  I had such a feeling of our Saviours
                  Love that I stood still in amaze{ment}
                  &amp; said Dear Savior how is this that I 
                  feel in my Heart so much Love to these
                  People power'd out my whole Heart to 
                  Him in a child like manner &amp; pray'd

                  That I say was comin upon me, Soon
                  after this Mr Horn which was the labourer at
                  Wilshearcame &amp; Preach'd twice in Cennick
                  school, and I felt my Heart united to Him
                  &amp; tould him the many disputes that had been a-
                  mongst us, And our Saviour blessed our conversation
                  that it was as though a Burden had been
                  taken from me, or as a prisoner set
                  free Especially when he told me as I
                  might look upon my self as under their
                  care &amp; that our saviour had made it out
                  that they should come once a month &amp; 
                  labour amongs't us, this was agreeable
                  news to me, &amp; to many of those that did
                  meet along with me, But in a few weeks 
                  Them that had left us disputed about 
                  Cennciks right to the school because 
                  He was gone to the Brethren &amp; took it away
                  by violence without Brother Cennicks knowing
                  any thing about i , Then after that was
                  taken away from us we remov'd to Brother
                  Cennicks own house where his sister then 
                  lived, &amp; though our company was but small
                  yet we had many pretty opportunities to the
                  satisfaction of many Heart, But the Enemy 
                  not willing to leave no stone onturn'd soon

                  found out away to drive us from there also,
                  then by of advice of Mr Horn, if to that
                  did alright us from wilshear we removed
                  meetings to my own house where we 
                  continued for some time with many 
                  blessings, and in a year we
                  was visited by many of our Joannas
                  Nichman, Bealer, Marshall, Colast, Horn
                  Connicks of many others by whom 
                  my heart was refreshed if  comforted
                  many a time about this time my
                  mother went home she was one of our society and she expressed her
                  happiness to one of our sister of 
                  right before, which was last that

                  of consent of the Brother we removed our
                  meeting into her House, where we
                  continued for some years, and though
                  it was but a little house and our company
                  small yet our saviour's sweet nearness
                  was felt amongst us which did often
                  make my poor heart blush for shame,
                  and allow hardily do I with this happy

                  Feeling to all those that are taken 
                  up with so many things besides Jesus
                  Christ, and as yet do not see Him the one 
                  thing need full, In the year 1754 the Disciple
                  came to Bristoll wherein I had an
                  opportunity to tell Him how I felt my
                  Heart towards the Brethren for many years 
                  past, and that I was willing to cast 
                  my lot with them above all people
                  in the whole world, He tould me I should &amp; 
                  accordingly gave me leave to write to him
                  when he return'd to London, There in
                  I expres't my mind more fuller, some-
                  time after then I had leave to go to 
                  London &amp; to be at the Synod at Chelsy House
                  which proved a blessing to my heart &amp;
                  at times I shall never forget what I say
                  heard &amp; felt, Heare I must stop with
                  a blushing face before our saviour
                  &amp; thank him with a thousand Tears
                  that ever twas my lot to be brought 
                  to those people who preach the Torments
                  of Jesus, whose lives is not dear to them
                  so they can but bring souls to him &amp; be
                  Happy, January the 26th 1755 the Congregation

                  was setl'd at Bristoll a Day that I
                  long'd with to see for many years,
                  and had my lot to be one amongs't the rest
                  This was a Day that had it been possible
                  I cou'd have sunk into nothing for shame
                  and unworthiness before my Dear
                  Savior who have done so much for
                  me &amp; brought me to His people at last
                  with home I am determined to spend the 
                  rest of my days was it at the loss of
                  all things or let the consequence be what 
                  it will, so I have good but his sweet
                  nearness to support me thats enough for
                  me, In the following year August the 22
                  {17}56 it was agreed upon to have a 
                  Chappell &amp; Burring Ground at Kingwood
                  which I had often times wish to see
                  before I went home, and accordinly
                  he have granted my request in that
                  and many things more for which I thank
                  Him Hartilly and now what my poor
                  Heart have felt in that place I wish
                  to all those that shall hear my dear brethren

                  After my decease, For I wish well to
                  His cause poor &amp; needy as I am, and do
                  Daily pray that I may have him near my
                  poor heart while I am hear, For I have
                  no friend in this world that I can unburden
                  my mind to as I can write him, for the older 
                  i get the more trouble I meet with, so that
                  I have more need of him now then ever and
                  do often times wish that I could lose myself
                  in his company &amp; never dispart from him
                  no more, For when i feel his sweet nearness
                  I want nothing else but to be lost in Him
                  and the outward circumstances &amp; family affairs
                  have taken up to much of my time &amp; caused 
                  me pain, yet my best friend is faithfull 
                  unto me, &amp; in his due time will put all these 
                  things to right, In the meantime while I am
                  hear below may that be my chief concern
                  to have him near my poor Heart in my 
                  old years &amp; then it will all end well
