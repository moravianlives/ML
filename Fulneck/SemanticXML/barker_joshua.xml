						<persName ref="#mlper000555">Joshua Barker</persName> was born in the Year <date type="birth" when-iso="1696-12-22">1696, on the 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> of
							December</date> at <placeName>Hopton</placeName> in the <placeName ref="#mlpla000059">Parish of Mirfield</placeName> he lived with his Father till <date when-iso="1715">19
							Years of Age</date> at which time he was put <name occupation="apprentice">Apprentice</name> to a <name occupation="clothier">Broad-Clothier</name> in that neighborhood, he
						was <name event="marriage">married</name> to his present Widow the <date when-iso="1719-07-13">13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of July 1719</date> by whom he has had 8 Childrn
						two of whom went home in their Infancy and one at Mans Estate and of the 5 survising ones, one Son is a member of our Society, he liv&apos;d happily with his Wife and being of
						a religious turn he went with his Wife constantly to the <placeName>Church</placeName> &amp; <name event="sacrament">Sacrament</name>, and had religious Meetings kept in his
						house where they us&apos;d to pray and read <title>Burkets Exposition</title> on the <name type="religious">new Testament</name>; his self working was for some time in his way,
						so that to be a poor Sinner at the feet of <persName type="deity">Jesus</persName> was a hard matter to him for some time, and he was a long time among the <orgName>B<hi
								rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> before he got a feeling of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> Dying Love in his heart.
						When <persName ref="#mlper000536">Mr Ingham</persName> preach&apos;d in the Beginning in these parts he went to hear him, his Wife at first was against it; but upon her hearing
						both <persName><roleName>B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Ockertshausen</persName> at her own house her Prejudice dropt away and they <add place="above">both</add>
						went both together, he always had a great attachment to the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>, and upon the his Land Lords being against the Preaching at his
						house, he rather left it than comply with his Desire not to let the <name type="religious">Gospel</name> be preach&apos;d there. He soon became a Member of our
							<orgName>Society</orgName>, and had the Grace to be <name event="reception">receiv&apos;d</name> on the <date when-iso="1752-04-22">22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of April
							1752</date> into the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> &amp; <date when-iso="1752-11-19">Nov. 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> in the
							same year</date> he partook of the highest Good in the <name event="sacrament">holy Sacrament</name> for the first time. Within these 2 Years he has occasionally said to
						his Wife I shall not be long here but shall soon be go home, but don&apos;t be troubled for you will not stay long after me. At the regulating of the Bands and Classes anew in
							<date when-iso="1760-01">January 1760</date> he became a <name office="bond_servant">Bond Servant</name>, in which capacity he was a faithfull Helper &amp; belov&apos;d by
						his <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>, and found a Blessing for his own heart. On <date when-iso="1760-11-10">Monday night the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							of November</date> he was taken with a <name health="disease">violent and pain- full Disorder</name> so that his Disolution was expected before morning, the Vio- lence of
						which was however somewhat abated the next Day when he was visited by <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Watson</persName> on his
						return from <placeName>Huddersfield</placeName>. He was very chearfull notwithstanding his great bodily Pain &amp; in a sinnerlike Connexion with the man of Sorrows, whom he
						said he longed to see face to face, &amp; beg&apos;d him and the <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>n</roleName> to bear him on their hearts, before Him
						on that account. From his first becoming sick he always thought he should yet Permission to leave his mortal Tent, and from hence be taken the faithfull one to see, at which he
						frequently rejoic&apos;d in his heart, &amp; speaking with a Brother of the great Long- ing he felt to be at home with his wounded Friend that only matchless <note

					<p> Heart and observing his Wife looked thoughtfull, he said to her when I am with him I will speak a good Word for you, that he may soon fetch you also and I&apos;m sure he will
						not deny me my Request and this he comforted her about their parting. Soon after the <name event="sacrament">Sacrament</name>, being visited by a B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						he express&apos;d his great Longing for that highest Good, in order to strengthen his heart under the great bodily pain he felt and declared that the better Death and Passion
						of the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>
						<persName>Jesus</persName> was what his heart rely&apos;d upon and his its only Good for time &amp; Eternity. Once being visited he express&apos;d his Desire to be buried with
						his <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> at <placeName>Lambs Hill</placeName> and seemed grieved that on account of his outward Circumstances he must give up that
						hope but he was soon comforted upon our assuring him we wou&apos;d see to it that his desire shou&apos;d be accomplish&apos;d. <date when-iso="1761-01-21">Jan 21<hi
								rend="superscript">st</hi></date> he had his part of the <name event="sacrament">holy Sacramen</name>t with some other sick for which End he came on Horse- back <del>to
							the</del> to the <placeName>Chapel</placeName> which was the last time of his being there. On the <name type="holiday">Great Sabbath</name>
						<persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Watson</persName> carried him the <name event="sacrament">Sacram<hi rend="superscript"
							>t</hi></name>, and first related <add place="above">to him</add> what <del>had</del> had pass&apos;d in the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript"
							>n</hi></orgName> at <placeName>G.H</placeName>. on Maunday Thursday and then <add place="above">in a</add> child- like <del>Prayer</del> Prayer beg&apos;d that mouth which
						spoke his own clean, to speak this <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> who could not enjoy the Application of the bloody Gore from his Back in
							y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Aeditarium on account of Sickness clean, and to hasten the ripening of this fruit of his Deaths Agony &amp; take him home to himself or soon
						enable him to appear again among his <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>. Then he sung: What <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> thee so tormented &amp;c.
						O led him in thy nail holes see his Pardon &amp; Election free &amp;c. Give him absolution, and a gentle praising Tone, deep Foundation in thy Cross&apos;s Stem, and then
						during an inexpressible tender &amp; melting feeling he receiv&apos;d his share of the <name event="sacrament">holy Sacram<hi rend="superscript">t</hi></name> after which he
						was particularly chearfull and happy and frequently said to his Wife, now I have got what I wanted, and seem&apos;d highly blessed. That Night was a very painfull night to him
						and his <name health="disease">Disorder very became again</name> very vio- lent. On Monday being visited by one of the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> to
						whom he again signified his Longing to be at home which Desire was granted him the next day in the Evening about 8o&apos;clock after having lain quiet &amp; still from about
						4o&apos;clock with- out speaking, he sweetly fell asleep &amp; grew pale on <persName type="deity">Jesus</persName> arm &amp; Bosom, in y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 65<hi
							rend="superscript">th</hi> year of his dying Life, with that Childrens Watch Word; all that are in the Graves shall hear his voice. Now there&apos;s no Soul who doth not
