						<persName ref="#mlper000550">John Hugh</persName> who Departed <date when-iso="1772-05-22">May 22d 1772</date> has dictated the <hi rend="underline">folloing concerning his
							Life</hi></p>
					<p> I was born at <placeName>Frestrup</placeName> in the <placeName>Parish of Pembrokshire</placeName>
						<date when-iso="1741-02-06">Febr 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1741</date>, &amp; lived with my Parents till <date when-iso="1748" cert="medium">I was 7 years of Age</date>;
						about this time <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Cennick</persName> came into this Country &amp; Preached the Gospel, my Mother
						who went frequently to hear him, took me with her which I liked. When a <name event="religious">Childrens Meeting</name> was begun, I had the Grace to be one of them who
						attended it, which proved a <name type="emotion">blessing to me</name>, for there I got the first Impression of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>rs</hi></roleName> Love. <persName><roleName type="honorific">Esq<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Roach</persName> of <placeName>Clarison</placeName> being a lover
						of the Gospel &amp; a friend of Children he settled a School, to which I also was taken, but I having no Genius for learning, did not bring it far, yet by frequent hearing the
						Versses out of the little Hymn Book which he had bought for the Children, I learned many of them by heart &amp; <name type="emotion">delighted in singing them</name>. Our
						Master who was a very good Man, used to sing Verses before &amp; after Meals of which the following made a particular Impression upon me: We thank the <roleName
							type="honorific">Lord</roleName> for this our Food; but more for <persName type="deity">Jesus</persName> Flesh &amp; Blood the Manna to the Spirit giv&apos;n the living
						Bread sent down from <placeName type="biblical">Heav&apos;n</placeName>. At Nights our Master used to kneel down with us, &amp; oftens pray&apos;d very heartily that our
							<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> might preserve us from every bad thing &amp; lead us in the way to everlasting Life. We Children kept
						also Meetings among ourselves &amp; when we went into the Fields, we sometimes kneel&apos;d down under the Hedges &amp; pray&apos;d to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> in a Childlike simple manner. When I was about <date when-iso="1753" cert="medium">12 years of age</date> I went to <name
							event="religious">Service</name>, where I had it very hard, nor did </p>

					<p> I get enough to eat. <date when-iso="1755" cert="medium">After 2 Years</date> I went to another place, where I had it better in outward respects, but was much exposed to bad
						and hurtful Company, so that I lost those good Impressions which I had as a Child, &amp; a Desire for the World &amp; is Vanity took place in me. When <date when-iso="1760"
							cert="medium">I was about 19 Years old</date>, one of my former Masters wanted me to enter again into his Service, with whom I also agreed, &amp; as I learn&apos;d
						afterwards, a Scheme was laid, that if I had come there, I very likely should have settled &amp; been entirely lost in the things of this World; but before the time came quite
						on, I went to see my Mother &amp; Sister, who persuaded me to go &amp; work as a <name occupation="mason">Mason</name> on the Fortification, which was then to be build,
						tho&apos; I never had been employ&apos;d as a <name occupation="mason">Mason</name> before, but I got Tools &amp; went, &amp; the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> to
						whom I pray&apos;d, helped me, so that I could go on with the work &amp; there by all Dangers, which awaited me, if I had gone again to Service, were prevented. Living now with
						my Mother, she asked me to go with her to <name event="religious">divine Service</name>, which I did, as I had no particular Choise in this Respect. After I had been to hear
								<persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Nyberg</persName> several times he spoke to me &amp; invited me to call &amp; see him,
						which I did the Sunday after, when we had had some Conversation together, he told me, that now the <orgName>Society</orgName> would have a meeting &amp; I might be present; As
						soon as I entered the Room, I was seized with <name type="emotion">an holy awe</name> &amp; the praying of the Litany in that Meeting made such an Impression upon me that I not
						only looked upon them as true Children of <persName type="deity">God</persName>, but became also seriously concerned about myself. I then went to the <name event="religious"
							>Meeting</name>

					<p> every Sunday &amp; in my return, I oftens pray&apos; d to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> to <name type="emotion">make me happy &amp;
							give me the assurance thereof in my heart</name>. I had still some Difficulties on account of my former Connexions but my faithfull <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> help&apos;d me thro&apos; &amp; made me free from them all . As we lived about 3 Miles distant from
							<placeName>Haverforthwest</placeName>, &amp; my Mother was not so well cared for as I could wish, I took a House &amp; moved with her to
							<placeName>Haverforthwest</placeName> where we lived happily together. <date when-iso="1765-05-12">May the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1765</date> I was <name
							event="reception">received</name> into the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> which I esteemed very highly. In general <name
							type="emotion">I have had a very happy time</name> &amp; had many a Visit from our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> in the Converse
						with him; As well in my Sleeping place, as when I took a walk in the Fields &amp; once in particular when I walked by the River Side, He appeared to my poor heart &amp; assured
						me that I should be His &amp; that he has shed his Blood for all my Sins; <date when-iso="1768-03-31">March 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1768</date> I was made a partaker
						of our <roleName type="honorific">Lords</roleName> Flesh &amp; Blood in the <name event="sacrament">holy Sacrament</name>, Ah! how thankful mn I for all the Grace our <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> has bestow&apos;d upon me, how often has He drawn so near to me, that I have melted into Tears, when I have
						been praying or speaking to him, these were happy Times, which I shall never forget.</p>
					<p>Thus far his own words.</p>
					<p> When <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Petrus</persName> was in <placeName>Haverforthwest</placeName>, he desired &amp; obtained
						leave to come to <placeName ref="mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName> &amp; arrived here <date when-iso="1768-08-28">Augst 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1768</date>. His course
						here has been Edifying &amp; to our Satisfaction, he always expressed a great Regard for the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, but when he
						saw or heard any thing unbecoming in any one, who lived in the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, he did not rightly know how to take it,
						yet our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> always reminded him to look to himself &amp; </p>

					<p> to dwell upon the faults of others &amp; thereby farther hurt was prevented. He oftens expressed a Desire to serve our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></roleName>, &amp; some time before his <name health="disease">last Sickness</name> begun; he declared to his Labourer: That he had devoted himself quite a new
						to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> &amp; his People, was quite satisfied as &amp; where he was at present, but if our <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> would give him a Call to any other place or employ, if he but knew, it came from Him, he would accept of it
						with all his heart. <date when-iso="1771-12">Last December</date>
						<name health="disease" type="cold">he got a bad Cold</name>, which turned to a <name health="disease" type="fever">severe Cough attended with a Hectic Fever</name>. He
						expressed a Desire to go to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>, but said, that he was not clear, if it would be now. The Medicine he
						took had but little affect yet we thought, the warm wheather &amp; some gentle Exercise might perhaps be a means of his recovery, &amp; when it was prac- ticed, it seemed to
						have a good effect, so that about 3 weeks ago he thought still, that he would be able to take a Journey to <placeName>Wales</placeName> &amp; fixed the day for his setting out,
						which proved to be the day of his happy Departure. Eight Days ago his Sickness took a turn, when it appeared, that his time here would be but short, &amp; when the <name
							occupation="doctor" memoirSubject="no">Doctor</name> told him so, he was exceeding glad of it &amp; waited with resignation for his Desolution; a little before his
						Departure, a <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> said to him: that now he would soon be with our <roleName type="honorific">Savr</roleName> and
						appear before him in his Blood &amp; Righteousness, upon which he answered Ah! that is pretty, if I had no <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName>, what should I do now? In this Comfortable Disposition &amp; with a Reconciled heart he went to his <roleName type="honorific">Redeemer</roleName> in the
							<date when-iso="1772" cert="medium" type="death">31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Year of his Age</date>. </p>
