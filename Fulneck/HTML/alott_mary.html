      <h2>Mary Alott</h2>
      <p><a href="#mlper000217.html">Mary Alott</a><br></br> Was born at <a href="#mlpla000100.html">Barksland in the Parish of <br></br> Elland</a>. On the <em>12<sup>th</sup> of Dec<sup>r</sup> 1734 N S.</em></p>
      <p> When <em>she was about Three years old</em> her <br></br> Father dyed &amp; she liv'd with her Mother &amp; <br></br> her Aunt (Namely <a href=".html">Betty Midgley</a>) who <br></br> jointly Nurs'd &amp; Maintain'd <sup>her</sup> till <em>she was
            							<br></br> about seven</em>, then her Mother being again <br></br> Married her Aunt left them took a Room <br></br> &amp; design'd to live by herself, But <sup>Mary</sup> not being <br></br> at all willing to be left behind often begg'd<br></br> her Aunt to take her with her, which <br></br> according<sup>ly</sup> in a few weeks after she Willlingly <br></br> did, &amp; Cared for her as her own. </p>
      <p> When <em>she was about Nine years old</em> she <br></br> by the Drawing of the Holy Ghost was inclin'd <br></br>
         						to hear the Gospel which she of her own free <br></br> accord begun &amp; Continued Constantly to do. </p>
      <p> Some time after her Aunt had a mind for <br></br> the more Convenince of hearing the B<sup>rn</sup><br></br> to live nearer <a href="#mlpla000122.html">Smith House</a> &amp; she made it <br></br> out with the Brethren that <a href="#mlper000217.html">Mary</a> should also <br></br> come &amp; remain with her which she was very <br></br> glad off. </p>
      <p> In <em>July 1748</em> they Both of them together got <br></br>leave to live with the Single Sisters in <a href="#mlpla000097.html">Clack-
            								<br></br> Heaton</a> &amp; she remain'd there &amp; in the same <br></br>Oconomy at <a href="#mlpla000098.html">Tyre-sell-Hall</a> till we came <br></br> in the <a href=".html">Choir
            							House</a> (Which I shall take <br></br> Notice of afterwards) </p>
      <p><em>In the year 1751 on the 5<sup>th</sup> of April</em> she <br></br> was receiv'd in the Congregation which Pleas'd</p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> her very much. <em>In 1753 on the 25 of February</em><br></br> she after many a Heartywish &amp; Earnestlonging<br></br> for it was addmitted to the Lords Supper<br></br><em>In the same year</em> was Receiv'd from the Great Girls<br></br> to the Single Sisters Choir. </p>
      <p> She has since about 10, or 11, Years Old, <br></br> carried about a Very Sickly &amp; Weakly Tabernacle<br></br> which she bore without Complaint, &amp; being of an <br></br> exceeding shill quiet, but also very
         						solid &amp; <br></br> sensible <del>Dispossition</del> she was seldom <br></br> heard to speak about any thing except when <br></br> spoken to: But however as we now have found she
         						<br></br> took good Notice of ever thing &amp; Ponder<sup>'d</sup> them in <br></br> her Heart. </p>
      <p><em>In February this present year</em>she had the <br></br> Small-Pox which not only went very hardly <br></br> with her But also left that remaining on her <br></br> which Render'd her Much
         						more Weak &amp; Sickly <br></br> than before a Consumption appearing thro' her <br></br> Whole Constitution: It was manifest to all about her <br></br> she could not hold it out long,
         						tho she herself wo'd <br></br> commonly say when ask'd about it "that she was <br></br>pretty well Nevertheless what she inwardly felt <br></br> Brought her <sup>also</sup> upon the thoughts &amp; consideration <br></br>
         						of going to Our Saviour (as she afterward, de- <br></br> clar'd with Joy.) </p>
      <p><em>In July</em> she was a little Better but the disor- <br></br> der Presently return'd more strong than ever: <br></br> Yet she continued to walk
         						about till the 22d of <br></br> November, then she entirely took her to her <br></br> Room &amp; soon after to her Bed. </p>
      <p> Now she freely acknowledgeing that she <br></br> had all this summer last, been in a Continual <br></br> meditation &amp; Consultation with her Dear Saviour</p>
      <p> about her going to him, having <sup>all</sup> along been Senscible <br></br> of it for herself that she should not stay here <br></br> but the Reason why she would not
         						confess it <br></br>openly was because she was affraid she should <br></br> not go as soon as she wish'd
         						for. </p>
      <p>She was now exceeding Bad, but quite Brisk<br></br>in <sup>her</sup> Spirits &amp; chearfulin Heart &amp; Soul, &amp; as before <br></br> even Ever since we have known her she has <br></br> been us'd to speak very little, so Now to the Con-
         						<br></br> trary, <sup>she</sup> spoke a great deal especialy to these <br></br> with whom she had had an intimiate acquaintance <br></br> &amp; Perticularly with Our dear
         							<a href="#mlper000702.html">Sister Mary</a><br></br> who very faithfully visited her all the time </p>
      <p><em>On the 12<sup>th</sup></em> instant she had her Birth-Day <br></br> (being 20; years old,) when many Sisters who vis- <br></br>
         						ited her Express'd their Heartywishes for her <br></br> which she receiv'd, &amp; answer'd with much satis- <br></br> faction: In the afternoon her
         						Class made <br></br> her a Very Pretty Love-Feast which rejoic- <br></br> ed her Exceedingly
         						&amp; in which she spoke of <br></br> her Departure with such Pleasure &amp; Delight<br></br> as she never had done before; she spoke with <br></br><a href="#mlper000702.html">sister Mary</a> &amp; Made out Ev'ry thing that was in <br></br> her Mind about
         						her Burial, as well as all <br></br> the Heartywishes &amp; desiresof her heart for <br></br> her Class &amp; c. In short she said that this had <br></br> been to her the Happiest
         						day she ever had <br></br> had in all her life. This day &amp; forward she <br></br> unbosom'd &amp; declar'd what she had (Perhaps) <br></br> kept Treasur'd up in her Heart to this
         						Opper- <br></br> tunity for some years Past, She spoke of her <br></br> various Troubles &amp; Anxieties in
         						Particular Circum- </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> Circumstances, such as no body had perciev'd on her <br></br> with <del>with</del> a Chearful &amp; ThankfulHeart, being <br></br> bowed with Shame before him will whom she <br></br> had spent many happy
         						Moments, days &amp; years </p>
      <p><em>About the 15<sup>th</sup></em> it being Two years since <br></br> we came in <sup>our</sup><a href=".html">Choir House</a> she told <a href="#mlper000702.html">Sister Mary</a><br></br> Ev'rything how she had been &amp; was in <a href="#mlpla000098.html">Tyre- <br></br> sell-Hall</a> at that time, What Anxiety &amp; <br></br>Concern she felt about coming in the <a href=".html">Choir House</a><br></br>fearing Least she should not have leave to <br></br> come &amp; how she had in Shillness Pray'd &amp; wept<br></br> before her dear Lamb, that he would give <br></br> her Leave to come &amp; that if she should have <br></br> that favour that he would
         						grant her the feel- <br></br> ing &amp; nearness of his Wounds that she might <br></br> be faithful to him therein &amp;c. Nay his almost <br></br> incredible, how quick &amp; active
         						her Memory <br></br> was over this matter she not only gave <a href="#mlper000702.html">Sis<sup>r</sup><br></br> Mary</a> an account of herself but of all the <br></br> Sisters in Tyre-sell-Hall at that time, she <br></br> (unperceiv'd) had taken Notice of ev'ry
         						One, <br></br> conduct words &amp; behaviour, But to return <br></br> she also Express'd herself in a very Lively<br></br> manner with grace &amp; Understanding how<br></br> Exceedingly she was Rejoiced when she was <br></br> assured she should come here. She at the <br></br> same time viz' the 15<sup>th</sup> or 16<sup>th</sup> Instant spoke w<sup>th</sup><br></br> with an inly Tender feeling about the Choir<br></br> &amp; Choir Grace what she has felt since <br></br> she was Receiv'd in the Single Sisters Choir<br></br> &amp; what her dear Bridegroom has done from <br></br> time to time on her therein, &amp; Perticularly <br></br> in this Present Year, together with the Esteem</p>
      <p> &amp; Satisfaction she has had for, &amp; in the <a href=".html">Choir House</a><br></br> this she did from time to time Repeat And <br></br> also she would allways take notice of many <br></br> Sisters whom she saw &amp; Reflected on their <br></br> Situation at
         						Present and time Past &amp; when <br></br><a href="#mlper000702.html">Sister Mary</a> came to her then she would sell <br></br> her all her Mind about
         						them &amp; Especialy the <br></br>concern she had had, about her Class under <br></br> some heavy Circumstances some Months agoe <br></br> &amp; being ask'd
         						why she did not speak at such <br></br> time what she had in her mind? She answer'd <br></br> "that she always thought herself too mean <br></br> &amp; too insignificant to Speak Her

         						all become a Joy to Him </p>
      <p> Once in <a href="#mlper000702.html">Sister Mary</a>'s Presence after having <br></br> fully spoken &amp;
         						Open'd all her Mind to her a <br></br> bout Many things, she took Notice that her <br></br> Aunt (who faithfuly tended &amp; Nurs'd <br></br> her all the time of Sickness) was a Cry- <br></br> ing: So she demanded the Reason of her why <br></br> she wept, telling her she had no Ocassion <br></br> to weep for her since "says she" I am fully <br></br>Satisfied &amp; Reconciled both with My Lamb &amp; <br></br> &amp; with all my Sisters &amp; have spoke my
         						mind <br></br> about Everything &amp; Now am Ready to go <br></br> whenever he Pleases<br></br></p>
      <p> Thus she Continued under a Deep Sense <br></br> &amp; Speaking of herself &amp; her Choir &amp; Often <br></br> Expressing her Desire to go. But yet she
         							</p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> would Secretly sometimes say to her Aunt that <br></br> she believ'd she should live till <em>Christmas</em>, but <br></br> If our SaviourPleasd to take her before, she <br></br> would be glad</p>
      <p> Sunday Last about 11 or 12 in the Evening <br></br>she was Siez'd with the monst Violent pain<br></br> So that <a href="#mlper000702.html">Sister Mary</a> who at the same time <br></br> watch'd with her
         						Perceiv'd such a Senscible <br></br> Alteration not only by her Excessive Pains<br></br> but also by the Motion &amp; Alteration of all <br></br> her Faculties that she thought she Realy would <br></br> go, &amp; thereupon ask'd her if she was now quite <br></br>
         						Ready. She with Pleasure &amp; Serenity answer'd <br></br> "yes! I am Quite Ready now &amp; shall be glad to <br></br> go to my Lamb as soon as he Pleases" </p>
      <p> However she reviv'd a little &amp; then desired<br></br> 2 verses which she named to be sung for her <br></br> viz Appear as her Protector who turns to <br></br>Joy all Tears &amp; When she shall get Per- <br></br> mission to leave this Mortal Tent, From Pains<br></br> &amp; Griefs Dissmission Thy self Just then present <br></br> And then says she "Sing Hush stir not up <br></br> the friend of Christ, Wake not
