					<lb/>North of England
					<lb/>Memoir of our late B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> Jacob Borck who
					<lb/>departed at Bedford. Oct. 24. 1791
					<lb/>Our late Bro. having left no written account
					<lb/>of his Life, we can only say the following:
					<lb/>He was born at Arendal in Norway Oct. 13. 1727.
					<lb/>He lost his Father when very Young, the pray
					<lb/>ers &amp; admonitions of his Mother who was a
					<lb/>pious Woman &amp; sought to Educate him in the
					<lb/>nurture &amp; admonition of the Lord were a great
					<lb/>blessing to him, as a Child, &amp; when at 14 Years of
					<lb/>In age he went to Copenhagen &amp; there become Sur
					<lb/>geons Mate in the Danish Army, having been
					<lb/>brought up in that time of Life; In 1756 he enterd
					<lb/>Into the Service of the Russians army as Surgeon,
					<lb/>&amp; being in Russia, he was noticed by several
					<lb/>persons of the highest Rank, both on Account
					<lb/>of his engaging manners &amp; Skilfulness in is
					<lb/>profession, especially by the Viceroy of Ukraine
					<lb/>who greatly favord him, &amp; with whom he
					<lb/>travelled thro various parts of Russia, but thro
					<lb/>these conexions he was led into bad Company, &amp;
					<lb/>sinful habits, by which means he lost those
					<lb/>impressions of our Saviours grace, which he
					<lb/>had received in his Younger Years when he
					<lb/>had been solidly awakened, &amp; obtained a view
					<lb/>in Spirit of our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> sufferings, which remain
					<lb/>ed unforgetten by him. He however felt
					<lb/>great uneasiness of mind, amidst the gaieties
					<lb/>&amp; pleasures of the World, which he once disclosed

					<lb/>to a person of Rank in Russia acquainted with
					<lb/>the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> especially with Count Zinzendorff, who
					<lb/>spoke to him in and enrcourageng manner, &amp;
					<lb/>whose conversation was greatly blessed to him
					<lb/>the above mentioned person at the same time
					<lb/>related to him several particulars concerning
					<lb/>the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> of the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> which created a wish in him,
					<lb/>to become more nearly acquainted with them.
					<lb/>Accordingly in 1739 when he quitted Russia, he
					<lb/>resolved to pay a visit to the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> at Zeist, intend
					<lb/>ing to go from thence to England, to enter into his
					<lb/>Majestys Service on board a Westindia Ship. The first
					<lb/>meeting he attended at Zeist was a singing meeting
					<lb/>during which he was so overpowerd with a feeling of
					<lb/>divine Grace, that it was immediately made clear
					<lb/>to him that this was the people he belonged to, having
					<lb/>always from his infancy had a desire to live among
					<lb/>Children of God:, Here he also got acquainted with Count
					<lb/>Zinzendorff, who received him very cordially, Never
					<lb/> theless he for the present, pursued his intentions
					<lb/>of proceeding to England, where he engaged as Sur
					<lb/>geon onboord the Monarque in which Station he
					<lb/>remained about a Year, during the whole of which
					<lb/>time the Vessel lay in the harbours He kept up in
					<lb/>the mean time an acquaintance with the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> in
					<lb/>London: But the great Wickedness &amp; abandoned
					<lb/>life of the Ships crews, to which he was witness was
					<lb/>so disgusting to him, that he was glad to obtain
					<lb/>his dissmission. After this he lodged for a short time
					<lb/>with a B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> in London &amp; being desirous of coming
					<lb/>into still closer connection with the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> of the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi>

					<lb/>went in Oct<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> 1760 according to their advice to Bedford
					<lb/>where he moved into the Single B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rns</hi> House.
					<lb/>Tho he had it at first very hard in externals yet he
					<lb/>never Ussined,? but was always thankful to our
					<lb/>Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> for having brought him thither, &amp; used to express
					<lb/>himself to that effect, that he should esteem it the
					<lb/>greatest favor to live with Children of God, were he even
					<lb/>necessitated to live on Bread &amp; Water. He first engaged
					<lb/>with the late Doc. Vowel as a partner in business, but
					<lb/>after sometime this partnership was dissolved, &amp;
					<lb/>the set up for himself as Surgeon &amp; Apothecary.
					<lb/>He was received in the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> April 20 1761 &amp; admitted
					<lb/>to the holy Comunion Sept<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 26 in the same Year.
					<lb/>Nov<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 19<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1766 he was married to the S. Sister Hanah
					<lb/>Scorfield of the Choir House at Fulnec, his present
					<lb/>Widow by whom he has had one Daughter, now a
					<lb/>member of the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> at Bedford, He was very success
					<lb/>full in his profession, whereby he also proved a bless
					<lb/>ing to many of his patients in their dying mom
					<lb/>ents, was respected in the Town &amp; neighbourhood,
					<lb/>&amp; always a steady Friend to the poor even to his own
					<lb/>disadvantage. Tho his warm &amp; positive temper
					<lb/>&amp; disposition sometimes caused him trouble,
					<lb/>Yet his upright Sincere &amp; generous mind pro
					<lb/>cured him many Friends by whom he was much
					<lb/>esteemed, The reflection on his past unfaithful
					<lb/>ness to our Saviours Grace, &amp; the powerful sensa
					<lb/>tions he had of his great depravity, caused him
					<lb/>indeed many heavy hours, but amidst all this he
					<lb/>cleaved as a poor pardoned Sinner to his Redeemer

					<lb/>&amp; experienced rich comforts from him, which was
					<lb/>more especially perceptible in the last years of his
					<lb/>Life, when he grew more chearful &amp; happy &amp; resigned
					<lb/>His constitution which was naturally strong,
					<lb/>had been much impaired by fatiague of body &amp;
					<lb/>mind, about 5 Years ago he got a paralitic Stroke
					<lb/>which greatly enfeabled him, Since this time he
					<lb/>suffered greatly from increasing weakness, which
					<lb/>at last brought on a total delay of strength. His
					<lb/>present Widow our dear Sister Borck, has shew&apos;n
					<lb/>great &amp; unremitting tenderness in faithfully nur
					<lb/>sing him during this long period of illess. Amidst
					<lb/>his sufferings which was very great, his patience
					<lb/>was exemplary, &amp; he always expressed himself
					<lb/>thankful for the least services done him.
					<lb/>When visited his favorite topick was the Love &amp;
					<lb/>forbearance of our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> so consisintly displayed
					<lb/>in the mercy shewn to him, being plucked as
					<lb/>a brand out of the fire. Several weeks before
					<lb/>his departure it was evident, that he would not
					<lb/>continue long here below, from which time
					<lb/>forward, his mind seemed wholly disengaged
					<lb/>from all earthly cares, &amp; occupied in converse
					<lb/>with our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, he frequently prayed fervently
					<lb/>to him, entreating our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> to strengthen him &amp;
					<lb/>support him in his trouble, &amp; especially to be
					<lb/>near him in his last hours, He once told a
					<lb/>Brother who visited him that altho he had the

			<pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_88_Borck_Jacob-05.jpg" n='5'/>
			<p>
				
					<lb/>full assurance that he should go to our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>
					<lb/>as an absolved sinner, yet he could not deny
					<lb/>that he felt some dread at the thoughts of the
					<lb/>separation of Soul &amp; Body, but some days
					<lb/>after he intimated to the same Brother, that
					<lb/>he could now say with thanks to our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>
					<lb/>that this dread had been entirely removed.
					<lb/>A day or two before his departure, he expressed
					<lb/>in a very emphatical manner, his thankful
					<lb/>ness for having brought him to his ransom&apos;d
					<lb/>Congregation &amp; sealed his Salvation.
					<lb/>Oct<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r.</hi> 24<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1791 he was no longer able to speak,
					<lb/>&amp; from that time lay Still in sweet expectati
					<lb/>on of that blessed moment when his Redeemed
					<lb/>Soul should be translated into the mansions
					<lb/>of bliss. This favor was granted him about
					<lb/>nine oClock the same Evening when he
					<lb/>departed softly &amp; happily aged 64 years 11 days
					<lb/>Blessed are the dead, which die in the
					<lb/>Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit,
					<lb/>that they may rest from their Labour, &amp;
					<lb/>their works do follow them. Rev<hi rend='superscript:true;'>l</hi> 14. 13
