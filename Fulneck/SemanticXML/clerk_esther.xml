					some of the particulars of the tender lendings of <lb/>
					My gracious &amp; most faithfull <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>. The first <lb/>
					impression of grace I remember, was when I was <lb/>

					shall be append unto You, I felt somthing <lb/>
					particular at the time, I had a very quick under <lb/>
					standing for my years, and a very sensible feeling <lb/>
					of what was right, and wrong I wanted to be a good <lb/>
					Child that I might go to Heaven, on that account <lb/>
					I was much praised, which wou'd have been more <lb/>
					hurtfull to me, but the dear <roleName type="honorific">Holy Ghost</roleName> who had  <lb/>
					begun his work in my heart, pleased me continualy, my <lb/>
					wicked and sinfull nature, which kept me low &amp; <lb/>
					consions that I did not deserve that praise, which <lb/>
					was a grace to me at that time, so it checked my <lb/>
					Satanick pride, which I felt very sensible, Yet  <lb/>
					from many circumstances I thought God must <lb/>
					love me, but how it was I cou'd not tell, I have <lb/>
					I was a sinner, In my 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I was very thought <lb/>
					full and distress'd, felt guilt with the impression <lb/>
					that I did not love God, nor cou'd I promise him <lb/>
					which one day a little bird was made use of to  <lb/>
					shew me that I cou'd not praise my <roleName type="honorific">Creator</roleName> even <lb/>
					as a Bird cou'd I had also strange Idea's about <lb/>
					him, what kind of a form he had, and was much <lb/>
					perplexed about it at this time I had a dream where <lb/>
					in I thought God allmighty was in a parlour in  <lb/>
					the house where I was, and that he was a Man of <lb/>
					which I was very glad, &amp; thought then One cou'd be <lb/>
					familliar with him. But not understanding the  <lb/>
					gracious lending of my dear <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>, I continued
					<note type="catchword">extremly</note>
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					extremly distress'd, thought I commited Sin <lb/>
					evry moment by the strange thoughts I had, &amp; <lb/>
					they was of such a nature, I cou'd not tell them <lb/>
					to any body, nor wou'd they have understood me, <lb/>
					but wearied indeed with trying to help myself <lb/>
					a thought came in my mind, As I can not help <lb/>
					these thoughts God Almighty has nothing <lb/>
					against me. In that moment my mercifull <lb/>
					and compassinate Saviour drew near with his <lb/>
					love and gave me peace, it was as If he said to <lb/>
					me, I have nothing against thee, I was amazed <lb/>
					but did not know how to account for it, to be <lb/>
					loved by God in such a manner, from that time <lb/>
					When those thoughts came again I cou'd believe <lb/>
					he had nothing against me for it, but not under <lb/>
					standing the right poor Sinners path I came into <lb/>
					an esteem self rightious course, Striveing with <lb/>
					all my might to be good by other means then <lb/>
					Jesus blood, I fasted &amp; prayd, wanting to be as <lb/>
					good as the Primitive Christians, not likeing any <lb/>
					one to be better then myself, here my Satanick <lb/>
					pride show'd itself to a great degree, All how <lb/>
					unwilling was I to be saved by grace I went on <lb/>
					for some time in <add place="above">this</add> manner. My Aunt dieing who <lb/>
					brought me up, I became a Second time an Orphan <lb/>
					indeed She treated me as If She had known my <lb/>
					destination. Ah the wonders of My dear Saviours <lb/>

					His kind providence in My 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I went <lb/>
					to London into Lady Scarborough's Family. <lb/>
					who had sent for me to wait on her little Neice <lb/>
					and My dear Saviour put it into her heart from the first <lb/>
					moment to be remarkable kind to me, and the whole <lb/>
					family shew'd a great regard &amp; respect for my religious <lb/>
					turn of mind, which they found was sincere <lb/>
					(not on account of outward gifts or quatifications) <lb/>
					but the dear Holy Ghost in whose School I then <lb/>
					was, gave me a constant sence of My depraved <lb/>
					nature in all it shapes, and finding I fell so far <lb/>
					short of what I thought I shou'd be, this kept <lb/>
					me low and in some sence humble, and kept the <lb/>
					ballance against that hartfull prais which is <lb/>
					often given. I served also in several other families <lb/>
					namely Lord Orrory, Lady Charlott Edan's &amp; <lb/>
					the Duke of Buckclugh. My dear Saviour <lb/>
					and most faithfull Shepherd helped me through <lb/>
					with all my imperfections so wonderfully <lb/>
					that If I may humbly say so, I found favour <lb/>
					with God, &amp; Man, but I nor no body else, thought <lb/>
					what was prepareing for me. In my 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I <lb/>
					return'd to Lady Scarborough who always received <lb/>
					me with the greatest kindness, At this time I fell <lb/>
					again into self working fasted &amp; prayed much, till I  <lb/>
					was quite weared finding it did me no good, Once in <lb/>
					the Year 42 while at prayer I felt somthing very <lb/>
					blessed, it was quick like the fleeting of a Star
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					but it seemed to me all that was good, it was <lb/>
					Light Peace, Joy, all happiness in One moment <lb/>
					I thought it was the Holy Spirit, &amp; praied to <lb/>
					feel more of it. Soon after I received a letter <lb/>
					concerning the preaching of the Methodists which <lb/>
					I had never heard of. I was very much biggote to <lb/>
					the Church &amp; thought it a shame to go any where else <lb/>
					I thought how ever I wou'd inquire about them what <lb/>
					kind of people they wear, it happend at this time a <lb/>
					Methodist came in My way, and by his conversation <lb/>
					I was convinced of what I wanted, the knowledge of the <lb/>
					atonement of our Saviour for My Sins, then all his <lb/>
					gracious leading was brought to my mind so that I <lb/>
					knew it was a faith from God, the person lent me <lb/>
					a <del>Sermon</del> book of Sermons of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitfields <lb/>
					the more I read the more it was opened to me that <lb/>
					I wanted a Saviour, for my mind took a turn and <lb/>
					I found some rest from my <add place="above">hard</add>labour, and saw that it <lb/>
					was Christs rightousness that I wanted, I enterd <lb/>
					with my whole mind into the matter, got all the <lb/>
					books I cou'd of that kind amongst the rest I got <lb/>
					the Brethrens little Hymn book which sat'd me <lb/>
					exceedingly <del>well</del> espicialy One Verse, viz: If I <lb/>
					glimse in My own breast Feel of a Christian bliss <lb/>
					Then on the truth of it let me rest. That such a <lb/>
					Life there is. At length my good Lady found I had <lb/>
					got Methodist books, but did not think I was so deep <lb/>
					in the matter, for She had a better opinion of me <lb/>
					then that I wou'd follow such people, but one time

					being with her at Court, She caught me reading a <lb/>
					letter which she took from me, wherein She found I <lb/>
					had been Once at the Tabernacle, She was much <lb/>
					concern'd &amp; took the greatest pain possible to diss <lb/>
					waid me from it, but I was Devinly convinced of <lb/>
					the truth of the Gospel, my Lady forbid me to go <lb/>
					to the Tabernacle, I told her I <del>cou'd</del> wou'd not with <lb/>
					out leting her Ladyship know, I thought I cou'd do <lb/>
					with books &amp; Stay at Home, at this time the family <lb/>
					went into the Country, where was a good friend a <lb/>
					Minister who took great pain to prevent my <lb/>
					going too deep in my present Ideas, he brought me <lb/>
					many books but to no purpose, my heart was afraid <lb/>
					of the truth, We return'd to London and I grew very <lb/>
					uneasy, found I cou'd not be faithful without <lb/>
					going to hear the preaching, I therefore desired <lb/>
					leave, which was not granted. My good Lady was <lb/>
					now very much distress'd about me, She wanted <lb/>
					to keep me, &amp; out of Love &amp; kindness she did her <lb/>
					<del>when</del> what She cou'd to perswaid me, She wanted <lb/>
					me again to be advis'd by some Minsters, <lb/>
					I chose the Bishop of Oxford (Sacher) for that <lb/>
					purpose I was so clear in My matter I feared no-  <lb/>
					thing, my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> went with me to the Bishop and <lb/>
					accused me of leaving the Church, I told him <lb/>
					it was because they did not preach our Saviours <lb/>
					Sufferings, &amp; I was fully asured nothing else
						<note type="catchword">cou'd</note>
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					cou'd save me, this he aprov'd of, as to good work <lb/>
					I said, when the tree is good, the fruit will be good, <lb/>
					he was very tender with me finding I was Sincere <lb/>
					If it was possible I was more confirm'd in my point <lb/>
					then before, My dear Lady was much dissapointed <lb/>
					but I cou'd not help it, here She rested, she had <lb/>
					done all She cou'd but My matter remained to leave <lb/>
					her, or have leave to to go to the preachings, at last <lb/>
					I con'd do no longer, therefore went to hear the <lb/>
					preaching, I was wanted before I came home again, <lb/>
					My Lady ask'd me where I had been, I told her, She <lb/>
					said I had gone without leave, I said because her <lb/>
					Ladyship wou'd not have given the leave If I had <lb/>
					ask'd upon this She sent me out of the room <lb/>
					to see me no more, She was affraid to keep me on <lb/>
					account of the Children &amp; Servants, least I shou'd <lb/>

					words became litterally true, seek first the <lb/>
					Kingdom of God &amp; its Righteousness and all things <lb/>
					shall be added unto You, I was like a Child <lb/>
					turn'd out of doors (was again an Orphan) But <lb/>
					my ever faithfull Lord whose Hand &amp; Eye was over <lb/>
					me cared for me in evry respect. My Lady gave me <lb/>
					proof more of her kindness to me, finding I had <lb/>
					no acquaintance, sent me word that I shou'd lodge <lb/>
					there till I cou'd find a home the Servants was <lb/>
					amaized at me, because I was otherwise no person <lb/>
					of courage, but they did not know that I had found <lb/>
					the Pearl of great price. I stay'd with my Brother <lb/>
					in the day time till the preaching time at the <lb/>
					Tabernacle, my Brother was very shy to me, he was <lb/>
					sorry for My leaving such a good place. He look'd <lb/>
					into my books, made a good observation &amp; said all <lb/>
					professions make the Scriptures there rule, but <lb/>
					If this inward feeling can be true it must come from <lb/>
					God. It pleased he to hear him say so much. <lb/>
					I enquir'd of him for the Brethrens Chapel that I  <lb/>
					might see the people to whom by little Hymn Book <lb/>
					belong'd (this was in Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1744) He directed me <lb/>
					but when I came to Fetter Lane there was no preaching, <lb/>
					I enquir'd at the Chapel House S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wheeler kindly <lb/>
					ask'd me to come in Shewed me the Chapel, and what <lb/>
					She told the at that time of Our Saviour walking <lb/>
					amongst his People, made such an impression on
						<note type="catchword">me</note>
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					me that I never shall forget. It Tallied with my own <lb/>
					experience, I enquired if the Countes of Zinzendorf <lb/>
					did not want a Servant, but heard She was not in England. <lb/>
					I went to Speak with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitfield to advise with <lb/>
					him, and found him at B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Syms's, I told them my <lb/>
					case just as it was, S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Syms according to her kind way <lb/>
					in such cases took me into her house, thus I left my <lb/>
					good Lady &amp; all my old Friends, with greatfull <lb/>
					thanks for all their kindness &amp; I heartly pray that <lb/>
					My dear Lady May not loose her reward, I cou'd do no <lb/>
					other but follow my gracious Lord and Saviour, B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; <lb/>
					S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Syms Shewed me great kindness, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitfield &amp; <lb/>
					his Wife was also very kind to me, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitfield <lb/>
					going to George in about six weeks, this connexion <lb/>
					was ended. B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Syms being atach'd to the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> <lb/>
					I often went with them to Fetterlane, I had receive'd <lb/>
					many blessings by going to the Tabernacle, at this <lb/>
					time B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Syms moved, from which time I left off <lb/>
					going to the Taber. Now my good Lord led me Step <lb/>
					by Step as it pleased him both inwardly &amp; outwardly <lb/>
					in a most gracious manner which brings these lines <lb/>
					to my mind. With patience immense, And love so <lb/>
					intense, He hath led me on, I'm lost in amazment <lb/>
					When thinking thereon. Now being come to my proper <lb/>
					home, the dear Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> where I have enjoy'd more blessings <lb/>
					then I am able to express, they have been so many, and so <lb/>

					dearest thing to me, I am a Sinner to whom belongs <lb/>
					nothing but shame &amp; confusion of face, but it has <lb/>
					pleased him to open to me the treasure of his Love <lb/>
					&amp; great Salvation, which has been sealed to me by <lb/>
					his Spirit, by his Word, by his Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> as an eternal truth <lb/>
					for such was my make that I must know it as a truth <lb/>
					for myself, was truly convinced of unbeliefs, and my <lb/>
					enmity against our Saviour, when this came to the <lb/>
					highest pitch, I thought If there was another Saviour <lb/>
					I wou'd have him, I felt condemned for the thought <lb/>
					and in that moment I was overpowerd with the <lb/>
					love and peace of my dear Saviour, and as If he <lb/>
					said to me for all this I love thee. The feeling <lb/>
					and impression of his nearness, bow'd me down in <lb/>
					the dust before my gracious Lord, with this <lb/>
					Sensation, The poor Sinners happy feeling, the holy <lb/>
					shame. But My selfrighteousness still <lb/>
					troubled me in various shapes, but in that feeling <lb/>
					the following verse was sealed to me as the greatest <lb/>
					truth, O precious precious blood, The only Holiness <lb/>
					that's good, Still drop, &amp; flow &amp; cover me, it <lb/>
					cursed Sinner without thee. The Scripture, the <lb/>
					preachings, the Hymns, where open'd with such <lb/>
					truth &amp; Life which I can't describe.</p>
					<p>
					I left B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Syms with greatfull thanks for <lb/>
					all their care, and went to live with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Delamott <lb/>
					at Black Heath to take care of Betsey Holand <lb/>
					her Parents being gone to Germany, here I experienc'd
						<note type="catchword">something</note>
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					something particular in the first place to my shame. <lb/>
					I was shewn such love and respect from this dear <lb/>
					family, but what relates particularly to the heart <lb/>
					was as I have said the preachings had been so blessed <lb/>
					to me, being now all at once taken from all meetings, <lb/>
					which I felt much store by, it was amazing to me <lb/>
					that I now enjoy'd such a Sabatic stillness &amp; a <lb/>
					Sunshine of peace for that time, that I wanted <lb/>
					nothing, but was indeed as a Child at the breast. <lb/>
					I was not Yet in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> tho' I had defer'd it some <lb/>
					time. B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holand how comeing from Germany <lb/>
					I went with their Daughter to live with them. <lb/>
					I now thought much about being received into the <lb/>
					Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, but I had still to wait some time, which <lb/>
					was very wholsome for the I was once much comforted <lb/>
					by these words, Jesus thy affairs will think on, <lb/>
					as thy ever loveing Head. At length the hour which <lb/>
					certainly at the right moment, the Divine impression <lb/>
					to me was, I am now in by Fathers House, this was <lb/>
					May 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1747, and the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of Sep<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> following I had <lb/>
					the unspeakable grace to be a partaker of my dear <lb/>
					Saviours body &amp; blood in the Holy Sacrament.</p>
					<p>
					In this period ah! how good &amp; blessd was the Liturgies <lb/>
					&amp; all the Meeting to my poor heart beyond all expres <lb/>
					sion, I had the grace to feel that in myself I was <lb/>
					a poor Creature truely convinced no one worse, had a <lb/>
					solid feeling what Sin is in all its odious Shapes <lb/>
					I am sensible that I have given the dear Holy Ghost
						<note type="catchword">much trouble to</note>

					to keep me low as a sinner, my dear B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> <lb/>
					will understand what that sensation is a solid <lb/>
					feeling what is sin, but <unclear>not to touch sin God forbid</unclear> <lb/>
					In this Year I went to live at Mile end with the <lb/>
					Children here I had new appearings of my dear Saviours <lb/>
					Love and grace especially relating to my Choir. I <lb/>
					was drawn to read the Canticles &amp; these Disciples <lb/>
					of our Saviours love to his Church was opend to <lb/>
					me with such truth &amp; reallity as I can't express <lb/>
					The following verse was much impressed on my mind <lb/>
					at this time, O thou the fairest of mankind</p>
					<p>
					Thy beauty strike both heart &amp; mind. But <lb/>
					nothing is so fair in thee. As thy sweet form <lb/>
					upon the tree and can thro' his love &amp; grace say <lb/>
					Nothing has so struck me. As when God's <lb/>
					Spirit took me too Golgotha O God be prais'd <lb/>
					This has a period in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of some extravegances <lb/>
					But can say for myself I am truly convinc'd <lb/>
					by my own experiance that there was a glory <lb/>
					from the Lord, indeed too great for earthly minds <lb/>
					long to bear, but I expect to see it again in <lb/>
					perfection without a Vail between, and with <lb/>
					the whole Sinners train surround that Cavity <lb/>
					where I shall dwell eternally, at this time <lb/>
					that verse was realised to my heart, To be <lb/>
					enamour'd I know well, To have the heart quite <lb/>
					overflowing, For him alone to be so glowing <lb/>
					Expressions only me here fail. About this
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					this time I also had a new school for my own heart <lb/>
					concerning the Virgin Station, and found that only <lb/>
					by partaking of the Nature of the only Virgin man <lb/>
					one cou'd deserve that Character, this was made <lb/>
					very clear to me, Fair gifts of my creation, quite <lb/>
					spirit'd made me disspair for this grace, the <lb/>
					knowledge of myself (in this particular) I adore &amp; <lb/>
					thank my dear Lord &amp; his Spirit for teaching me <lb/>
					the way to turn to his precious blood, which alone <lb/>
					can cleanse our hearts and make all good, I found <lb/>
					it an antidote against all those sins that stick <lb/>
					so close to our nature.</p>
					<p>
					In the year 1751 I was sent to care for the Single <lb/>
					S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in Ockbrook and in Sep<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1757 I receiv'd a call <lb/>
					to go to Tytherton for the same purpose, and arrived <lb/>
					there in the Angels <gap reason="illegible"/>, this Jurney I shall <lb/>
					never forget, it was very much bless'd to me through <lb/>
					the nearness of my gracious Lord, and the impression <lb/>
					I had of the aid of his dearAngels, July 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1763 <lb/>
					I return'd again to Ockbrook, and Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1772 <lb/>
					I arrived in London where I hope to finish my poor <lb/>
					&amp; insignificant labour, In all these places my <lb/>
					best Friend has help'd me through in wholesome <lb/>
					poverty both internally &amp; externally, and I can <lb/>
					say with the Deciples, I have lacked nothing, have <lb/>
					been rich in the midst of poverty, here I desire <lb/>
					to give my due thanks to My dear Bretheren &amp;

					and S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, and particularly those of My own Choir <lb/>
					for their love kindness &amp; patience towards me. <lb/>
					But ah! how much is due to by dearest &amp; best <lb/>
					Friend &amp; lover, for his Election of grace &amp; for the <lb/>
					knowledge of his dear Wounded Person, his precious <lb/>
					blood, and all what he is to me, I conclude with <lb/>
					the 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> verse of the 43<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Chapter of Eccleasiastious <lb/>
					which well express my mind, When You Glorify the <lb/>
					Lord, exalt him as much as God can; for even Yet <lb/>
					will he far exceed; and when You exalt him, put forth <lb/>
					all Your Strength, and be not weary, for You can <lb/>
					never go for enough. Thus far our late Sisters account. <lb/>
					Having serv'd the Single Sisters Choirs with great <lb/>
					faithfulness, and blessing in several Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi> (had the <lb/>
					confidence of her Sisters who always found in her a kind <lb/>
					and Sympathizing friend ready to share with them in <lb/>
					joy &amp; smart, the prosperity of every One laying very <lb/>
					near her heart) till her bodily infirmities wou'd no <lb/>
					longer permit her to do what her heart &amp; mind was <lb/>
					Still willing for June 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1782 She arrived here <lb/>
					in Fulneck to injoy a Sabath. During the 8 years <lb/>
					of her abode here, She often express'd her gratitude <lb/>
					to our Saviour for his kind leadings of her through <lb/>
					this Vale of tears and that she had the favour to <lb/>
					enjoy her time of rest in this dear Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. She had the <lb/>
					love and respect of ev'ry one that knew her we can with <lb/>
					truth give her this testimony that She approved
						<note type="catchword">herself</note>
			</p>
			<p>
					herself among us as a real Child of peace.</p>
					<p>
					At our last Choir Festival She was present at all <lb/>
					the meetings, which was the last time she was able <lb/>
					to go out after which She lost her strength very <lb/>
					perceptably but her longing to be at home with her <lb/>
					dearst Lord encreased daily, two days before her <lb/>
					happy departure She said a S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> that was with <lb/>
					her with great emotion of heart, I go to our Saviour <lb/>
					as the greatest Sinner, not one so great as I am, <lb/>
					but this I can tell You, He has pardon'd all my <lb/>
					transgressions &amp; clothed me in the robe of his <lb/>
					righteousness, on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May at 11 oClock <lb/>
					in the forenoon She desir'd to be helped up I see she said <lb/>
					our Saviour he to here, now he will soon fetch me, <lb/>
					after which she lay mostly Still, till 7 oClock <lb/>
					in the Evening when the long wish'd for moment <lb/>
					came, that She departed softly &amp; happily into the  <lb/>
					joy of her Lord with the blessing of her Choir <lb/>
					in the 76<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year of her Age.
