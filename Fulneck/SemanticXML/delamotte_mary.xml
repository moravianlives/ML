					Our late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary Delamotte was born <lb />
					Oct 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1729 in London and baptized <lb />
					in the Church of England. Her Father <lb />
					being a Justice of peace and a pious man <lb />
					gave her a good education &amp; brought her <lb />
					up in the love &amp; fear of God. But <lb />
					as she he failed in his external cir- <lb />
					cimstances it was a great grief to him <lb />
					to see her unprovided for he recomended <lb />
					her to the care &amp; protection of the <lb />
					Lord. After his departure both she <lb />
					&amp; her Mother joined the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> <lb />
					&amp; Oct 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1749 she was by receiption <lb />
					into the same added into closer con- <lb />
					nection. May 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1750 she moved <lb />
					to Bedfort where she May 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1757 <lb />
					the first time partook of the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> <lb />
					in Oct the same year she came to live <lb />
					here at Fulnek; tho&apos; something had <lb />
					occurred which at that time desturbed <lb />
					her mind, yet she settled very well, and <lb />
					not being used to poverty &amp; spinning, it <lb />
					was edifying to those who knew her at <lb />
					that time, to see her conduit and resig- <lb />
					nation. When some years after a day <lb />
					School was begun here for the Children

					in the Place she was appointed for that <lb />
					purpose, where she served with faith <lb />
					fulness for several years; &amp; the Children <lb />
					committed to her care loved &amp; respected <lb />
					her much. July 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1768 she was ac- <lb />
					cepted an Acoloth. <del>Her</del> She spent her time  <lb />
					amongs us in a general way happy;</p>
					<p>
					she placed <del>her</del> her confidence in our <lb />
					Saviour with Childlike reliance, and  <lb />
					when she spoke of his Goodness &amp; mercy <lb />
					towards her, her Eyes overflowed with <lb />
					tears, to attend the meeting was her <lb />
					hearts delight and nothing would grieve <lb />
					her more; then when she was <del>not able</del> <add place="above">deprived</add> <lb />
					<del>to attent</del> <add place="above">of that blessing</add> To do good and assist others <lb />
					in whatever she could was her greatest <lb />
					pleasure. Of late years, age and infermi <lb />
					tie increasing, she was an Inhabitant <lb />
					of the Sickroom tho she was able to go <lb />
					about. Apr 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1810 the unfortuned circum-  <lb />
					stance happened, when she was left <lb />
					alone for about 5 minutes, her Cloths <lb />
					took fire, &amp; she was much hurt. <lb />
					However every thing being done to help <lb />
					her, we were in hopes she would get over <lb />
					it, but it proved in vain. Her

					<l>patience under her heavy suffering &amp; afflic</l>
					<l>tion &amp; her heartmoving prayers which</l>
					<l>she often put up to our Saviour,</l>
					<l>was an edification to all who vi-</l>
					<l>sited her; she was very grateful to those</l>
					<l>whose waited on her &amp; watched with</l>
					<l>her; &amp; wished no body to miss as she</l>
					<l>loved all dearly &amp; liked to see them.</l>
					<l>June 16th her sufferings increasing much</l>
					<l>she prayed fervendly to our Saviour, soon</l>
					<l>to take her to himself; &amp; being very</l>
					<l>desirous to receive the blessing for</l>
					<l>her departure, while she was sensible</l>
					<l>to it, this request was granted her,</l>
					<l>during on this occation our Saviour pre-</l>
					<l>sense was sensibly felt, &amp; she prayed</l>
					<l>with uplifted hands: &quot;Dear Saviour!</l>
					<l>come soon; thy mercy is my only plea</l>
					<l>Thy stripes, thy sounds &amp; a agony, have</l>
					<l>healed me poor worthless sinner, O </l>
					<l>take my soul to rest, come soon,</l>
					<l>come soon!&quot; After this she lay mostly</l>
					<l>still, and the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> it pleased our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></l>
					<l>to release her from all her pain &amp; to trans-</l>
					<l>late her into the mentions of bliss.</l>
