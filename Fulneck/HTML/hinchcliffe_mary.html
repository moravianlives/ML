      <p> The Course of Life of the <br/> Married Sister<a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000574.html">Mary Hinchcliff</a><br/> who went happily to our Sav<sup>r</sup>:: on the <em>29<sup>th</sup> Aug<sup>st</sup> 1770</em><br/> She was born at <a href="#mlpla000349.html">Wibsey in the Parish of
            <br/>
            Bradford Yorkshire</a> in <em>August 1718</em>, <br/><del>and</del> was brought up in the Presbyterian<br/> Religion and in her

         <br/>
         into Society in
         						<em>1745</em>: but afterwards <br/> absented herself for a while till after she <br/>
         						had marriedB<sup>r</sup><a href=".html">John Hinchcliff</a> in <em>1749</em>, <br/><del>after a while</del><sup>when</sup> she came again with her <br/> Husband to the
         						Meetings of the Brethren<br/> and since has gone on as a loving Sinner-

         (at <a href="mlpla000003.html">Fullneck</a>) in <em>1758</em> and partook the <br/> 1<sup>st</sup> Time of the Holy Sacrament with the <br/>Congreg<sup>n</sup> in <em>September 1763</em>. Our Sav<sup>r</sup><br/>blessd her Marriage with one Son who is <br/> yet with his Father and
         						a Member of our <br/>Society, and one Daugh<sup>r</sup>
         						who is already <br/> gone home to the Lord. B<sup>r</sup> &amp; Sis<sup>r</sup><br/><a href=".html">Greening</a> say: that since they have known Sis<sup>r</sup></p>
   	
   	
   	
      <p><a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000574.html">Hinchcliff</a> they observd in her something <br/> of the character which the Holy Scriptures
         						<br/> give us of the Mother of our Lord: that is <br/> she was poor in her own Eyes, quiet and
         <br/>
         yet hearty. When at the late settling of the <br/>Helpers Conference in this Congreg<sup>n</sup> our <br/>Sav<sup>r</sup> directed that she should be a Member
         						<br/> thereof, it had a very blessed Effect on her
         <br/>
         Heart, she expressd
         						herself about it with Love<br/>Shames &amp; counted herself very poor &amp; unfit. <br/> The Sunday before her Departure having <br/> been at the
         						Meetings with her Husband she <br/> afterwards <sup>was
            							overheard</sup> comforting a dejectedSis<sup>r</sup>very

         						<br/> sat down and convers'd awhile very heartily<br/>
         about her own <sup>inward</sup> poverty, expressing at the same <br/>
         						time (tho indirectly) her Love towards our <br/>dearSav<sup>r</sup>, <sup>&amp; more directly</sup>
         						her Love to her Husband, her
         <br/>care &amp; concern that her Sons Soul
         						might <br/> prosper, and that he might be preserved for <br/> the Lord. She
         						then appeard pretty well in <br/> Health as she was also the next Day till
         						<br/> afternoon, when she complain'd of her Head<br/> &amp; soon after
         						sitting down was gone to her <br/>Lord in a minute or two in a quiet and </p>
      <p> easy Manner (with scarce any Struggle <br/> of the Body) in the 52<sup>d</sup> Year of her Age. <br/> Her Corpse had afterwards a lovely aspect
         						<br/> as the Countenance of a reconciled com-
         <br/>
         forted Sinner which had
         						placidly slept <br/> in the Lord. She was also a most loving<br/>
         Daughter in Law to B<sup>r</sup><a href=".html">Hinchcliffs</a> Father <br/> &amp;
         						Mother who are both very ancient &amp; could <br/> not enough express how

         						<br/> a real Loss in her Departure, as well as <br/> other necessitous
         						People, whom she made
         <br/>
         it her Pleasure to help. For the Lord had <br/>
         						given her a lovingcompassionate Heart. </p>
