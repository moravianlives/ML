                    <p>
            <lb/>Departed May 5 1761
            <lb/>Hannah Ashly was born at Hartshead. Aug 20 1740
            <lb/>Yorkshire
            <lb/>Thro' the Conduct of my Parents, &amp; the
            <lb/>Education I rec'd from them, I became in my
            <lb/>Infancy desireous of an acquaintance with our
            <lb/>Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>, whereupon I entered into the care of the
            <lb/>Bre<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>, &amp; about my 6<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> year, I frequented went to the
            <lb/>School in Morefield, where one Day Bro<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Heltd
            <lb/>being in a close Conversation with the Children
            <lb/>made mentioned of the wound in our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>  Side-Hole which par
            <lb/>ticularly drew my attention, it seem'd to me as
            <lb/>if I has never heard of that Place before, I
            <lb/>cou'd not rest till I had made Enquiry about it
            <lb/>of one of my Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>, who inform'd me that it
            <lb/>was the Place which the Soldier pierc'd when
            <lb/>Our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> shed His Blood for the Remission of Sins
            <lb/>&amp; expired on the Cross for the Salvation of all
            <lb/>poor Sinners; this fill'd me with a real concern
            <lb/>&amp; encreas'd my desire after the Knowledge of our
            <lb/>Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; I long'd very much to know that dear
            <lb/>Place in His Side, &amp; to be therein a happy &amp;
            <lb/>good Child: in order to attain thereto I occu
            <lb/>pied myself in learning Verses, &amp; thought by
            <lb/>constant singing of our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; His side, to
            <lb/>procure for myself that acquaintance with
            <lb/>Him, which my heart wanted. when speaking
            <lb/>with my Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> who kept the School, she told me
            <lb/>that the Method I had began wou'd not bring
            <lb/>me make me acquainted with our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>, this touch'd me
            <lb/>very deeply &amp; brought many Tears from my Eyes</p>
                </div>
                <div type="page" n="2">
                    <pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_55_Ashly_Hannah-02.jpg" n="2"/>
                    <p>
            <lb/>she also added, that if we children desired
            <lb/>to become our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> &amp; wou'd pray Him
            <lb/>to bless us, He wou'd draw near to our Hearts
            <lb/>&amp; make us happy thro' the Merits of those
            <lb/>wounds which we were so desireous of being
            <lb/>acquainted with. to all this I listen'd very at
            <lb/>tentively, &amp; went on 4 or 5 years, longing Child
            <lb/>likely in my Heart to become our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>. in my
            <lb/>10<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> year I was put into a Class with other
            <lb/>Children which was very weighty to me, here I
            <lb/>perceiv'd that I had not yet attain'd to any
            <lb/>feeling Knowledge in my Heart, which I from this
            <lb/>Time continued longing after. In my 13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> Year
            <lb/>I was rec'd by our dear Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Anna Johanna
            <lb/>into the great-Girls Choir, which proved a real
            <lb/>Blessing to me caus'd in me such a new stiring of
            <lb/>Grace in me, that I felt nothing cou'd
            <lb/>satisfie me until my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> wou'd please
            <lb/>to manifest himself to my worthless Heart, that
            <lb/>I thereby might be cured of all my Sinfulness
            <lb/>thro' His precious Blood; This Longing continued
            <lb/>till my 15<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> year, in which I felt a change &amp;
            <lb/>unsteadiness in my self, which caus'd me many
            <lb/>heavy hours, I privately bemoan'd this my Con
            <lb/>dition with many Tears: I felt my self overpowerd
            <lb/>with the Depravity of my Nature, hence I with
            <lb/>drew as much as possible from all kind of
            <lb/>Fellowship, not knowing in these Critical moments</p>
                </div>
                <div type="page" n="3">
                    <pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_55_Ashly_Hannah-03.jpg" n="3"/>
                    <p>
            <lb/>which way to take, &amp; wou'd rather have given
            <lb/>up all than feel the Perplexities which I now
            <lb/>Labour'd under in this Extreamity of heart
            <lb/>mind I withdrew into a Field, when I prostrat
            <lb/>ed before my Lord &amp; maker beging Him to direct
            <lb/>&amp; shew me what course to take; after a few mom
            <lb/>ments Pause, I felt an Intimation in my Heart
            <lb/>to return to my former Purpose of becoming
            <lb/>entirely our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>. here my great Perplexity
            <lb/>left me &amp; I felt some Comfort; I plainly per
            <lb/>ceived the dangerous Path I had been pursuing
            <lb/>by my unfaithful Course, which caused me many
            <lb/>Tears. I chearfully returned to my class &amp; converse
            <lb/>with my dear Labourer about the situation of my
            <lb/>Heart, &amp; beg'd Forgiveness. all the opportunities
            <lb/>were now more lively &amp; engaging to me than
            <lb/>before. I felt a real fellowship with my Choir &amp;
            <lb/>a Degree of Comfort in my Heart.
            <lb/>In my 16<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> Year I had the Grace to be rec'd into
            <lb/>the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>, it was quite unexpected I being from
            <lb/>a sense of my great unworthiness discouraged
            <lb/>&amp; almost out of Hope &amp; cou'd not expect
            <lb/>to enjoy such a Grace, this together with my
            <lb/>reception into the little Virgins Choir (which hap
            <lb/>pen'd about the same time) fill'd my Heart &amp; Eyes
            <lb/>with blushing es &amp; Tears &amp; bow'd me in the very dust
            <lb/>for shame; feeling I was at this Interval under
            <lb/>to Special Labour of the dear Mother by whose</p>
                </div>
                <div type="page" n="4">

                    <p>
            <lb/>gracious Intimations I saw &amp; felt the Depravi
            <lb/>ty of my wretched nature &amp; that I was not yet
            <lb/>according to my Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> mind, yet I felt refresh
            <lb/>ing comforts from His precious Nearness.
            <lb/>I now felt a great Desire to live in the Choir
            <lb/>House but my circumstances, not permiting it, I was
            <lb/>much grieved &amp; shed many Tears on that account.
            <lb/>but I enjoy'd the opportunities Meetings with real Grace &amp;
            <lb/>Blessing. In my 18<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> year I obtained leave to move
            <lb/>into the Gummersel Oeconomy, this was a blessed
            <lb/>School for my poor Heart, here in Conversation &amp;
            <lb/>Fellowship with the Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> my Heart came into a
            <lb/>closer Connexion with my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; a better
            <lb/>Understanding of the blessed Lessons from the dear
            <lb/>Holy-Ghost. at this time I also felt a great long
            <lb/>ing in my Heart after the
            <lb/>Enjoyment of my dear Lords Corpse &amp; Blood; the
            <lb/>Nov<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> following, I became a Partaker of that in
            <lb/>expressable Grace which melted me into shame
            <lb/>&amp; deep Abatement. about 6 months after I re
            <lb/>moved into the Choir-House where I was plac'd
            <lb/>among the great-Girls, this was a quite par
            <lb/>ticular Period of my Life wherein the faithful
            <lb/>Labour of the dear Mother brought me to feel
            <lb/>how short I still was in the true Knowledge of
            <lb/>the Sinner Point. At that remarkable &amp; by me
            <lb/>never to be forgotten Choir Communion March 1759
            <lb/>I also saw my deficiency in Sacrament &amp; Choir
            <lb/>Ideas, which made a deep Impression upon my</p>

                    <div type="page" n="5">

                    <p>
            <lb/>my Heart. at the Participation of the holy corpse I got
            <lb/>an Insight into my connexion with my dearest
            <lb/>Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> so as I never felt it before.
            <lb/>On the Single Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Festival May 1759 I was
            <lb/>rec'd into the Single Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Choir: this aweful Trans
            <lb/>action made a deep Impression upon me; my Heart
            <lb/>thus seiz'd &amp; overpowerd enter'd into a Covenant with
            <lb/>my Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to live &amp; abide by Him eternally from
            <lb/>this very Day. The Opportunities on this special Day of
            <lb/>Grace &amp; Blessing, together with my Transition from my
            <lb/>late Choir &amp; Class Companions, had such an effect
            <lb/>upon me, that now a new Schooling commenc'd.
            <lb/>I attaind to a farther Knowledge of my Heart &amp;
            <lb/>natural Depravity; but thro' the Grace &amp; Fellowship
            <lb/>which I enjoyd among the Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>, &amp; also the blessed
            <lb/>Labour in my Choir, I learnt how to treat, &amp; bring
            <lb/>each Circumstance before the Heart of my dearest
            <lb/>Bridegroom, who by his bloody Grace overstream'd and
            <lb/>helped me on from Day to Day, so that I became
            <lb/>quite chearful &amp; happy in my Heart &amp; thankful for
            <lb/>that blessed Election which united &amp; incircled me in
            <lb/>His Virgin-Choir.
            <lb/>After some months enjoyment of a blessed Intercourse
            <lb/>of Grace &amp; Special Leading of my best Friend, I was
            <lb/>attack'd by symptoms of a Disorder which very much
            <lb/>affected my mind, &amp; in some measure retarded my happy
            <lb/>&amp; chearful course; thus I spent some months in serious
            <lb/>Thoughts a Reflections, believeing at the same Time that
            <lb/>my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> suffer'd my body to be afflicted in
            <lb/>order to keep me the more circumspectly by my Heart.
            <lb/>thus for her own Words</p>

            <lb/>Towards the later End of Dec<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 1760. she moved
            <lb/>into the Sick-Room: here one cou'd plainly per
            <lb/>ceive that she had Hopes her Time wou'd not
            <lb/>be long, which caus'd a particular Chearfulness in her
            <lb/>Look. her ardent longing was to be speedily releas'd
            <lb/>from her bodily Pain, haveing endur'd a great Deal,
            <lb/>her Disorder being of an oppressive kind, &amp; of a long
            <lb/>Duration, she became again somewhat thoughtful con
            <lb/>cerning her Heart: she often said "O what can there
            <lb/>be between me &amp; my Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> which delays my going
            <lb/>to Him. in this her concern of mind we comforted
            <lb/>her, &amp; bid her have Patience. April 5<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1761 her Class
            <lb/>Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> had a Love-Feast in the Sick-Room, which was
            <lb/>an particular Joy to her. she frequently ask'd if any
            <lb/>one cou'd informe her of the Time when her wish'd
            <lb/>for Hour would strike, to know this was all she wanted
            <lb/>for nothing cou'd satisfie her heart, but the Thoughts
            <lb/>of giveing her Bridegroom soon the meeting.
            <lb/>Thus she spent her Days in a Sabbatick stillness
            <lb/>speaking very little.
            <lb/>On the 4<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> of may she desir'd to see Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Mary whom
            <lb/>she saluted with a particular Chearfulness &amp; Serenity,
            <lb/>which was observ'd by all the Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> in the Room. we
            <lb/>were all of Opinion that she might probably go
            <lb/>that Day, when this was mentiond to her, she seem'd
            <lb/>extremly glad thereof, but when she recolected that
            <lb/>all the Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> wou'd be engag'd (it being our Festival) &amp;
            <lb/>might to some be inconvinient, she knew not what to
            <lb/>choose; yet said she, I am truely resignd to the
            <lb/>will of my best Freind, may He do with me His poor
            <lb/>Child according to His Heart, for now I am quite satis</p>

                    <p>
            <lb/>fied. Thus the spent this day of Grace with a
            <lb/>chearful Heart, tho' in great Pain of Body.
            <lb/>Towards Night she alter'd very much a became speechless,
            <lb/>by which it was desernable that her Dissolution drew near.
            <lb/>in this situation she continued till about 3 in the
            <lb/>morning, when her Laboures kept her an anointed
            <lb/>Liturgy, &amp; imparted unto her the Blessing of her Choir.
            <lb/>Thus the Home-sick Dove took flight into the Wounds
            <lb/>of her beloved Bridegroom, about 4 O'Clock in the
            <lb/>Morning in the 21<hi rend="superscript:true;">st</hi> year of her age.
            <lb/>She has left in her Choir the Charracter
            <lb/>of an honest, upright, &amp; enamourd Virgin Heart.
            <lb/>She was the whole Time of her sickness very
            <lb/>agreeable to all about her, &amp; behaved with becom
            <lb/>ing Patience. she with Childlikeness continued to
            <lb/>deport her self, with a Heart truely thankful
            <lb/>for all the Care &amp; nursing which was bestowed upon
            <lb/>her in the Sick-Room.
            <lb/>Her Behaviour evidenc'd a particular Nearness of
            <lb/>the Person of her dearest Bridegroom. At the En
            <lb/>joyment of her dear Lords Corpse &amp; Blood, (of which
            <lb/>she was on her Sick-Bed 5 times a Partaker) her
            <lb/>heart was sinnerlikely thankful; this renderd her
            <lb/>Home-sickness bearable, until the was favour'd
            <lb/>with the Kiss of His pale Lips.
