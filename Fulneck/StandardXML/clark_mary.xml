            <lb/>her 8<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> year she was seiz'd with Hysteric Fits, which continu'd her whole
            <lb/>Life, her Mother asked her of she was not concern'd that the Doctor
            <lb/>could not help her, she reply'd No, she wanted to go Our Saviour. &amp;
            <lb/>when she heard of any of the S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> in the Choir House being going Home she
            <lb/>expresst her concern in these words, now their is another gone &amp; I am
            <lb/>left nevertheless if Our Saviour pleases to keep me still longer am
            <lb/>content. sometimes her Mother was oblig'd to miss the Meetings
            <lb/>on her account tho' with reluctance to both, but she always comforted
            <lb/>her saying dont be uneasy, Our Saviour is with us. - one Day her
            <lb/>Mother perceiving her look very thoughtful asked the reason she reply'd
            <lb/>I have been at the Meeting &amp; B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Talor spoke of the Bread from Heaven
            <lb/>He told the Children if any of them asked their Parents for Bread they
            <lb/>would give it them, but their was another Sort needful, &amp; that Our
            <lb/>Saviour would bestow upon every one who asked Him for it. she adding.
            <lb/>when I go to Our Saviour then I shall get that Bread &amp; never want any
            <lb/>more of yours. another time when she had been reprov'd by her Mistress School S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
            <lb/>she ran to her Mother requesting her to get her pardon'd saying I can't
            <lb/>sleep if any Body has any thing against me.  her Mistress School S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; all the
            <lb/>Scholars lov'd her dearly, as she was of a mild temper &amp; very diligent, she
            </p>
            <pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_32_ClarkMary-02.jpg" n="2"/>
            <p>
            <lb/>she could not bear to see the Children Idle or lightminded &amp; often reprovd
            <lb/>them for it, 6 weeks before her departure, she was more sorrowful then
            <lb/>ever she had been, &amp; told her Mother the Children in the School had been
            <lb/>reading about the Day of Judgment &amp; I dare not meet Our Saviour, but her
            <lb/>Sorrow was soon turned into Joy, &amp; she said now I know I shall be happy
            <lb/>when ever it pleases Our Saviour to take me &amp; it He thinks best for me to
            <lb/>stay a little longer, am quite resign'd tho' I had rather go to Him a week
            <lb/>before her Departure she fell a sleep in the Meeting &amp; alterd for going
            <lb/>Home. the Day before she went Home she said to her Mother &amp; S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> I love
            <lb/>you both dearly &amp; could like you to go with me to Our Saviour. her
            <lb/>Mother reply'd when He pleases we will go the next Day she expresst her
            <lb/>ardent longing to be at Home, to her Father, &amp; said but I shall soon be
            <lb/>with our Saviour. - just before she drew her last Breath she called
            <lb/>her S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; bid her look at something pritty, but could not describe it.
            <lb/>she did this 3 times together, then her happy Soul took Flight into
            <lb/>the Arms of her Redeemer, in the 12<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> year of her Age her Corspe had
            <lb/>a very agreable aspect
