Hannah Ashly born
had the conduct & Education given me by my parents
I became in My infancy desirous to become acquainted
with our Saviour & took in to the Care of the Brn
about my 6 year frequenting the Schools kept by Care
of the Brn, Br Hilt being one day in Close conversation
wth the Children made mention of our Savrs side hole
which drew a particular attention in me as if I had
never heard of that place before therefor cou'd not
rest till I had made inquirey about it of one of my
Sistrs who inform'd me it was the place which the
Soldior when our Saviour Sh'd his blood for the
remission of Sins, at wch time he Expired on the Cross that
all poor Sinners Might be save'd from their Sins this
made a real concern upon my Mind & a Secret desire to
become acquainted with our Savr that I might thereby know
this place in his Side & be also happy & a good Child, but
I knew not how to accomplish my intentions but resolved to
Learn a deal of verses & thereby Sing of our Savr & the side
hole with a Constancy till I came to the knowledg of it,
making My Mind known to the Sistr who kept the school
who told us children me & several others that this wou'd not bring
us acquainted with our Savr, this affect me with much
concern & cause many tears to flow, she also aded that if
we desired to become our dr Savrs we must be very good Childrn
out of Love & obedience to him & then he & pray to him to bless
us poor Childrn & then he woud be near to our hearts & make us
happy thro' the Merit of those wounds which we are desirous
to be come acquainted with. I listend atteintively to all
this & went on for 4 or five years with a Childlike Longing
in My heart to become our Saviours & about My 10 year was look


into a Class amongst the rest of the Children which 
was of real Consequence to me, for by the converse
therein I plainly perceive I had not yet attaind to ??
fuling knowledge in My heart for which I was Continous
Longing after, in My 13 year I was took into the G G
Choir by Our dr Sistr Anna Johanna this was a real
blessing & caused a particular Stirring in My Mind not
rest till My dearest Saviour Manifestd himself to
my worthless heart, that I thereby might be Curd of all my
sinfullness thro' his precious blood, this Earnest Long
ing continued till My 15 year in which I felt
particular change & unsteadyness thro' in Myself
which Caused me many unEasy hours & day which I
with Many Tears ???? bemoaned being over
power'd with the depravity of my Nature I abstain'd
as much as possable from all fellowship of any kind
for in those Critical Moments I knew not which way to 
nor what to say but would gladly a given up all rather than feel 
the perplexities I Laboured under in this Extremity of
heart & Mind I took into the feilds & prosterated before
My Lord & maker desire him to direct me which Course
hed have me take & in a few moments pause I felt my
Heart again with certain intimations impress'd therein
for me to return to my former Good intention & become
intirely our dr Saviours, from this there my great perplexities
left me & I felt some comfort in my mind, & plainly perceived
the dangerous paths I had been persueing which Cause me
Many Tears this unfaithfull Course which caused me many Tears
but I cherefully return'd unto My Class & converse with My
dr Labourer about My heart situation & sought forgiveness


for whats past, all the oppertunities I injoyd was now Much more
lively to me & ingaging, I now began to feel a real fellow
ship in My Choir & some Grace to comfort me towards the
Sisters End of my 16y I had the Grace to be received into the congn
way unExpectedly for I at this time felt my Sinfullness which
baffled all my hopes & Expectations of injoying Such a Grace
Jan 12 was received into the little virgins Choir, this filld My
heart & Eyes with blusshing Tears & bowed me in the very dust for
I came under the present feeling of my wretched nature, which
the dr mother holy Ghost Laborer in my heart plainly let me see
that I was not according to the Savrs mind, yet I felt refreshing com
forts from his precious nearness, & begun to feel desires of living
in the Sisrs house, but my Circumstances not permiting this
according to my Mind this Caused me many Tears, but I injoyd
the oppertunities with real Grace & blessing, & in My 18 year
I had leave to live in the oceonomie at Gomersul, this was
a blessed School for My poor hear were in the fellowshiply
conversation with the Sistrs I Learnt to understand My hears connect
ion with my dearest Saviour & how in some small measure
to discern the Lessons from the dr holy Ghost, concerning the
injoyment of My dr Lords Corpse & blood, which I felt my
poor heart to hunger after but My shame kept me from
all Expectation of this kind, but in november following
injoy this inExpressabl Grace of the Sacremental body & blood
of my Gracious Lord, what I injoy hear humbled me in the very
dust, in about 6 months after I removed into the Choir house
to live & work in Company with the great Girls, which was
no small blessing for My this was a particular period
to me in Many cases & the faithfull Labour of the holy Ghost
had many Occurances let me see & feel how short I was in the true
knowledg of the Sinner point, tho' I cou'd easily feel when I had 
not done right yet that brought me not to feel myself a Sinner
over My wretched nature, but a never to be forgoten by me


that remarkable choir communion Mar 59 the dr holy Ghost

which was with particular sensations impressed into My
heart at the participations of the holy Corpses here I got

with My dearest Savrour, at the Single Sistrs festival May 59

transaction to my heart, My Enterance into this Choir made
such an impression on me that a through determination
