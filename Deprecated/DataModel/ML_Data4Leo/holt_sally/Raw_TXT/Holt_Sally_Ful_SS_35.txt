Sally Hoult
was born at Bramell in the
Parish of Stockport in Cheshire on
the 25 Day of Feb: 1727 where she Liv'd till
about 1743, when she being stirr'd up in 
her Heart by the Holy ghost to seek after
the Salvation of her soul and sometime af
ter hearing the Testimony of the Brn; & being
convinced of the truth & simplicity of the
gospel Taught by them, Drew accquaintance
with them and in the year 1748 gain'd the
favour to Live in the Single Sisters House in
Duckenfield where she behav'd very well
& was Loved by all. 
Having afterwards along with some more
sisters paid a visit To the Congregation in
Yorkshire she express'd her Mind & hearty
Desire to be a member of that Body.
Hearing of the Single Sisters Here being
built she would say O! that our Saviour may
once grant me the favour to live in that house
In the month of September 1750 she with
the rest of the Oconomy Removing from Duck
enfield to Live in Yorkshire Took her abode in 
Tyre-sell-Hall where she Lived to the Satis
faction both of herself & her sisters, Only
as she was not Receiv'd in the Congregation
would sometimes give her Pain
In the Latter End of the Year 1751 she
begun to be a little Disorder'd by the
Rhoumatism which settled in her Arm & 
in the Spring following it remaining & 


also being attended with a Dropsical dis
ease & a Complication of disorders Ren
der'd her almost incapable of Business.
Her Reception lay very near her Heart &
she Often would sigh & weep after a nearer
fellowship with our dear Saviour & his Church
Thus she continued all Summer & as to
health Better & Worse
In th' month of Novr: 1732 she Obtain'd
the Grace to be a Receiv'd to her Great Joy
& satisfaction.
When we Enter'd in our Choir House
she Chearfully Came with Praising & adoring
the Lamb who had granted her that, she so
long had wish'd for: But she had not Long
Enjoy'd this happiness before her Joy 
in some Respect Interrupted by the re
turn of her Disorder in a much greater
Degree than before & in the beginning
of the Present year the Dropsey siezing
her whole Tabrnacle & her Arm being
quite useless by the Rhoumatism &c
she was not able to help herself there
fore was Oblig'd to take her Room &
now it was she begun to think of going home
& speaking to a Sister about it Said you
will See One of the Poorest & perhaps
Least though tof geting the Favour to go
out of this First, & wish'd that the happy
hour might soon Come. 
She spoke of her Departure with a great
deal of Pleasure Rejoiceing in the full
assurance she felt of the Love of our
Saviour & the Free forgiveness, of all her
sins in his Dear Blood


In May her Father & Mother Come to see
her, she beg'd  them not to be troubl'd about her
telling them she was going to her much 
wish'd for Habitation & to her beloved Lamb
They asking if she had a mind to be Buried
in her own Country she answer'd No! I have
hither to Chosen to Live with the Congregation
I chuse also to Die with them & it is
my Choice to be Buried Here
After they was gone she Looking out
at her window & seeing the Burying Ground
she Express'd her Hearty desire of going
home; But added that she should 
be Extreamly glad to Partake of the
Lords Supper first, for now she felt her
Heart very desirous theref, & of a nearer
fellowshipe with him whose Wound, was
very near & dear to her Heart
Sometime after hearing at a Distance
One sing that Verse I am Drunk for
love & half Departed &c she begun also
to sing & said I know who was the Author of
that Verse I wish I was with him then I 
should also be with my Lamb then I would
think on many whom I Leave behind me but
I will think on my Relations First that
you may be sure
She often repeated her Desire for the 
Sacrament & according to her wish & Desire
was Confirm'd on the 13th of August to 
her Unspeakable Joy: She now thought
she could be Satisfied till the time she in
deed should be Partaker thereof! but grow
ing weaker Continualy; thought the time
very Long so that she Even Number'd
the Days. Being Persuaded to have


Patience she answer'd that she felt her
self very weak & that she was sure she
could not stay Long. On the Eight of Sept:
She was worse than Ever: but one Perceiv'd
more of her Desire by her Looks & Gesture
than by her words for now she spoke
very Little. Ninth
On th' of September being Lds
supper Day she was Extreamly Bad but
very still & Patient Testifying the by her
look the desire of her Heart which was
granted her the same Day By the Bodi
ly Partaking of the Corps & blood of her
Eternal Husband
In a little time after she Express'd
her Longing to go Saying now she was ready,

chearful in the Contemplation of the Love
and Peace of her Lamb. On Saturday the
15 of September She again alter'd & in
