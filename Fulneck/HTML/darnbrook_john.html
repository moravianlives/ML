      <h2>John Darnbrook</h2>
      <p> Course of Life of the S Br<a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000549.html">John Darnbrook</a>, <br /> the first part of which he himself has wrote down,
         <br /> &amp; the latter dictated. <br /> I was born at <a href="#mlpla000180.html">Moreley in the Parish of Battley</a><em>June the 20<sup>th</sup><br /> 1736</em>. My first 13 Years I lived
         with my Parents, which took <br /> care to instruct me in what was religious, to the best of their <br /> knowledge, particularly my Mother, whom I remember, when <a
            href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000536.html">M<sup>r</sup><br /> Ingham</a> and other awakened Men first began preaching, she went <br /> frequently to
         hear them, &amp; a Sermon of <a href="#mlper000366.html">M<sup>r</sup> Whitfield's</a> being <br /> then published, she got it to read. I read the same, it treated <br /> so much of the
         Sufferings of our Sav<sup>r</sup>, that it brought me into <br /> some Concern about my Salvation, </p>
      <p><em>I was then about 5 years old </em><br /> &amp; this was the first Conviction, I had, as much as I can remember <br /> At the End of my <em>13<sup>th</sup> year</em> I was put an
         Apprentice to a very <br /> religious Man in the same town, a Dissenter, in which Way I had <br /> been brought up. Half a Year afterwards my Father departed <br /> this Life. This struck me
         pretty much of first, but I soon for- <br /> got it. The 3 first years of my aprenticeship I spent among young <br /> Company as much as I could, &amp; indeed in that time I got seduced
         <br /> to many bad Things. One Day, when I was at Work by myself in <br /> the Field, a sudden thought came into my Mind that I must <br /> once die &amp; appear before <a href=".html"
            >God</a> to give an Account of my Life &amp; <br /> I thought, if I died in that Condition, I certainly must go to Hell. <br /> I immediately left of my Work &amp; went a kneeled down
         under <br /> a Tree &amp; prayed to <a href=".html">God</a> to forgive me. This was the first Time. <br /> I ever prayed, except such as the Lords Prayer &amp; others learned <br /> out of
         Books. From this time I began to be very religious. I read <br /> many religious Books &amp; prayed 6 or 7 times a day, I entirely <br /> broke <sup>off</sup> from all my old Companions, who
         despised me very much but <br /> the religious people praised me greatly, &amp; this made me very <br /> proud. But all this availed me nothing, all my reading, &amp; <br /> praying brought
         no Peace to my Heart. I was a bound Slave to <br /><a href=".html">Satan</a>, &amp; when Sin presented itself, I had no Power to resist <br /> Some times I used to be a fortnight or 3 weeks
         without coming <br /> into any extraordinary great Sin, this made me think, I had now </p>
      
      PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> made <a href=".html">God</a> amends. But I soon perhaps came into see very Prick of
         <br /> that Sin, which I thought I had conquered. This made me think, <a href=".html">God</a><br /> was displeased with me, &amp; all my Prayers &amp; Readings were of no <br />
         Signification, I must begin anew &amp; be more watchfull, than I <br /> had been hitherto. But with all I could do, Sin had the rule over <br /> me. I think, I spent near 2 Years in this
         miserable Course.</p>
      <p> At <em>Easter in the year 1754</em> (as well as I can remember) I <br /> thought, I would go a hear the Moravians, tho' I had no liking for <br /> them, because I believed them to be
         Roman-Catholicks. However I <br /> went &amp; heard B<sup>r</sup><a href="#mlper000687.html">La Trobe</a> to my great Astonishment Such a Ser- <br /> mon I never had heard in all my Life
         before, I thought directly, <br /> this is the true way to be saved. I went home, &amp; what I had heard <br /> of the Sufferings of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>, &amp; how that Salvation could
         be obtained <br /> no otherwise, than by his ments, Death &amp; Bloodshedding, This <br />wrought much on my Mind all the Week following. When on Sunday <br /> I went again; I was so
         overcome, that I afterwards could not go any <br /> where else. I soon got acquainted with B<sup>r</sup><a href=".html">Lorde</a>, &amp; got a great Love<br /> for him, but he soon after went
         from <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>. I was received into <br /> the Society, attended the Preachings on Sunday constantly &amp; was <br /> often so affected with what I had heard,
         that I many Times in my <br /> Way home retired into a Wood near <a href="#mlper000687.html">Tong</a> &amp; wept before our <br />Sav<sup>r</sup>, that I might enjoy what I had heard. But I
         did not rightly <br /> prosper; for I had got some thing else in view besides my Salvation.</p>
      <p> I had got an Intention to travel, &amp; this engaged my Mind <br /> pretty much, &amp; I put this in Execution, as soon as my Prentice- <br /> ship was out. There happened just at that Time
         two Persons Who <br /> come from <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> to see their Relations at <a href="#mlpla000180.html">Moreley</a>, &amp; I took the <br /> Opportunity to go with them
         at their Return, The one being a married <br /> Person, took me to her House, &amp; it was my Home, till I got a Place, <br /> which I did in ten days time, but it was very hard, so that I
         left <br /> it in 3 months &amp; got another place, which I left in about the same <br /> Time on account of some differences, I went to my first lodging <br /> &amp; stayd there out of Place
         till Doctor<a href="#mlper000695.html">John Holstead</a> returned <br /> from the <a href="#mlpla000167.html">West Indies</a>, where he had been as Surgeon of a Ship <br /> I visited him
         &amp; told him, I should like to go to Sea. He said, he <br /> would recommend me to Captain<a href=".html">Hornsby</a><sup>bound for Greenland</sup>; if he has any Place <br /> that would
         suit me (this Captain was a Person he himself had been with at <a href="#mlpla000182.html">Greenland</a>, before he went to the <a href="#mlpla000167.html">West Indies</a>). </p>
      <p>Accordingly on his Recommendation the Captain took me as his Steward<br /> I went on Board, but all Things were very awkward, having never been <br /> on Board of a Ship before &amp; I knew
         no more about my office than <br /> a Child, but I soon got to understand, that the chief mate was in <br /> that Office the Voyage before. So I made if my business to get acquaint- <br /> ed
         with him <sup>and he</sup><del>with a bottle or 2 of Rum for he Loves Liquor then</del><br /> told me every thing, what I should do &amp; what belonged to my office. Thus <br /> I got into
         the Way pretty well. We sailed from the River <sup>the</sup> latter end of <br /> March, &amp; we were not long out at Sea, before I was sick &amp; confined so <br /> for 15 Days. I thought
         many Times, if I was on Shore, they should be Sai- <br /> lors who would for me, But when I got better, I came thro' pretty well, <br /> as I had no ship's duty to do. It was a very cold
         uncomfortable voyage <br /> for about 4 months we returned very unsuccessfull, having got no more <br /> than one fish; I got from the Ship as soon I could, weary enough of my <br /> first
         Voyage.</p>
      <p>A few weeks after by Accident I went to the <a href="#mlpla000184.html">East India House</a><br /> &amp; met with a Captain who was a shipping people, I asked him if heÂ <br /> wanted people?
         He said, he did &amp; gave me an Order to go on Board. I <br /> immediately went on board &amp; met with a Company of very wicked, curs- <br /> ing &amp; swearing sailors. However we got
         ready &amp; put to Sea; About 2 months <br /> after our Ship's company was seized by turns with a violent Feaver. I<br />also fell sick &amp; it brought me very near my Dissolution. While
         <br /> we were so sick, we hung altogether by ourselves, It was one of the most <br />shocking Times, I have had in all any Life, most of them died cursing <br /> &amp; swearing, they all at
         one Time died, that were sick &amp; left me alone. <br /> I prayed heartily to our Sav<sup>r</sup>, that if He would spare me &amp; bring <br /> me home again, I would be his &amp; live for
         him, But when I got better, <br /> I soon forgot all his goodness &amp; went on a wicked Course with the Rest <br /> of the Sailors, &amp; I some times swore. But amidst all, I had many Con-
         <br /> victions, &amp; I often could not sleep, but wept in my Hammock on <br /> account of the Course I had entered into. When we came to a Port there <br /> was generally nothing seen but
         Wickedness. I remember very well some <br /> times, that I was grieved in myself, has I could not be so bold in <br /> Wickedness, as the Rest of my company, &amp; when I thought, that I
         would <br /> be so wicked as they, I generally had such Convictions, that I could not <br /> do like them. We had a good Voyage but with Regard to Externals <br /> we had it hard some times,
         &amp; were about 6 Months without Bread, <br /> living on Rice. On Account of the Length of the voyage we also </p>
      
      PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> were obliged to take in old Stores in the <a
            href="#mlpla000185.html">East Indies</a> which were very bad &amp; <br /> rusty thro &amp; thro. But after 2 years &amp; 3 months we arrived at <a href="#mlpla000186.html">Spithead</a>;
         &amp; <br /> there made myself sick to spare myself from the press . When the people were <br /> all pressed, I got on Shore and came by so force. I lived there with my Friends <br /> till
         the ship was paid off. &amp; then according to my Resolution of going to Sea <br /> no more, I began to look for a Place where I could earn my Bread &amp; by <br /> the Help of a Friend I got
         a good one in <a href="#mlpla000357.html">Cheapside</a>, where I lived very <br /> agreeably 6 months &amp; I found they had great confidence towards me.</p>
      <p> But the ship beginning to be fitted out again, <del>where</del><sup>which</sup> I had been with <br /> before, it made me very unsettled in my Mind &amp; I got a desire to go to <br /> Sea
         again. But I did not know, what Excuse to make, to get away <br /> from the Place, as had no fault to find with any thing I had Re- <br /> course to Stratagem. I ordered one of my companions,
         that he should come <br /> dressed like an officer of a Man of War, &amp; enquire for me, that it <br /> might appear, as if he had an Intention to press me. I ordered it so, <br /> that he
         should come at an exact Hour, in order that I might be out <br /> of the Way. Accordingly he came. As soon as he was gone, then my <br /> Master called me &amp; told me, that he was afraid,
         the officer would re- <br /> turn again. I told him, I was under some Apprehension of being <br /> pressed. He desired that I would get ready, &amp; should go away &amp; <br /> not be
         pressed, if possible. When he settled with me about my <br /> Wages, he gave me 1/2 a guinea more than was due to me. So I came <br />by which means I came away with many good Wishes. Yet I
         was condemned <br /> for acting so unuprightly, besides that I had left my Place &amp; did <br /> not know, whether I could get voyage or not to the <a href="#mlpla000185.html">East
            Indies</a>, <br /> I went to the <a href="#mlpla000184.html">India House</a> &amp; spoke to Captain<a href=".html">Wilson</a>, with whom <br /> had been before, &amp; desired him to
         recommend me as Mid-shipman<br /> to Captain<a href=".html">Jackson</a>, that was to succeed him. He was very friendly<br />and promised that he would do it. &amp; he was as good as his
         Words. <br /> I then began to get ready suitable for that Station, as well as I <br /> could. And when I had got my Necessaries I had not much Money <br /> to spare, to trade with. A gentle
         Woman, that wanted some Things <br /> from the <a href="#mlpla000185.html">East Indies</a>, advanced me 6 Guineas in hand, which I <br /> laid out in such Merchandises, as I thought, would
         suit the best <br /> in <a href="#mlpla000187.html">India</a>. He soon got ready I had a very prosperous voyage <br /> from <a href="#mlpla000072.html">England</a> to <a
            href="#mlpla000358.html">Madras</a> in 4 Months, where I disposed of my <br /> Effects to good Advantage., I then bought such Commodities, which <br /> I thought would suit for <a
            href="#mlpla000189.html">China</a> which likewise turned out to </p>
      <p> good Advantage &amp; what Money I had, I laid out in China-goods &amp; <br />brought them home, After 18 months we arrived again at <a href="#mlpla000190.html">Plymouth</a><br /> where I
         escaped the pressing &amp; came by Land to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> (when the <br /> ship has round to London Spaind, I found that I had 10 pounds to receive for Goods <br />
         that a Person had disposed of in the Passage. I afterwards went on <br /> Board from Day to day &amp; some Times sold from Board &amp; brought on <br /> shore till got off all my effects. I
         found myself worth a consider- <br /> able Sum of Money. That made me think of no other way of life, than <br /> Seafaring Life <del>as I had such a good success prtazpreeadee, etenne, an
            aypraan to gave amndin and of urantiraf its Shad subled</del> After I had settled all my Affairs with the <br /> Ship for that Voyage, I paid a Visit to <a href="#mlpla000084.html"
            >Yorkshire</a>, to see my Mother <br /> where I went on Sunday to <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, &amp; was so laid hold of in the Preach- <br /> ing, that I had gladly staid, if
         I had known, how I should got my Living. <br />In about 5 Weeks I returned to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, where I went to see about the <br /> Ship, &amp; found, it would be some
         Months, before she would be fitteded out <br /> again. I waited the Time, but then some Objections arose between <br /> the Captain &amp; me, &amp; I resolved positively, that I would go to
         Sea no more <br /> I acquainted my Friends with my Resolution &amp; advised with them, what <br /> I should take to? I had then spent all my Money. They agreed to advance <br /> me 30 pounds,
         that I could procure me a little Shop, for which I had to <br /> give then Bond &amp; Judgment. We soon met with a little Shop, in which <br /> I entered. Soon afterwards I was arrested by a
         person, that I owed <br /> 40 shillings to, &amp; went to the <a href=".html">Sponging House</a>, where I wrote a Letter to <br /> my Friend &amp; told him any Circumstances. He went directly
         &amp; put <br /> the Bond &amp; Judgment in Force, &amp; took all I had &amp; came to me next <br /> Morning &amp; paid the Money, for which I was arrested, &amp; set me at <br /> Liberty. I
         had now no home, but went some Times to one Friend's <br /> House, &amp; some times to another, where I had been formerly acquainted. <br /> But this I could not do very long, &amp; it came
         so far, that I sufferedÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  till to the Bareness of Life. One Day I met in the street one of <br /> the Family, that I had the Money from, he invited me to go to
         their <br /> House, &amp; they were hearty &amp; friendly with me, &amp; seemed to pity my <br /> Circumstances, I served in their Shop a few Weeks, &amp; then they <br /> hired me as a
         yearly Servant. I lived there very agreeably, &amp; some <br /> years ago, they did write to me to <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, that I should come <sup>again</sup> &amp; live
         <br /> with them. After some Time I called at a <a href=".html">Barber's Shop</a> to get <br /> shaved pretty late in the Evening; while I sat there, I thought I </p>
      
      PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> was going
         to die. I got up &amp; said, I was very bad; but no Body gave me any Answer. <br /> I stood at the Door, till some Body, who was before me, was shaved; then I got in &amp; <br /> was shaved,
         I went home very heavy &amp; told our people, I was not well. <br /> They advised me to get some Supper, which might help me, I went to <br /> Bed &amp; in the Morning still found myself the
         same. I begun to re- <br /> flect on my present State, for I had not minded Religion for a long <br /> Time; I thought, it was a Punishment from <a href=".html">God</a> for my bad Course.
         <br /> Accordingly to make Amends, I thought, I would go once on Sunday <br /> to some Place of Worship; but the other Part of the Sunday I would <br /> walk about and fake my Pleasure, as I
         had done before, I went on so <br /> for some Time, but it did not help me. Then I thought, I would go <br /> both the Forenoon &amp; Aftemoon to Worship, yet still I found no Ease. <br /> I
         begun to be so terrified, that I thought, I should b``e in <a href=".html">Hell</a> every <br /> Moment. When had a Pen in my Hand to write a Bill of Parcel, <br /> I flung it away when I had
         done with it, &amp; thought, I should be in <br /><a href=".html">Hell</a>, before I should want it any more. When I went out, I often <br /> thought, I should drop down dead in the Street.
         It came so far, that <br /> my Appetite left me &amp; I could get no Sleep, I used to awake in <br />Frights &amp; get up. I read some Times in the Bible, but I thought <br /> every Word
         seemed a Sentence against me; I thought, I had sinned <br /> against the holy Ghost; therefore I had nothing to expect but <a href=".html">Hell</a><br /> &amp; Judgment. I was in that
         Distress in more than 2 Months. One <br /> Sunday I went to <a href="#mlpla000004.html">Fetterlane Chappel</a>. When I heard some Courses of <br /> Lives similar to my own, it gave me great
         Hopes, when I heard <br /> how they were redeemed by the Blood &amp; Wounds of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>, I went <br /> Home full of Hope, that I should soon be released. Next Day in <br />
         the Forenoon, when I was going thro a narrow Passage near <br /><a href=".html">Spitalfields Church</a>, it came into my Mind, that there was Mercy<br /> in <a href=".html">Jesus</a> for
         every believing Soul. In that Moment I believed, &amp; <br /> the Love of <a href=".html">God</a> was <sup>shed</sup><del>spread</del> abroad in my Heart. I saw <a href=".html">Jesus</a> in
         <br /> his crucified form quite clear, who had redeemed me from all my <br /> Sins. I dont know, how I afterwards got home, Every Body was dear<br /> to me I loved every one, I would gladly
         have imparted unto them <br /> of what I enjoyed. I went on in that Enjoyment for some Time &amp; <br /> thought, since I was come to the knowledge of our Sav<sup>r,</sup> that I <br />
         should no more feel the Depravity of my own sinfull Nature, But <br /> I found my sinfull Nature still, &amp; was obliged to apply to our <br />Sav<sup>r</sup> for his Grace to preserve me,
         which he did from time to time </p>
      <p> I began to have a longingdesire, to become acquainted with <br /> the B<sup>rn</sup>, as I believed, they were the only people, which I belonged to. <br /> Accordingly I began to go
         frequently on Sundays to <a href="mlpla000004.html">Fetterlane</a>. I went <br /> so long, till B<sup>r</sup><a href=".html">Brodersen</a> took Notice of me in the Preaching &amp; made <br />
         it out with one of the S. B<sup>rn</sup>, that he should speak with me at <br /> the first Opportunity. Accordingly he bid me a good Day after the <br /> Preaching &amp; asked me, where I was
         agoing? I told him I was agoing <br /> towards <a href="#mlpla000192.html">Bishopsgate Street</a>. He said he was agoing that Way too <br /> &amp; desired my Company. He said, he had
         observed, that I frequented <br /> their Preachings for some Time, &amp; inquired, if I knew any thing about <br /> the B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; I told him, yes. I knew the B<sup>rn</sup> in <a
            href="mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a> &amp; I knew Br<br /><a href=".html">Brodersen</a> too, &amp; had spoken with him formerly. I told him, I had often <br /> fixed a Day, that I would go
         &amp; speak with him again. He asked, if I <br /> should rule to speak with him, &amp; if it would suit me that time, if <br /> I had an Opportunity for it? I answered: yes, I had no
         objection to it <br /> So we turned back both together &amp; went to Roll's Buildings. As soonÂ <br /> as we got into the House, we met B<sup>r</sup><a href=".html">Brodersen</a> in the
         Passage, &amp; <br /> he took me into his Room &amp; we had some pretty Conversation together. <br /> The Choir Liturgy was going to begin, &amp; he gave one Leave to be at <br /> it. I was
         so melted, that I wept all the Time, often spending some <br /> part of the Evening with the S. B<sup>rn</sup>. I returned home very thank- <br /> full for the kind Reception, that I met
         with. From that Time, I went <br /> every Sunday to the S Brn, which was the chief Opportunity that I had. <br /> Some Time after I petitioned for Reception into the Cong<sup>n</sup>, which
         <br />Blessing was granted me <em>January the 13<sup>th</sup> 1766</em> I entered into <br /> a Covenant that time with our Sav<sup>r</sup> to be his for ever I spent my <br /> time for the
         most part in a very happy Track of Grace, considering <br /> my Situation, wherein I was, &amp; I had many near Visits of our Sav<sup>r</sup>, <br /> which made my Time very pleasant. Tho' I
         felt naturally my de- <br /> praved human Nature, but I applied to him &amp; got preserved. When <br />B<sup>r</sup>. <a href=".html">Abraham</a> returned from the Provincial Synod at <a
            href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, he <br /> acquainted me that they had made it out in a Conference that if I did <br /> accept of it, I should go to <a href="#mlpla000003.html"
            >Fulneck</a> &amp; be employed in the <a href=".html">Con<sup>g</sup> Shop</a><br /> I told him I had no Choice in it , I would go anywhere. Accordingly, as <br /> soon as I could make
         things suitable, I left my place &amp; set out from <br /><a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> Feb<sup>r</sup> the 17<sup>th</sup> 1764 &amp; arrived at Fulneck the 22<sup>nd</sup> of the
         same month<br /> to my great Joy.</p>
      <p>Thus far his own Words. <br /> By dictating his Course of life, he <sup>often</sup> said, I thought there was some </p>
      
      PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> Thing in the World, which I must experience, but I found,
         there was nothing <br /> but fantom, Now often have I thought of <a href="mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a> &amp; wished me to be <br /> there, when I was uneasy, which was very often.</p>
      <p><br /> His Course here was solid, he served faithfully in the Shop &amp; <br /> was legitimated among B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; Strangers. His Connexion &amp; Converse <br /> with our dear
            Sav<sup>r</sup> was real, but in Stilness. He was admitted here <br /> to the holy Sacrament<em>May the 23<sup>d</sup> 1767</em>, which was a real Grace to <br /> Him. &amp; as often as he
         fed afterwards with the Cong<sup>n</sup> on the Body &amp; <br /> Blood of <a href=".html">Jesus</a> in the holy Sacrament, he enjoyed it as a poor Sinner <br /> who thought himself very
         unworthy of this great Grace, but felt at <br /> the same time that he stood very much in Need of it, &amp; that he could <br /> not do without. And so, he always got new Strength &amp; Life
         out of the <br /> Wounds of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>. When he was spoken with previous to the holy Sa- <br /> crament he was not of many Words, but one perceived clearly, that his <br />
         Heart did live in the Sufterings of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>. All the Meetings he en- <br /> joyed both in the Cong<sup>n</sup> &amp; his Choir proved a Blessing to him; the <br /> Doctrinal
         Day we had last Novemb<sup>r</sup>, was very blessed to him &amp; he <br /> afterwards told, that he enjoyed a particular Nearness of our Sav<sup>r</sup>Â at <br /> the Cup of Covenant.
            <em>Last Year</em> he was made and a Candidate for <br /> the <a href="mlpla000185.html">East Indies</a>, which he accepted of: for he was very willing to serve <br /> our Sav<sup>r</sup>,
         wheresoever his Service should require it, tho' on Account of <br /> his weakly Constitution he had but little Hopes to be of any Use in the <br /> Service of our Sav<sup>r</sup> among the
         Heathen. That time he came among the <br /> Intercessors, which was very weighty to him. But our Sav<sup>r</sup>, who was <br />pleased with his Willingness to serve him, had other thoughts
         about him, <br />He grew weaker from time to time, &amp; <em>in the Beginning of Decemb<sup>r</sup></em> he <br /> was obliged to move into the <a href=".html">Sick Room</a>. First we did not
         think, that <br /> he would go home of this Opportunity, but he soon thought so &amp; was quite <br /> set upon going home. Here he had a sabbatical time in the Nearness &amp; <br /> converse
         with our Sav<sup>r</sup><sup>tho; it was a Shool-Time for him too, in which he had to learn many Lessons &amp; to speak thoroughly with our dr.Savr. about many Things.</sup> Once he said:
         tho' our Sav<sup>r</sup> has had so great a <br />Mercy upon me, yet I feel myself often so indifferent towards Him, which <br /> is the greatest Pain, I have in the <a href=".html">Sick
            Room</a>; at which he wept very much. <br /> But he soon was comforted again &amp; cheared by a gracious Look of our Saviour.<br /> He himself dictated his Course of Life to
            B<sup>r</sup><a href=".html">Martens</a>, &amp; when he had done <br /> therewith, <del>to</del> which was last Friday, he made Haste to meet his etemal <br /> Bridegroom. He had it very
         easy in his Sickness: the day before his going home <br /> he once complained, saying: Dear Sav<sup>r</sup>! it is too hard for me; but he soon <br /> got it easier. He was present to himself
         to the last Moment, when the <br />Blessings of his Choir &amp; the Congreg<sup>n</sup> was imparted unto him during a<br />sweet <sup>feeling</sup>of our Sav<sup>rs</sup> Nearness, &amp;
         soon after his Soul departed into the <br /> arms &amp; Bosom of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>, <em>last Tuesday about 7 o'Clock in the Morning, viz <br /> Feby the 6<sup>th</sup> 1770</em> in
         the 34<sup>th</sup> year of his Age.Â <br />Â  Â  Â  Praise to thee, our God, be brought for this Sinner redeemed with thy Blood.</p></body>
