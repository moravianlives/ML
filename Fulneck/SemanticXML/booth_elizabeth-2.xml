					Elizh Booth <lb/>
					I was born Sep<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> 22 1735 at <placeName key="Mirfield" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mirfield">Mirfeild</placeName> My parents <lb/>
					belonged The Church of Eng<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>, in My younger y<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> <lb/>
					I came into a Concern about My Salvation &amp; according <lb/>
					to my way of Thinking had it very much at heart <lb/>
					to please the Lord in hopes that he wou'd save <lb/>
					me, in My 6 year I had a particular Impression <lb/>
					from a dream were I saw our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in My room I <lb/>
					went to him &amp; askd him to bless me me, he told me <lb/>
					 I must be dipt in a fountain &amp; then I shoud be his <lb/>
					which promise I never forgot</p>
					<p>
					when The B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> came to preach at <persName key="Thornhill, West Yorkshire" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thornhill,_West_Yorkshire" cert="low">Fox rojd</persName> I went <lb/>
					thither with my Mother &amp; got a Love for them <lb/>
					when B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Helt came to have the care of the <lb/>
					Children His Meeting was a great <del>peculiarly</del> <add place="above">a great</add> blessed to <lb/>
					my heart &amp; in particular when he Spoak of our <lb/>
					Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> death &amp; Suffering to purchas our Salvation <lb/>
					I was very much affected thereby &amp; <del>M &amp;</del> my heart <lb/>
					Melted into Tears, as I grew older I felt my corruption <lb/>
					&amp; the great propensity I had to Sin Made me very <lb/>
					dark &amp; Miserable as I thought no one was so Spoilt <lb/>
					&amp; full of Evil as I felt My Self altho I had a Love <lb/>
					for Sin yet through disstress of mind I was fridened <lb/>
					from <add place="above">commiting of</add> gross Sins &amp; instead of going to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as a  <lb/>
					Sinner I fell to Self working &amp; striving to belief <lb/>
					but coud attain no consolation for my Soul by it. <lb/>
					I often use<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> to walk alone &amp; pour out my concerns before <lb/>
					the Lord but Still preceived that my Missery increased <lb/>
					&amp; felt as If I shoud be condemd &amp; lost forever beleiving <lb/>
					it Impossable for our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to have Mercy upon such <lb/>
					a wretch as Me in this My Disstress<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Condition

					I was visited by the Sisters to them I Spoke My whole <lb/>
					heart as well as I cou'd &amp; beg'd them to tell me If there <lb/>
					was Grace &amp; Mercy for me they comforted &amp; incouraged <lb/>
					me Much &amp; told me that it was our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Grace that  <lb/>
					made such deep disscoveries of my Sinfulness that <lb/>
					he Might Heal &amp; Save Me, but I being of a reasoning  <lb/>
					turn of Mind Soon doubted of the realitie of this &amp; woud <lb/>
					not be comforted any other way then by our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb/>
					Manifesting himself personably to My heart as <lb/>
					Clearly as If I saw him with My bodily Eyes <lb/>
					I wou'd believe my Sins forgiven.</p>
					<p>
					I continued in a heavy Course for a Considerable <lb/>
					Time through My unbeleive of <del>Heart</del> not withstanding <lb/>
					my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> never Left me his poor Child but <lb/>
					followed me with unwearied patience but in  <lb/>
					My 17 year I began to grow tired of my own attempts <lb/>
					to help my Self &amp; thought If perish I will now perish <lb/>
					at My Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> feet</p>
					<p>
					one day when I was praying our <lb/>
					Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to take me as I am I had no sooner given my <lb/>
					Self into <add place="above">the hands of</add> my redeemer, but he was pleased to mani <lb/>
					fest himself to me, &amp; Stood So Clearly before My heart <lb/>
					&amp; Eyes in His wound figure so that I was quite Struck <lb/>
					&amp; overcome with his Beauty. here I felt the <unclear>assurance</unclear> <lb/>
					of the forgiveness of all My Sins by which My great distress <lb/>
					of heart &amp; mind was quite removed Oh how I felt I shall <lb/>
					never forget my heart was quite captivated by my bloody <lb/>
					freind who was now becomed my Only Object I can <lb/>
					never Express in words what peace &amp; Life My poor <lb/>
					heart injoyd for I Say of a truth when in his <lb/>
					blood I saw him Swim a Small drop I did get, which free<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> <lb/>
					him to me me to him the first time that we meet,
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					After This a desire arose in My heart to be receivd <lb/>
					into The congregation tho' I felt My Self very unworthy <lb/>
					of that Grace Therefore <add place="above">I said nothing of it to my Labourer</add> I Spoke Childlikely to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb/>
					about it leaving it at the Same Time to his decision <lb/>
					being very Timerous of myself Least Least I  <lb/>
					Shou<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not <del>prove</del> <add place="above">answer</add> &amp; faithfull <del>to that happy lot of Grace</del> to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, &amp; his people <lb/>
					however not withstanding all my unstillness our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grantd <lb/>
					Me that favour on nov. 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1752 here I gave My Self anew <lb/>
					to become a joy unto our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; his congregation in the <lb/>
					beginning of the year 53 I <del>had</del> <add place="above">recieved</add> the <gap reason="illegible"/> news <del>brought</del> <lb/>
					Me, that I had leave to come into The Choirhouse &amp; My long <lb/>
					wish<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> for desire was attaind on feb 3. And on the 13 of aug<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> <lb/>
					I was receved into The Single S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Choir <del>on this day</del> <add place="above">on this</add> to me</p>
					<p>
					Ever Memorable day I devoted myself anew in <lb/>
					with Soul &amp; body to My Manhood only Spouse to <lb/>
					become a true virgin to him</p>
					<p>
					in the year 53 Sep<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> 9 I had the unspeakable Grace <lb/>
					to become a participant of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> body &amp; blood in <lb/>
					the holy Communon, This melted me like wax in <lb/>
					the dust <del>befe</del> at My Bridegooms feet Thus I went <lb/>
					on in a Cherefull happy Manner &amp; in 1754 <lb/>
					when Our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> papa &amp; Mamagen was hear I had <lb/>
					the favour to be present at that so remarkable <lb/>
					Choir Communion what that proved to My heart <lb/>
					Im not able to disscribe in words, from that time on <lb/>
