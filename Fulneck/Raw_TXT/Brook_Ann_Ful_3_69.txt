The Course of Life of the Single Sistr Ann Brook
Of which she has left the following:
I was Born in the Parish of
Birstal, in Yorkshire, and Babtiz'd by Br Held, in Gumersal
Chappel. My parrents took me with them to the meetings
as soon as I cou'd go, and when the school was settled there,
I went to it. Br Watson kept a meeting on this Ocassion to
the Children, Concerning the aim of this School, now begun with
them, wherein I felt our Savr very near my heart and the
time I spent amongst the Childn as also the meetings were a real
Blessing to me, tho' I was sometimes selfwill'd & Greiv'd the
Sistr who kept the school, In my 13 year I was Recd into the
Great Girls Choir which was also a Blessing to me. My desire
now was to go to live with the Sistrs, but Circumstances not
permitting me at that time, I got into a more indiferent way,
and rather got a likeing to the world, which my Parrents
Perceiving with Concern, Sought Admission for me to
the Oeconomy, which was granted soon, and I accordingly
mov'd into The Little Moor Oeconimy Septr ye 3 1768
I was verry thankfull for it, and felt myself Quite at home
from the very first, but my Disposition being very hasty,
Caus'd me often some uneasiness, as I did not know how to be
a Sinner and as such to come thro', I spoke to the the Sistrs
Concerning this my trouble, and found thro' their advice, Comfort
and Satisfaction from our Saviour. In my 17 year I was Recd
into the Sistrs Choir, which prov'd a new School for my heart,
wherein I wish'd to spend my time more to Our Savrs Satisfaction
then I had done in my Girls years, being now more and more
Conscious of my own Poverty, which made the Grace bestow'd
on me the Greater, When to my Great Joy I was recd into the
Congn Febry ye 26 1769


This Bow'd me in the dust before my dearest Saviour, that he cou'd
So graciously accept such a One as I was, and the favour Granted
me Septr ye 8 1771 when I was Spectator at the Holy Communion
Confirm'd my Confidence in him, that he would Bring me to the
full injoyment of his dear Person, and all he had Merited
for me
Thus for our Late Sistrs Own Account
She took her illness in the beggining of Novbr 1771 which we
thought to be a bad Cold, but linger'd for some time without
much alteration till in the beggining of December, when she Grew
worse, She had Spent her time in stillness so far concerning
her illness, but then told her Sistrs, that she had spoken
with Our Saviour, about all her matters, what had past
before She came here, as well as Since, Of which she mentiond
Several Particulars, Saying, I wou'd not have any thing left
betwixt my dearest Savr and me, Being ask'd if She believ'd
Our Savr wou'd take her to himself at this time, She said,
It is not yet clear to me, but I feel Quite Resign'd, I feel
nothing betwixt him and me that disturbs me, and added
if there is still any thing left, I cou'd like him to show it me,
that so nothing might hinder me from the injoyment of him
Her Longing after the injoyment of the Lords Body and Blood
in the Holy Sacrament seemed to be now her only concern.
Which she injoy'd on the 10 of December, to her great Joy,
She lay Quite still for a Considerable time, look'd quite Chearfull
and Satisfied, her Serene Countenance bespoke the sencible injoyment
she felt of her Dearest Lords nearness, which she express'd
by saying; What a good and Loving Saviour have I;
The next Day she Lay very still, till in the night when her
pain was very Violent, During which she often pray'd


Our Savr to help her, and Preserve her Sences, towards
Morning she grew a little Delirous but all she said was
about our savr and how happy she was in Him, which
her look at the same time testified to all around her, she
had intervals when her pain a little abated that she came
More to herself, On the 14 the Choir Helper, Blest her to
her happy departure, during an inexpressible feeling of Our
Dr Savrs nearness, she grew weaker and weaker, and was
not able to say much, But, ;O come Dr Savr take me;
the Sooner the Better; and thus Continued looking out
with longing for the Happy Moment; till on the 18 in
the Morning between 8 and 9 oclock, her happy soul
took flight into the Arms of her Eternal Bridegroom
in the 20th year of her age, with a sweet feeling
of the Peace of God
