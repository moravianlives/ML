						left the following short account, which she dictated <date type="dictated" when-iso="1813-9-13">Sept 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1813</date>. I was born <date
							when-iso="1743-11-19">Oct 19th 1743</date> in <placeName>Idle</placeName>, in my <date when-iso="1746" cert="medium">3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> year</date> I moved with
						my parents into <placeName>Pudsey</placeName>, they belonging to the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> as soon as I was old
						enough took me to the Childrens meeting, where I remem ber as a very little Child being told to pray to our <persName type="deity">Saviour</persName> to wash our hearts in his
						blood, and when I came home, I often went into a corner, and repeated these words as well as I could. <date when-iso="1756-03-25">March 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							1756</date> I was added to the <orgName en="greater girls choir">great Girls Choir</orgName>, which day proved a great blessing to me, and from that time I felt an <name

					<p> granted to me <date when-iso="1759-05-21">May 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1759</date>. I was now very happy and comfort able, felt quite at home, and thought I wanted
						nothing more. The <date when-iso="1759-11-13">13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Nov. the same year</date> I was <name event="reception">rec&apos;d into the Cong<hi
								rend="superscript">n</hi></name> with 26 others; having made no previous application for this favour, I was much struck when my name was read in the Caple, but I <name
							type="emotion">prayed fervently</name> to our <persName ref="diety">Saviour</persName> that his aim might be obtained with me. <date when-iso="1760-01-18">Jan. 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> 1760</date> I was spectator at the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> from this time till the <date when-iso="1760-08-29">29<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of Aug. the same year</date>, when <name event="sacrament">I had the favour to enjoy this sacramental food for the first time</name>, was a
						period which I shall never forget, when I learned to know my own depravity and sinfulness, and our <persName type="deity">Saviour</persName> manifested himself to </p>
					<p> my heart in a particular manner as my <roleName type="honorific">Redeemer</roleName>. I learned to know that without him I could do nothing, which proved a good and holesome
						School to me, and after this I went on for sometime in a <name type="emotion">happy course</name>. In my <date when-iso="1754" cert="medium">21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>
							year</date>, <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<persName>Nitshman</persName> spoke individually with our whole <orgName>Choir</orgName>, it has always been impressed on my mind how fer vently he recommended me to our
							<persName type="deity">Saviour</persName>. After the <name event="religious">Synod</name> in <date when-iso="1764">1764</date> was a very searching time in this
								<orgName>Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, which was also to me of great importance, I sensibly felt how short I fell of what I ought to be, which humbled me
						at the <roleName type="honorific">Lords</roleName> feet to seek grace and pardon, and when the whole <orgName>Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> had missed the H.

					<p> favour to meet at the <roleName type="honorific">Lords</roleName> table words cannot express. To say much more concerning my pilgrimage here below, I am not able, nor has any
						thing very striking accur red, my <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> has dealt <del>has</del> with me as a kind and tender Father, lead me on by degrees as I was
						able to bear it, and kept his faithful hand over me in many trying hours of temptation. When I therefore now look back how I have spent my time, my only plea is;
							&quot;<persName type="deity">God</persName> be merciful to me a sinner.&quot; I find abundent <name type="emotion">cause to thank and adore</name> my kind <roleName
							type="honorific">Redeemer</roleName> for all his love and faith fulness towards me in every respect; in my imply he has blessed me that I have wanted for nothing and often
						when I was sweeping the Sleeproom, and being with </p>
					<p> my <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> alone, I have had many happy hours, when I could simply lay my case before him. Now when I am not able to do any thing, the
						time will now and then apear long to me, but I pray to him to strenghten my faith and confidence, and to prepare me for his heavenly kingdom, I am <name type="emotion">very
							thankful</name> that I am able to attend the meetings, which prove a great comfort and refreshment to my heart. </p>

					<p>Our late <roleName type="honorific">S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> did not think when she dictated this, that she still should remain so long in this vale of tears,
						her patience was often tried, but she prayed earnest ly to the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> for help and sup port; as long <del>as long</del> as she was able, she
						faithfully attended the <placeName>Chaple</placeName>, where she found food and </p>

					<p> nourishment for her hungry soul and with great thankfulness for the blessings she now injoyed she often lamented, that she in former days had not made better use of those
						priviledges, she often said, that during her late affiliation she was in a close School, where our <persName type="dietey">Saviour</persName> by his good spirit pointed out to
						how many things, which led to deep self examina tion; and here she experienced now, that he who wounds, can also heal the sins with soul, and speak pardon and peace to the
						troubled mind, and thanked the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> with many tears, for what he had done for her. In <date when-iso="1815-07">July last year</date>, she
						was <name health="disease">seized with a paralytick strook</name>, whereby she was deprived of nearly all the use of her limbs, this was </p>
					<p> an other hard trial, but the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> gave her grace to bear this and other afflictions with patience, tho&apos; she often longed for the time
						to be with him; she would frequently say, o what happiness awaits me, when I shall see my <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> face to face, O what endless mercy, that
						he will receive such a poor and worth sinner as I am. The <date when-iso="1816-03-12">12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Last.</date> she was according to her desire blessed for
						her departure and com mended to the friend of her soul, and the <date when-iso="1816-03-15">15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></date> early in the morning it pleased our
							<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> to call her hence, to rest with him for ever more. Aged 72 years. 5 Months. </p>
