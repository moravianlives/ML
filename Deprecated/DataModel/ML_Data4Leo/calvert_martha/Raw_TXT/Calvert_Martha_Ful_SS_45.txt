The single Sr Martha Calvert who
departed this life March 15th 1816,
has left the following short account,
which she dictated Sept 13th 1813.
I was born Oct 19th 1743 in Idle,
in my 3d year I moved with my
parents into Pudsey, they belonging
to the Brns Congn as soon as I
was old enough took me to the 
Childrens meeting, where I remem
ber as a very little Child being
told to pray to our Saviour to 
wash our hearts in his blood,
and when I came home, I 
often went into a corner, and
repeated these words as well as
I could. March 25th 1756 I 
was added to the great Girls Choir,
which day proved a great blessing
to me, and from that time I 
felt an earnest desire to come to 
live in Fulnek, this favour was


granted to me May 21st 1759. I 
was now very happy and comfort
able, felt quite at home, and 
thought I wanted nothing more.
The 13th of Nov. the same year I
was rec'd into the Congn with 26
others; having made no previous 
application for this favour, I 
was much struck when my name
was read in the Caple, but I 
prayed fervently to our Saviour
that his aim might be obtained
with me. Jan. 18th 1760 I was 
spectator at the H. Comn from
this time till the 29th of Aug.
the same year, when I had the 
favour to enjoy this sacramental
food for the first time, was a 
period which I shall never forget,
when I learned to know my own 
depravity and sinfulness, and our
Saviour manifested himself to


my heart in a particular manner as
my Redeemer. I learned to know
that without him I could do nothing,
which proved a good and holesome
School to me, and after this I 
went on for sometime in a hap
py course. In my 21st year, Br
Nitshman spoke individually with 
our whole Choir, it has always been
impressed on my mind how fer
vently he recommended me to our
Saviour. After the Synod in 1764
was a very searching time in this 
Congn, which was also to me of great
importance, I sensibly felt how
short I fell of what I ought to
be, which humbled me at the Lords
feet to seek grace and pardon, and 
when the whole Congn had missed
the H. Comn for 3 successive 
times, the feeling which pervaded
us all when we again had the


favour to meet at the Lords table
words cannot express. To say much
more concerning my pilgrimage
here below, I am not able, nor
has any thing very striking accur
red, my Saviour has dealt has
with me as a kind and tender
Father, lead me on by degrees
as I was able to bear it, and 
kept his faithful hand over me
in many trying hours of temptation.
When I therefore now look back
how I have spent my time, my
only plea is; "God be merciful to
me a sinner." I find abundent
cause to thank and adore my kind
Redeemer for all his love and faith
fulness towards me in every respect;
in my imply he has blessed me
that I have wanted for nothing 
and often when I was sweeping
the Sleeproom, and being with


my Saviour alone, I have had many
happy hours, when I could simply
lay my case before him. Now
when I am not able to do any
thing, the time will now and then
apear long to me, but I pray
to him to strenghten my faith and
confidence, and to prepare me
for his heavenly kingdom, I am
very thankful that I am able
to attend the meetings, which prove
a great comfort and refreshment
to my heart.
Our late Sr did not think when 
she dictated this, that she still
should remain so long in this
vale of tears, her patience was
often tried, but she prayed earnest
ly to the Lord for help and sup
port; as long as long as she was
able, she faithfully attended the 
Chaple, where she found food and 


an other hard trial, but the Lord
gave her grace to bear this and 
other afflictions with patience, 
tho' she often longed for the time 
to be with him, she would fre
quently say, o what happiness awaits
me, when I
