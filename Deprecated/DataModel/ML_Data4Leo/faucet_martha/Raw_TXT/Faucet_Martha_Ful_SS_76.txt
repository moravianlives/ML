The Course of Life of Martha Fawset
Martha Fawset was born in Wike in the year 1751
May ye 27th and Baptized June ye 4th at Scholes by Br Latrobe
She was a Child that from her earlist years took great delight in learning
Verses and this was one great reason why she had such pleasure in
going to the Childrens School which was at that time kept by Sister
Betty Holdaworth she had a perticular love for her insomuch that when
the Sister went away it cost her many Tears, in the time of her going to
School the had two Fitts, but grow better, in the year 1763 March
the 25th she was taken into the great Girls Choir which was a new
School to her she was of a very lively dispossion which when she
began to feel a little of her self she was some times concernd about
it and one night in perticular she wept to her Mother and
said she wish'd it cou'd be made possable for her to go and live
some were among the Sisters, her Mother comforted her telling her it
wou'd be made possible and that she shou'd only give her Heart to
our Saviour and she wou'd take care about that, and thus for the 
present she was made satisfy'd, the first time after that she
came to Fulneck she desird her Labrous to give her leave to go 
and live at the little Oeconomy with the Sister Mary Wight 
soon after
she was rejoiced with the News that she had
now leave to go and live with them Sisters where upon she went
with great Satisfaction Jany ye 30 1765 and became soon satis
fy'd and quite at home and was very chearfull among the Sisters
there tho' her uncommon lively turn some times occasiond the Sisters 
to reprove her yet not with standing it was very perceptable that 
that she had some times very serious reflections, one time in 
perticular as the sisters was conversing together in aband like way
she put the question to them if they thought that the Angels had
the same share in our Saviours redemtion as the human 


Creature had, and when they answerd her that he did not dye
for the Angels for they was not fallen as we was for they was
no sinners, and when they repeated that verse.
Glory be unto that heart so bloody that I poor and sinfull
thing, Not adapted to an Angles body But a human with its
Sting Go on smelling tasting feeling gaping ye she was almost
as in an Extasy, some time after it was percievd that she began
to be more thought full and woud say do let us give our Selves
entirely up to our Saviour and then we shall all be happy
and she began to have great pleasure in going to her bands
and clases and all her ohoer opertunitys which otherway she
according to her own declareation us'd to have a little fear for
because she found that with all she still got not such an
intire heart as our Savr and her Labroures cou'd have wish'd
her, but in this respect she became quite alter'd for she hard
ly coud wait the time when she was to go to her choir meeting
at Fulneck and many time as she returnd home with the Sisters
she us'd to say O I wish I coud always feel as I do on those days
I always think that I will give every thing to our Savr but 
yet my lightmindedness comes again but yet for all that 
I know I am our Saviours and he will accept me just so as
I am the 10th of March being Congregation day in Fulneck
she with the rest of the Sisters went to the same and got such
an impression there from that she never lost and when it
was given out that the Brn and Sisrs would soon recive the Acts of the 
Son of Man she not have a right undersanding what was said
she understood that our Saviour was soon to come which put 
her in such uncommon joy that she hadly knew how to contain 


her self and simply told her thoughts to the Sisters and how she
felt about it soon after she begun to complain that she felt
such but did not think that her dessolution was so near but
she grew worse and worse that we at last coud think no other
ways then that our Savr woud soon take her to him self her
disorder began to grow very strong on her tho' as long as she
was able she she did not keep her bed she was often heard
speaking when alone with our Saviour and tho' she her
self did not think that he woud soon take her to himself
yet she was heard some time saying to him thy will be done
she at last began to grow very weak but to the very last 
she never kept her bed the day before her desolution it was
perceptable that she woud not continue long the Sister that
waited on her ask'd her if she felt our Saviour near her
and if she did not think that she soon go to him to which
she answerd that she desird him often to let her feel his 
nearness and that if it pleasd him to take her to him self
that he woud not delay the time too long the Morning after 
she desird that her Labrous might be fetch'd and as the Sister
who waited on her was going to call one of the Sisters to her
she heard her speak to our Saviour but coud not tell any thing
she said when she came to her she percievd she was departing
and to our great suprise she got her last kiss and thus was 
her joy now compleated in him whom she so desird having liv'd
in this dying life 15 years 99 Weeks
