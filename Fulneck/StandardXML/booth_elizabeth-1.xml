					<lb />I was Born in the town of Mirfield in Yorkshir in the year 1735
					<lb />on the 29 of Sept, my parents belonging the Church of Ingland In my
					<lb />young years, begun to be Consarned about My Salvation &amp; was affraid
					<lb />of doing of saying any thing which would Displeas God for fear I Might
					<lb />not be saved one Night when I was about 6 years old I dreamt our
					<lb />Sav came into the Room were I was, as soon at I saw him got up &amp; ran
					<lb />to him &amp; pray&apos;d him to Bless me which he did &amp; I thought he Showd
					<lb />me a well in the side of the room In the which he said I Should be
					<lb />dipped of then I should be his it had such an Imprection on me
					<lb />that I never forgot it when the Brethen came to preach at foxwood
					<lb />I went with my Mother &amp; got a Love for them In some time after
					<lb />Bro Helt came to have the Care of the Children so he told us as Many
					<lb />us had a mind to be our Saviours Should wright a few lines to him
					<lb />which I did also his Meetings was peculery Blest to my heart &amp;
					<lb />When he told us of our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>s</hi> becoming Man and that he he was
					<lb />crusyfyed of had Recved So many wounds for as to perchase our Salvation
					<lb />I was very much lade hold on &amp; I wept Many times, as I grew older I
					<lb />??? to to be put in here
					<lb />felt my Corruption more &amp; more which made me very heavy and
					<lb />glomy I thought Shurly there is not one that is So Spoiled &amp; So
					<lb />full of evel as I am, but the Convictions which felt I never went
					<lb />In no Gross sins yet I felt a love for Sin &amp; begun a self working
					<lb />a striving to become better, the More I Strove against it the
					<lb />worse I grew I often took Lonely walks were I might have my thoughts
					<lb />to myself &amp; allso pour out my Sighs to the Lord, evry thing I saw
					<lb />Increased my sorow they looked So happy &amp; evry thing answered
					<lb />the end for what they was formed for but as for me I lothed
					<lb />myself feeling Nought but Sin, I frequeuted the Meetings
					<lb />very Constant, I felt as if I was going to be juged for evry Word
					<lb />As the Bro spoke I tried my own Heart by it to feell if I
					<lb />Could get any hopes that our Sav would have Mercy on such a
					<lb />Rech as I am, when the Sisters came to Visit me Sis Lesel and
					<lb />Eunes Brook being Sisters that had a pecular Confidence to I
					<lb />felt a grate freedom to tell them my whole Heart as well as ever
					<lb />I Could in hopes that they Could Gess weather I should come thro or no
					<lb />they allways Comforted me &amp; told me it was a Grace that our Sav
					<lb />Let me feell what I was by nature &amp; allso that it was just such that
					<lb />our Sav came to save, but I being of a reasoning turn it seemed
					<lb />to be made to very esey &amp; except I felt our Savs Nearness so clear as
					<lb />&amp; I allmost saw him I dare not beleve &amp; so Long as I have not this
					<lb />Grace I will not have no other Comfort that is to be assured of the
					<lb />forgivness of all my Sins, so I went on fo some time struggling

					<lb />strugling with my Lods as a silly child for if I had a more Simple Heart
					<lb />I know I Might have found rest sooner, but my dear Sav whose Care
					<lb />I have been Shure of from a littell Child did not for all my unbeleve
					<lb />&amp; hardness of Heart did not leave his poor Child but followed me with
					<lb />Unweared patience tell he Could his ame fullfill so I went on till
					<lb />my 17 year when I begun to be tired of all my own attempts &amp; to See
					<lb />clearly I Could do Nothing of myself, so I thought if I perish it shall
					<lb />be at My Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>s</hi> feet, but one day when I was praying by myself I broke
					<lb />out in these words I am a Sinner this I know all in me deserving wo
					<lb />but Sence thou has dyed for me my Lamb I pray thee take me as I
					<lb />am, I had no Sooner giving myself into the Hands of my Sav, to live
					<lb />but my dearist Bridgroom manifested himself so clear before my
					<lb />Heart &amp; eys with all his wounds that I was quite overcome with his
					<lb />Beauty I felt that he had forgave me all my Sins &amp; the Lods I had
					<lb />Carried was quite gorn O how I felt I shall never forget my Heart
					<lb />was so Captivated with my Bloody Freind that he was become my
					<lb />Cheff Object O I cannot express the part what peace &amp; life my poor
					<lb />heart Injoyed for I can say with truth when in his Blood I saw him
					<lb />Swim a small drop I did get which glued me to him, him to me the
					<lb />First time that we meet, I began to think I Could like very Much
					<lb />to be in the Congregation tho, I felt myself very unworthy of that grace
					<lb />but I spoke with our Sav about it often, but leaving it at the Same time
					<lb />to his will for I was affrade of myself not answering the end, I never
					<lb />told my Cosarn to my Labours for I thought if our Saviour thinks
					<lb />good I Shall be Reced he will put it into the Bre &amp; Sis, hearts when it
					<lb />is the wright time, when I came to Fulneck my Labour told me I might
					<lb />wright to the Congrea, which was very welcome to me so I did &amp; Brought it to
					<lb />my labour, and in the year 1752 on the 13 of Nov I had the Grace to be
					<lb />Rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ed</hi> into the dear Cong, of which I felt myself very unworthy of but
					<lb />I gave myself up to our dear Sav &amp; wished to be a joy to him &amp; to his pepel
					<lb />soon after I had the unexpected news that I had leave to come in the Choir
					<lb />House which Suprised me; I allways had a pecular mind to be in the Choir
					<lb />house or Econemy but I thought it to grate a Grace for poor me, as soon as
					<lb />my parents Could get my things ready I came which was on the 3 of Feb
					<lb />1753 when I got my long wished for Desire granted to live in the Choir
					<lb />House were I lived a grate Girl tell the Mounth of Aug<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> the Singell
					<lb />Sisters fest being put of tell then on account of our dear Annajonah
					<lb />&amp; Jonas coming &amp; on the 15 of Augstt I was Rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ed</hi> into the Sisters Choir I felt
					<lb />a littell pain at parting with my Choir for had injoyed many Blessings
				
			</p>

					<lb />Blessing from our Saviour in it but as it was his will I devoted myself to
					<lb />by dearist Bridegroom &amp; wished to become a true virgin Both in
					<lb />Soul &amp; Body to be intirely to his Heart in all things, in the year 1753
					<lb />on Sep ye 9 I had the Grace to injoy for the First time the holy Screament
					<lb />for which I was quite bowed down feeling myself so unwothry of such Grace which
					<lb />I injoyed at that time when I was prevaded with his dear Corps &amp; Blood thro
					<lb />&amp; thro, in the year 1754 our dear papar &amp; Mammar pade us a Viset and we 
					<lb />had for the First time here a Choir Scrament &amp; foot washing the impretion of
					<lb />which I shall never forget it was as if our Sav &amp; me was quite alone for some
					<lb />time, in a wile after our dear Sav let me see More of myself that I had
					<lb />a grate deal in me that wanted to be dealing &amp; Sanktifyed thro our Saviours
					<lb />Grace My Disopition being of such a sort that when I See any thing I thought
					<lb />not right I was so hasty in speaking which Brought me often into Uneseyness
					<lb />but our Best Friend allways brought me soon to the Sinner point &amp; let me
					<lb />feell what a poor Child I was and would not let me be Sattifyed if I had Severd
					<lb />from him in any thing till I felt his Forgiveness, in May 1761 I  was made
					<lb />use of Amongst the Girls for which I felt myself very unfetlt but it proved
					<lb />a Blessed Scoul for my own Heart I got to see many things in myself that
					<lb />I was Egrant of and made me Cleave Closer to our dearist Sav for his daly
					<lb />instruction &amp; sweet nearness to bring me thro in all things According to his
					<lb />Heart, and I Can never be thankfull enofe for all the Grace &amp; Blessing
					<lb />which I poor Child have injoyed in my Choir the Congreation and 
					<lb />for which I will kiss his dear feet when I come to him and feell often to ???
					<lb />in my self of my ?? ?? ???
					<lb />myself quite Chearfull &amp; Sattifyed there being nothing between my
					<lb />I am a ??? lot loving nothing?
					<lb />Dearist Bridegroom and me, I am now in the Sick Room waiting for
					<lb />the last kiss When he go home I long to see will take me to himself
					<lb />I have noting to bring

					<lb />before him, but his blodig raistifuls I cannot but bless for
