      <p> from a child She was never without Convictions, and as soon y<sup>e</sup><br></br>Brethren came to <a href="#mlpla000035.html">Duckenfield</a>, She was one y<sup>e</sup>
         						&amp; first Children wich was <br></br> takes under y<sup>e</sup>B<sup>rns</sup> care, y<sup>e</sup>tenderLongingof her heart is become truly acquaintd <br></br> with our Saviour, <sup>and</sup> to know
         						for her own individual; her Grace of Election in y<sup>e</sup><br></br> Wounds of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>, was plainly felt and seen in all his Actions; She Us'd <br></br> often to go alone by her Self, in to <sup>the</sup> fields, and when she Could get in to a <br></br> privet place prostrated her self on y<sup>e</sup> ground, before our Saviour, beging him <br></br> for his Death and Bloods Sake, to bestow upon her, that happiness, and <br></br> full
         						pardon in his Wounds, which she felt, as belived was to be attain'd <br></br> to; even wile in this Body, in this sittuation She went on, till she had obtain'd
         <br></br> what her
         							heart wanted; of this blest course of Grace, which our Saviour<br></br> begun with her wile a Child; She Us'd afterwards to relate with <br></br>plesuer; and it always came from her with such a tender felling, that <br></br> Who ever heard her speak thereof Could
         						not but be Sencably back'd, <br></br> In y<sup>e</sup><em>Year 1744</em> She left her Parents, and lived with her three <br></br> Brothers and two Sisters, Who on account of their Mother, being <br></br> at
         						that time of a different way of thinking from them, had taken a <br></br> house them Selves; in order to follow their Course with y<sup>e</sup> Brethren <br></br>
         						more to their own Satisfaction, she lived thus about half a year <br></br> and then she with her two Sister, and a few more, made y<sup>e</sup> begining <br></br> of a little Oeconomy, which lasted about a year and half, when on some <br></br> Ocations, it was
         						thought fit for that House-keeping to be broke up, <br></br> And such had <sup>it</sup> propos'd to them, to go to their homes again, <br></br> This proved a great grife, to our depated Sister, and She with her Christ <br></br> Sister Resolve'd not to go back to their parents, but to live together
         						<br></br> till our Saviour Should see fit to make out some way for them, which <br></br> Accordingly happen'd, that very year, When <a href=".html">Brother</a>, and <a href="#mlper000117.html">Sister <br></br> Hackenwelter</a> came thither, Who Approved him

         						Child in all <br></br> this time, our Saviour carried on <sup>his</sup> Worke of Gracein her heart, in a manner <br></br> not to be discribed, but which at y<sup>e</sup> same time was very Decernable to all
