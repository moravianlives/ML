      <h2>Christian Bell</h2>
      <p><em>February 1772 <br></br></em><a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000564.html">Christian Bell</a> was born in <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> <em>Dec<sup>r</sup> 7<sup>th</sup>  <br></br> 1742</em> and came as a little Boy into the Children's <br></br> Oeconomy, he
         						was a very lovely Child, beloved by all <br></br> about him. When he arrived to his Boys Age, he <br></br> was put apprentice to our dear late B<sup>r</sup><a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000544.html">Charlesworth</a> in <br></br> the Merchant Business, during which time he <br></br> behaved himself as an orderly &amp; faithful
         						Apprentice, <br></br> and gave full Satisfaction to B<sup>r</sup><a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000544.html">Charlesworth</a> &amp; others <br></br> about him. It was evident that
         						there was a Work <br></br> of Grace in his Heart, &amp; those who were acquainted <br></br> with him were in Hopes that he would not only prosper <br></br> &amp; become a happyBrother, but that he would also be <br></br> useful in our Sav<sup>rs</sup> kingdom,
         						In these Years he was <br></br>very openhearted &amp; seemed to have no other Concern than <br></br> to be formed by our Sav<sup>r</sup> quite according to his Mind &amp; <br></br> to live for His alone in the World.</p>
      <p>He was received into the Cong<sup>n</sup><em>April 16<sup>th</sup> 1754</em> &amp; on <br></br><em>August 29<sup>th</sup> 1762</em>he was rec'd into the Single B<sup>rns</sup> Choir<br></br><em>March 27<sup>th</sup> 1766</em> he was admitted to the holy Com- <br></br>
         							munion, but which had not the wished for Effect. Soon <br></br>after he went to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> where the Snares laid for
         						him <br></br> caught a surprizing Hold of him &amp; a love to the World </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> took place in him, so that his Soul rec'd a Hurt at this <br></br> Time which was never rightly cured again till a little <br></br> while before his
         						Departure.</p>
      <p> After he set up Business for himself, it obliged him <br></br>to make some Journeys to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, where Temptations<br></br> were renewed, to draw him altogether into the World, and <br></br> altho' the Staff of Corruption &amp; strong tendencies thereto <br></br> lay in him, yet he felt such Strong
         						Convictions, that he <br></br> never could come to a Resolution to go into the World; <br></br> yet this divided Heart &amp; continual Struggle
         						betwixt our <br></br>Sav<sup>r</sup> &amp; the World caused him a heavy &amp; truly
         							unhappy Life <br></br> that one could not see and speak with him without being <br></br> moved with compassion. At Times he was much concern'd<br></br> about his unhappy State of Heart &amp; wished our Sav<sup>r</sup><br></br> might attain his Aim with him; he also was some times <br></br> very sensibly Struck with the strong proofs he had of our <br></br>Sav<sup>rs</sup> Faithfulness to him &amp; by seeing how He kept his Hand <br></br> over Him. This had the effect upon him
         						that he once in <br></br> a particular Manner pray'd our Sav<sup>r</sup> if He saw no other <br></br> way of obtaining his Aim
         						with him to do it by giving him <br></br> a sickly Habit of Body, <sup>or taking him to himself</sup> rather than suffer him to go into
         							<br></br> the World, &amp; he has often considered our Sv<sup>rs</sup> Dealings with <br></br> him as an Answer to
         						this Prayer. <em>About a half a Year ago</em>, as he was going to <a href="#mlpla000050.html">Leeds</a> &amp; had still thoughts of pursuing a Worldly Scheme, tho' with much uneasiness of Mind &amp;
         						Having pray'd as above, he stop'd &amp; looked back for his Company when he got
         a Vomiting of blood, which was the beginning of his last Sickness.</p>
      <p> About <em>2 months ago</em> it was observed that his tender</p>
      <p> and weakly Constitution turned into a Consumption &amp; <br></br> he declined very fast. He was frequently visited by <br></br> many B<sup>rn</sup>, for he was generally beloved, &amp; when it drew <br></br> nearer his End that he
         						himself begun to think, he <br></br> would soon go home, he spoke with great concern, to <br></br> Some of the Labourers whom he had
         						most Confidence<br></br> in &amp; had been best acquainted with, and Lamented<br></br> that he had spend much of his Time so poorly with Rea- <br></br> soning, Reading unprofitable Books, neglecting the <br></br> Meetings &amp; other privileges of the
         							Congregation, he <br></br> also said that he never had experienced the true Grace<br></br> in the Blood &amp; Merits of Christ <sup>as a poor</sup><del>our Saviour</del> Sinner.</p>
      <p>This brought him into such Distress that he thought<br></br> he would be lost. Two Nights before his Departure, <br></br><sup>and being</sup><del>when he was</del> yet pretty strong, he wept &amp; prayed all <br></br> the Night thro' <sup>and got</sup><del>when he</del> also <del>got</del>Comfort from our <br></br> Sav<sup>r</sup>. From that Time his Fear was gone &amp; he longed<br></br> to go to our Sav<sup>r</sup>. which was on the <em>6<sup>th</sup> of Feb<sup>r</sup>.</em>  , the same <br></br> Evening he sat up a long while &amp; conversed with 2 B<sup>rn</sup><br></br> in a bandlike way in the heartiest &amp; very agreeable <br></br> Manner. He also kept a very openhearted Band with <br></br> a Labourer 2 days before. He himself thought <br></br> he should continue about 3 weeks longer, but the </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> Night betwixt the<em> 6<sup>th</sup></em> &amp; <em>7<sup>th</sup> of Fcbruary</em>, he
         						all at <br></br> once began to hasten, &amp; when his Choir Labourer <br></br> came to him at 5 in the Morning he asked him, if <br></br> he had got full forgiveness from our Sav<sup>r</sup>, &amp; if he <br></br> now was longing to go
         						to Him, both he answered in <br></br> the Affirmive. A few Minutes after it was <br></br> observed that the happy moment approached. He <br></br> was blessed &amp; turned pale during the Verse: When in <br></br> the Armes of Jesus etc. accompanied with a
         								sweet <br></br> feeling of Grace in the 30 Year of his Age. </p>PAGE BREAK</body>
