    <h2>George Wood</h2>
    <p> Departed <em>Feb 3, 1761</em> Personalia of the single B<sup>r</sup> <a href="#mlper000543.html">George Wood</a>, who in his sick room <br /> left the following Acc<sup>t </sup>of himself. </p>
    <p>I was born at <a href="#mlpla000089.html">Holbeck in the Parish of Leeds</a><em>August 25<sup>th</sup> 1735</em>. <br /> My Father was a native of <a href="#mlpla000114.html">Ireland</a> &amp;
      my Mother a <a href="#mlpla000084.html">Yorkshire</a> Woman. <br /> When I was about 2 years old my Father left my Mother to Care <br /> for herself &amp; Children &amp; went into <a
        href="#mlpla000114.html">Ireland</a>. My Mother brought <br /> me up as well as she could, but on Account of Poverly was not <br /> able to give me any Schooling, the Loss of which I have
      experienced <br /> the most since I come amongst the B<sup>rn</sup> ; for as I had not learn'd to <br /> read, I was deprived of that Opportunity which my B<sup>rn</sup> have, of <br />
      entertaining themselves, with reading something agreeable about <br /> our Sav<sup>r</sup>, in their sabbatic Hours: But this Loss has been suffic <br /> ciently restored by our
      Sav<sup>r</sup> in granting me his precious <br /> Nearness, whenever I wept for him! </p>
    <p> In my Youngest Years, I was a Child of a quiet Disposition, <br /> and liked best to be alone because when I happened to come into <br /> the Company of other Children, something generally
      occurred <br /> about which my Mind was uneasy afterwards, I therefore kept <br /> chiefly <sup>by</sup> to myself &amp; often took a Walk alone, feeling my Mind <br />most easy and chearful in
      this Course. </p>
    <p> In my <em>12<sup>th</sup> Year</em>, I was put apprentice to my <a href=".html">Uncle Stancliff</a><br /> who was then amongst the B<sup>rn</sup>, to be a Clothier &amp; the first Sunday
      <br /> he took me with him to <a href=".html">Grace Hall</a>, on which Day I felt something <br /> powerful in my Heart from our Sav<sup>r</sup> ; What I heard &amp; felt had such an Effect that
      I could not miss one Meeting afterwards <br /> to which I was allowed the Priviledge of going. I soon got acquainted with dear <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Held</a>, who gave me Leave to go to
      all the <br />Childrens Meetings, Bands &amp; Classes, which proved a real Blessing<br />to my Heart. "When I was about <em>14 Years old</em>I was rec<sup>d </sup> amongst <br /> the great Boys
      by <a href="#mlper000544.html">B<sup>r</sup>  Charlesworth</a> from which Time I attended <br /> the Boys Meetings diligently &amp; with Pleasure not obtaining any <br /> Thing particular in
      Mind or Body to what I had done in my <br /> Childrens Years, but felt our Sav<sup>r</sup> near my Heart, &amp; was well <br /> in the Meetings of the Boys; yet during all this time tho' I felt
      <br /> very well, I had not a real &amp; solid Connexion &amp; Conversation <br /> with our Sav<sup>r</sup> as a Sinner, which afterwards was made clear to me. <br /></p>
    <p> In my <em>18<sup>th</sup> Year</em> I begun to perceive my natural Depravity and </p>

    <p> Corruption pretty strongly, promting me to things which I know very <br /> well were against
      the Mind, <del>of</del> &amp; Heart of our Sav<sup>r</sup>, but has <sup>not</sup> sufficient <br /> acquaintance with Him &amp; Foundation in my own Heart to make the <br /> right Use of him in
      these new Circumstances, &amp; was therefore brought <br /> into Darkness &amp; great Perplexity of Mind, so that I was sometimes <br />very dubious how it would at last End with me, yet
        <del>the</del>in the <br /> bottom of my Heart I had a real desire to be helped into a happy<br /> clear Track but my greatest Misfortune was a false shame, which <br /> caused me to conceal
        <del>the</del> my true Condition &amp; the Cause of my Differences <br /> from my labourers, but being frequently visited <del>by</del> at that time <br /> by B<sup>r</sup> <a
        href="#mlper000700.html">Renatus</a>, he perceived I was not so clear &amp; lively as usual &amp; <br /> wanted to know the cause, but which I avoided telling, till I could <br /> hold out no
      longer, being compelled by the great Miseryof my Heart<br /> to disclose every thing wherewith I was bound &amp; entangled, &amp; which <br /> indeed proved very happy for me in its
      Consequences. I then could <br /> &amp; did speak with our Sav<sup>r</sup> in a sinnerlike, confident Manner, &amp; often <br /> times fell on my Face before <sup>him</sup> &amp; wept bitterly,
      till He melted my<br />Heart with his Nearness &amp; rich Forgiveness, &amp; cheared me with his <br /> friendly look. I then resolved to devote my Soul &amp; Body just as <br /> it was to him,
      &amp; to speak quite openheartedly with my Labourers <br /> about all my Circumstances for I felt the sweets of it, &amp; since I <br /> made that Resolution it has been my constant practice to
      my <br />surprisingease &amp; Blessing. From this time, I have had a happy Con: <br /> nexion with our Sav<sup>r</sup>, I went every Night into the Fields after I <br /> had done work to speak
      with the Friend of my Soul, whom incom <br /> parable Nearness &amp; presence always met me, so that my Eyes &amp; Heart <br /> were often overflowing with gratitude, on Account of what he had
      <br /> done for &amp; manifested to me. My concern about the Preservation <br /> of my Soul &amp; body was often the Subject of my Conversation with Him <br /> &amp; therefore I pray'd him with
      Tears to make a Way for me to the <a href=".html">Choir House</a><br /> for I felt no place else in all the world could satisfy me. Some Weeks, <br /> after I was loose of my Apprenticeship, I
      had the Joyfull<br /> News brought me that our Sav<sup>r</sup>had given me Leave to come &amp; live <br /> in the <a href=".html">Choir House</a> which Grace I accepted of with thousand
      thanks<br /> to my dear Sav<sup>r</sup>, who thus graciously heard &amp; granted my Request <br /> &amp; soon after I came with Joy &amp; gratitudeof heart into my beloved </p>
    <p><a href=".html">Choir house</a> in my <em>20<sup>th</sup> year July the 8<sup>th</sup> 1756</em>, and <em>Nov<sup>r</sup>: the 22<sup>d</sup></em> the <br /> same year had the Grace to be
        rec'<sup>d</sup> into the Cong<sup>n</sup> to my inexpressible <br /> Joy, and went the first Fine to the holy Communion with my clear Single <br /> B<sup>rn</sup> at a Choir Communion
        <em>June 11<sup>th</sup> 1757</em> whereby my highest Wish<br /> next to that of seeing &amp; embracing him bodily was granted me, &amp; <br /> which I shall never forgot. </p>
    <p><em>About Easter in the Year 1759</em> a <del>gathered</del>Humour <del>came</del><sup>fell</sup> into <br /> one of my Feet &amp; broke out in a running Ulcer whereby I was <br /> incapable of
      earning my bread for a long Time. I made Use of <br /> many things &amp; also by Advice went to the how, not without long <br />Effect, tho' a real Care was not wrought by any thing I tried
      or<br /> did for tho it healed one quarter it broke out the next &amp; now a Con <br /> sumption <del>came</del><sup>added</sup> thereto, so that I have a near Prospect of soon <br />kissing the

    <p>So far his own account.</p>
    <p> To which we will only add, that his course amongst us from <br /> first to last has been as a <sup>youth</sup> of <a href=".html">God</a>, solid, steady &amp; annointed. <br /> and his Heart
      past has <del>has</del> lived in a tender uninterrupted connexion <br /> with the Man of Sorrows, so that it was always a pleasure to keep Band <br /> with him. We kept his Hearts object
      constantly in View &amp; suffered <br /> nothing to disturb him in the Enjoyment thereof, so that we have <br /> had no Grief, but always Joy over him, &amp; some Years <sup>since</sup> when the
        <br /><sup>situation of</sup><del>it looked precarious with</del> many of our young Single B<sup>rn</sup> <sup>seemed very precarious</sup> he was <br /> not in the least disturbed thereby in
      his happy Track, but cleaved <br /> the more closely to our Sav<sup>r</sup> &amp; was heartilyglad of &amp; thankful<br /> for his election. </p>
    <p><del>After the above mentioned</del><sup>His</sup>Sickness would not <sup>From the time that</sup> permit him to weave <br /><del>work</del> any longer<del>at</del> he busied himself with such
      little <br /> Matters as he could do in the House &amp; which he did with Faithfulness <br /> &amp; Pleasure as long as he could, &amp; till he betook himself entering <br /> to the <a
        href=".html">Sick Room</a>. Here he enjoyd a perfect Sabbath in the Nearness <br /> of his bleeding Sav<sup>r</sup>. It was a Pleasure to visit him &amp; speak with <br /> him abt. our
        Sav<sup>r</sup>.. He never liked to hear any thing about his reco- <br /> very but wish'd<sup>that</sup> his happy Hour <sup>might soon</sup> strike. He was patient in his Sickness <br /> to
      Admonition for said he, our Savr's Nearness makes my Sickness tolerable &amp; Happy. </p>

    <p> &amp; <sup>was</sup>thankful to his Brn, as also to to his Sick Waiters for every Thing he
      <br />enjoyed. <del>At</del> the last <sup>time he was spoken with</sup><del>Speaking</del> before the Communion he said I think <br /> this will be the last Time I <sup>shall</sup>enjoy His
      Corpse Blood here &amp; when <br /> it was brought to him he enjoyd it with great Devotion &amp; a particular <br />aweful Feeling attended it. </p>
    <p> The 2 last times his Class was kept he decided it might be in his <br /><a href=".html">Sick Room</a>, which was granted. he told his Class B<sup>rn</sup> that his longing<br /> to be with our
        Sav<sup>r</sup> was the only Concern he now had and entreated <br /> them to beg our Sav<sup>r</sup> to hear him soon. <em>Feb 2<sup>d</sup></em> he was so very <br /> weak that we expected
      him soon to go Home. His Heart's Situation and <br />Longing to go home was charming and pretty: Love verses were sung <br /> for him &amp; tho he could speak no more yet he gave signs with a
      <br />most lovely childlike Aspect &amp; said at the end of every Verse, moor. <br /><em>Feb the 3<sup>d</sup></em> betwixt 3 &amp; 4 in the Morning he called to his Sick Waiter<br /> &amp;
      wanted to get up. Upon being ask'd Why? he answered, "I am not <br /> yet at Home, I want to go home to our Sav<sup>r</sup>." He was told that <br /> our Sav<sup>r</sup> would soon come &amp;
      take him to himself which he <br /> was <sup>much</sup> pleased to be assured of, &amp; thus he continued quite unfit <br /> to his last Moment when about 8 o'Clock his Friend beckon'd <br /> to
      him, &amp; he grew pale in Arms &amp; Legs with the Blessing<br /> of his Choir during the singing the Word "And now his <br /> Mouth expiring on thy dear Breast recline &amp;c and with <br />
      these fine Tents, The Sparrow hath found an House, and <br /> the Swallow a Nest. lit: Tent. With my Spirit within me <br /> I seek thee early. My Saviour, Ah! was I with Thee.<br /> The Feeling
      attending his Separture was inexpressible, &amp; <br /> caused the Eyes of the B<sup>rn </sup> presant to overflow, our Sav<sup>r</sup><br /> was indeed there tho our Eyes could not see Him yet
      the <br /> Feeling testified it sufficiently. </p></body>
