							The Life of the Widow<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Skelton
							who departed at Fulneck June 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1773
							He has left us the following in Writing; I was born in
							the Year 1703 in Lightlif in the Parish of Hallifax,
							my Father &amp; Mother belonged to the Church of England. My
							Father died, when I was but a very little Boy, my Mother
							brought me as till I was 8 Years old as carefully as she
							could, afterwards I was put Prentice to a Norwich
							Carrier, where I learned to be very wicked, but yet I had oft
							Convictions, that I lived in quite a wrong Way, yet that
							left me again. In my 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I married. When M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham
							began to preach about in <del>the Country</del> Yorkshire, it came in
							my Mind to go to hear him; but the first Time I <del>got</del> received
							no Blessing from it. The next Night he was to preach at
							Smithhouse, <del>when</del>
								<add place="above">but</add> I had no thought of going till towards
							Night, when I had a long Struggle whether I should go or not,
							but at last I resolved to go, whatever might come out of it,
							and that Night our Savr got fast Hold of my Heart, so that
							I could after that have gone with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham thro&apos; the 
							World; but yet I was at a Loss what would become of me
							for I was in such a ruin&apos;d State, &amp; never acquainted M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Ingham that I was so miserable. I went constantly to the 
							Preaching, &amp; strove to be as stood as ever I could, <add place="above">in order to find Peace for my Heart,</add> but all in 
							vain, till about a Year after, when I got some Comfort;
							yet for all that I thought I was not sure of being happy. I 
							went to Speak with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham about going to the Sacrament
							in the Church of Engl<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>, then he inquired how it was with me
							&amp; I told him my whole Mind, but he told me, it was not his Way
							to advice People to go to the Sacrament, left it however to me
							to do as I felt it in my Heatr so I went &amp; received a 
							Blessing thereby. When the Society was first begun <add place="above">1741</add> I was
							received into it. Then the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> came to Smithhouse &amp; I

							went to hear them constantly, &amp; one Night when the Meeting
							was over B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horne took me into his Room &amp; ask&apos;d me how it
							was with me &amp; I told him my whole Mind, &amp; he spoke very
							friendly with me, &amp; told me, that I might go to all the Meetings
							whence I had an Opportunity, of which I was very glad
							One lvening I went to a meeting at Smith house, &amp; <del>going</del> as
							I was going home quite by myself, I felt something speaking
							to me at my Heart. Thy sins are forgiven thee &amp; ever since
							I have been very happy. <add place="above">March 29</add> 1746 my Wife went home, &amp;
							left me with 7 Child<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, 5 Sons &amp; 2 Daughters, &amp; 1 Daughter was
							gone before her. I had a Desire to be rec&apos;<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
							&amp; Novr 13 1750 I was received, which was a great Blessing to
							my Heart. June 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>
								<add place="above">1751</add> I rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> the Sacrament with the Brn the 
							first Time, which was such a Blessing to me, as I cannot
							express with Words. So I have lived in the Nearness of our
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ever since. Thus far his own Words.

							Nov 27 1758 he moved to Fulneck, where he spent his Time
							in a Simple, childlike Manner, enjoying the Love &amp; Peace of
							God &amp; was beloved by his B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>. He esteemed his Lot highly, to have
							the Favour to live with a People of God taking simply every
							Thing that occurred from the Hand of his dr Lord <del>with to</del>
								<add place="above">with</add> whom
							<del>he Heart</del> had a true Connexion. It was his great Concern
							&amp; his constant Prayer to our Lord, that his Children might all
							obtain the same Grace &amp; that those, who were connected with 
							the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> might truly make a good use of <add place="above">&amp;</add> prosper before our 
							Lord; And this his Desire our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> granted him in so far that
							he saw the greatest Number of them connected with the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
							for which he was very thankful &amp; praised his Lord. Some
							months ago his Strength began to fail, &amp; he thought immediately that his stay here would no more be long. Our Savr began
							to take him into his School &amp; to shew him, wherein he was 
							<del>particularly</del>
								<add place="above">still</add> deficient.
							<!-- These lines are inserted from left margin -->
							he said: Tho&apos; he had
							spent many years in the
							Congn &amp; lived in the Enjoy
							ment of the Love of God,
							yet he found it a trying
							Time for him &amp; a School 
							for his Heart
							<!-- end insert -->
							<del>For</del> some time <add place="above">ago</add> something against
							one of his B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, with whom he lived, had crept into his Mind
							it cost him something to see it in the true Light; but our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> melted his Heart &amp; gave
							him Grace to embrace the B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> with many Tears of Love to the no small joy of those present.
							From that Time the Peace of his Heart &amp;

							him to acknowledge it &amp; give it up, yet selfrighteousness
							had so much Power, that he thought he could never forgive it.
							His Labourer had a lovely Bond with him upon that head, which
							made him so uneasy, that he could not sleep the whole Night
							when some of his sons saw him the next day, a strange Work
							was perceived in his Mind &amp; they were truly frighten&apos;d at the 
							Expressions he uttered upon that Occasion, &amp; could not help shed
							ding Tears. But it was amazing to see, how our Savr chang&apos;d
							his mind in an instant he called immediately for the Brother

							pressed him to his Heart, which caused such in Emotion in
							the Beholders, that they wept for joy, <del>as</del> hardly being able to
							believe what they saw with their Eyes. From that time such an
							Alteration was observed in him, as if he had <del>never</del>
								<add place="above">not</add> been the 
							same Man. He loved the above Br with an unfeign&apos;d Love &amp; could
							not bear, that any spoke a hard Word to him.

							<!--end strikethrough -->
							His Peace of Heart
							&amp; his joy in the Lord was visible in his Countenance. He spoke
							solidly with some of his Children, partly <del>uttering</del> telling them
							where they were in the wrong &amp; partly fearing, how it would go 
							with one of them after his Departure. Once at being asked
							by his Labourer how he did, he said: I have nothing to do but to re
							joice in our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; to enjoy Him. He is very near to my Heart
							whereby the Tears ran down. One Night our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> manifested
							his Love to his Heart in such a rich treasure, that he firmly
							believed he should now be called home, &amp; therefore caused his
							Labourer to be called to when be could not express sufficiently
							what our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had given him to enjoy But his Hour was not
							so near as he expected. His sickness <del>&amp; pain</del>
								<del><add place="above">was very painful</add></del> increased, which
							<del>he bore with Patience</del> &amp; <add place="above">he</add> had <add place="above">still</add> a great Deal to suffer, which made
							him oft call upon the Lord soon to come &amp; take him to himself.
							His Heart remain&apos;d during all that Time cleaving to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
