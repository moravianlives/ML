            <lb/>Our late S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Mary Armstrong
            <lb/>was born in Ireland Jan. 18 / 93
            <lb/>&amp; was taken, when a child of 8 or 9 years
            <lb/>of age, to our Ladies' Boarding School
            <lb/>at Gracehill, then under the superinten
            <lb/>dance of our S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Montgomery, at pres<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi>
            <lb/>residing here. While at school she showed
            <lb/>great excellent abilities &amp; made great progress in
            <lb/>learning. In 1810 she went with B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r. </hi>
            <lb/>Montgomery to Okbrook, where
            <lb/>she lived in the Sisters house 1 year. She
            <lb/>then accepted an appointment as Teacher
            <lb/>in our Ladies' Boarding School at Bed
            <lb/>ford &amp; remained in that situation 10
            <lb/>yrs. In 1821 she went to Gracehill as
            <lb/>Governess of the Ladies School there; 
            <lb/>from thence, in 2 or 3 years to Wyke, in
            <lb/>the same capacity. She then lived a 
            <lb/>short time in a gentleman's family
            <lb/>in Leciestershire; &amp;, after spending
            <lb/>a few months with her much esteem
            <lb/>ed friends B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi> Montgomery in at
            <lb/>Okbrook, entered upon the office of first
            <lb/>Teacher in our Girls' Boarding school
            <lb/>here &amp; held that which situation she held till
            <lb/>midsummer last year. About
            <lb/>that time her health began to fail; &amp;
            <lb/>in the course of last summer she gra
            <lb/>dually grew worse her complaint or
            <lb/>rather complication of diseases complaints baffling
            <lb/>all medical skill. In Sept<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> last 
            <lb/>she went first to Kirkstall, then to
            <lb/>Harrogate, to try the effect of change of
            <lb/>air; but the illness her diseases gained ground
            </p>

            <p>
            <lb/>&amp; she returned much weaker than she went
            <lb/>in Oct towards the end of October. She
            <lb/>now grew rapidly worse, &amp; her sufferings
            <lb/>were often severe. At length on Tuesday
            <lb/>morning last, about 8 o'clock a.m. it
            <lb/>pleased the Lord to put a period ot her 
            <lb/>trials &amp; afflictions &amp; she fell gently
            <lb/>&amp; happily asleep in Jesus at the age
            <lb/>of 55 years &amp; 11 mo<hi rend="superscript:true;">s.</hi>
            <lb/>The good seed which was sown in 
            <lb/>was later her heart at that time 
            <lb/>hardly sprang up &amp; gave good fruit through
            <lb/>out her life. (The ministry of the
            <lb/>word, the means of grace public &amp; 
            <lb/>private &amp; the faithful &amp; judicious
            <lb/>training of her much revered Gov
            <lb/>verness, while she was at school in
            <lb/>Gracehill were much greatly blessed to
            <lb/>our late Sister's soul &amp; she had
            <lb/>her peculiarities; but she was, beyond
            <lb/>all doubts, a true, conscientious &amp;
            <lb/>faithful ????. She read the scrip
            <lb/>tures diligently &amp; regularly, &amp; not
            <lb/>only read, but studied them, 
            <lb/>placing a high value for on them 
            <lb/>delighting to search
            <lb/>it them. Her views of saving truth
            <lb/>were very clear &amp; her convictions deep
            <lb/>&amp; decided; &amp; she was rather fond of
            <lb/>discussing scriptural subjects.
            <lb/>She was faithful in self-examina
            <lb/>tion &amp; in prayer. In the important 
            <lb/>business of educating youth, to which
            <lb/>occupied the greater portion of her 
            <lb/>life, she was earnest &amp; assiduous &amp; successful, de

            <pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_123_Armstrong_Mary-03.jpg" n="3"/>
            <p>
            <lb/>voting her fine talents &amp; varied &amp; ex
            <lb/>tensive knowledge with faithfulness
            <lb/>&amp; concern to the performance of her du
            <lb/>ties &amp; no doubt many of her pupils
            <lb/>??? a few of whom are now present
            <lb/>feel deep gratitude for her teach
            <lb/>instructions but for her advice her warn
            <lb/>during her last illness she
            <lb/>ings &amp; ?? rebukes showed great &amp; exemplify
            <lb/>patience under acute suffering
            <lb/>&amp; very delightful &amp; edifying humility of spirit.
            <lb/>While at Harrogate she called in a phy
            <lb/>sician, who candidly told her he saw no
            <lb/>hope whatever of her recovery. This led
            <lb/>her as she expressed herself in a Letter to
            <lb/>a friend, to examine herself more strict
            <lb/>ly as to her hopes for eternity; The conse
            <lb/>quence of this serious proving of her 
            <lb/>own self she states to be this, that she
            <lb/>was led, on the one hand to mourn
            <lb/>deeply over her unprofitable life; but
            <lb/>that on the other hand when humbly
            <lb/>confessing her sins &amp; imploring for
            <lb/>giveness she found it &amp; had peace
            <lb/>in the prospect of death. 
            <lb/>It is a singular remarkable feature in her of
            <lb/>the complaints from which she suffered
            <lb/>that it leads the patient almost to
            <lb/>the last to flatter himself with hopes
            <lb/>of recovery; &amp; in case he is a true
            <lb/>believer, it is not a little singular to
            <lb/>hear him, one moment speaking of
            <lb/>his trust in the Savr &amp; her good hope of
            <lb/>acceptance thro' grace, of death being
            <lb/>gave to himself as a child of God. 
            <lb/>She went declaring his expectation that
            <lb/>he will soon as well recover. The writer has
            <lb/>met with many instances of this sin
            <lb/>gular symptom of consumption in
            </p>
            <pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_123_Armstrong_Mary-04.jpg" n="4"/>
            <p>
            <lb/>the course of his ministry &amp; our
            <lb/>late sister was not the least striking 
            <lb/>among them, for frequently after
            <lb/>conversing in such a strain, that it
            <lb/>was clear she not only expected
            <lb/>death, but rejoiced in the prospect
            <lb/>of it, she suddenly turned the sub
            <lb/>ject to her hope of soon being well
            <lb/>again. But she said, to more than one
            <lb/>dear friend, "If I die, it will be a happy
            <lb/>exchange for me, I shall go to the Lord."
            <lb/>For our occassion addressing
            <lb/>she added said: I should wish to live
            <lb/>a few years longer, if it were the Lords
            <lb/>will, for some reasons you know; but for
            <lb/>me it will be better if I go." Another
            <lb/>consequence of her complaint was ex
            <lb/>cessive nervousness, so that she had a 
            <lb/>dread of seeing even her friends. Hence
            <lb/>her minister did not see her until it
            <lb/>became apparent that her end could not
            <lb/>after he had seen her once
            <lb/>be very distant; he then went up 
            <lb/>&amp; being visited he always was gladly
            <lb/>At the first interview he
            <lb/>welcome, had a satisfactory conversa
            <lb/>tion with her, in which she stated, that
            <lb/>she had not the smallest doubt of her ac
            <lb/>the conversation was followed by
            <lb/>ceptance, &amp; concluded with a prayer
            <lb/>on her behalf, she frequently adding
            <lb/>Amen to the petitions. Her choir la
            <lb/>bourer also frequently saw her &amp; had 
            <lb/>pleasing conversations with her. Now 
            <lb/>too, she admitted other ??? friends,
            <lb/>as well as her minister &amp; Labourer
            <lb/>more frequently. The medicine she
            <lb/>took caused her to ramble a good deal;
            <lb/>yet she was almost always collected
            <lb/>when spiritual subjects were bro<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi> be
            <lb/>fore her, &amp; answered every question 
            </p>
            <pb facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_123_Armstrong_Mary-05.jpg" n="5"/>
            <p>
            <lb/>as to her belief &amp; hope in a clear &amp; une
            <lb/>quivocal manner. To our friend she
            <lb/>declared, on being asked, that her only
            <lb/>trust was in our Lord &amp; Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Jesus, Amen.
            <lb/>To another, that she felt her Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> pre
            <lb/>sence, not uninterrupedly, indeed, 
            <lb/>but often &amp; that He blessed &amp; cheered
            <lb/>her most richly. She rejoiced to see her 
            <lb/>sister &amp; niece arrive from Dublin on
            <lb/>Sunday evening. The same afternoon
            <lb/>prayer having been offered up with her, a
            <lb/>few verses were sung, in which she
            <lb/>joined as well as she could; &amp; in 
            <lb/>the lines, "Here comes a sinner, who
            <lb/>would fain Thro' the Lambs entrance
            <lb/>gain" she made a strong effort
            <lb/>to sing with us. She was visited
            <lb/>twice aft The last time her minis
            <lb/>ter saw her was Tuesday morning; 
            <lb/>she was more collected, but in great
            <lb/>pain; of it she ejaculated a fervent
            <lb/>Amen! at the close of the prayer.
            <lb/>In the afternoon she attempted to
            <lb/>give some directions respecting her
            <lb/>worldly affairs to a friend, but was
            <lb/>scarcely intelligible. He
            <lb/>offered up the last prayer with her
            <lb/>??? length the moment of release
            <lb/>came, &amp; her redeemed spirit took
            <lb/>its flight; she was sensible to the last.
            <lb/>She added, that her state of mind
            <lb/>&amp; feeling was well expressed in that
            <lb/>verse of Toplady's beautiful hymn: No
