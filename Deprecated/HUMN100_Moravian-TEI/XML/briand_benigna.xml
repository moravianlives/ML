                  Here followed the 22nd of March our
                  dear Sister Benigna Briant.
                  She was born the 17th of December 1707at Syneham in 
                  Wilshire. Her Parents have been of the Quaker Religion
                  &amp; She was brought up in the same Principles.
                  Anno 1740 the 19th  februarywas She marryed to our Br.
                  Briand? &amp; they followed a religious Life according to 
                  her Principles, But as Br. lennick? in this bounty his
                  Preachings begun, She &amp; her Husband went to hear him
                  but Both got such an Impression at first that they offered
                  Br. lennick? their house for for a Preaching Place, that was
                  not all but they offered every Body who came to hear him
                  to harbour free. They bought at last a House &amp; provided
                  a Silence to preach therein.This occonomie (economy)continued 
                  many years, without finding hereby any Rest for their
                  own Heart. Br. lennick? was perfected? all round the 
                  Country, &amp; by that means our Sister often herself
                  in Danger of her Life. To the same Time it happened 
                  that a certain Man was soenragedabout Br. lennicks? 
                  Preachings from the Blood of Christ, that he made a
                  Plot with several wickedPeople that they would, Br. lennick? as his 
                  Auditory guide overstream with Blood of Oxen.
                  But this Man on a Sudden became mad &amp; clear Blood
                  ran out of his nose &amp; Mouth &amp; this continued several 
                  weeks under extraordinary Pain, his terrible &amp; furious 
                  Sooth made, that nobody would venture to come near 
                  him,
                  ///
                  till he at last with Howling &amp; bawlingwent to Eternity.
                  All his Companions found in some Way or other by &amp; by a
                  comendable End. In this restless Time, Br.Briant 
                  accompanyed Br. lennick? to London &amp; there lernt (learned)by 
                  that Opportunity to know the Brethrenm he was so over-
                  taken by the Grace of Christ among them, that he on 
                  his Retour testifyed it to his dear Wife to a great Im-
                  pression of her Heart. She directly begg'd him that he
                  would invite the Brethren to Wilshire, which done 
                  according to the general Desire of the awakened Souls 
                  in this Parts. Br. Schlicht was the first after Br. lennick? 
                  who was sent thiter (thither), his Testamony of Christ found Applause 
                  &amp; our Sister declared herself: for this Preachings of the 
                  Sake of our Saviour I venture my All. Now begun  
                  her Period wherein our Saviour begun to draw nearer 
                  to her Heart, her natural Fire begun by Degrees to 
                  dye &amp; the holy Ghost brought her in his School to a 
                  more childlike &amp; yielding Temper. As our Mr. Johanes 
                  1748 the 9 of Mayin Buttermere the Congregation 
                  errected she was baptiseth by him in the Death of 
                  Christ by the Name Benigna &amp; that was her Name 
                  by right &amp; the 22nd of September a.c. She was admitted to 
                  the holy Sacrament to a real &amp; remaining Blessing for her Heart.
                  She lived 7 Miles distant of us, but surely came every
                  Sunday to our Preaching &amp; that 6 years, till she removed
                  with her Husband to Bath. Here she entertained the Brethren 
                  as formerly which just now begun to visit and preach
                  in

               <p>
                  in this Parts, with all imaginable Tenderness &amp; wish'd
                  nothing more as that the Brethren would settle in this 
                  Place. In the meantime She &amp; her Husband visited diligently
                  at Bristol till 1757. a Society was errected at Bath.
                  Her House was the Residence of our Labourer &amp; She
                  made it her Pleasure to serve them. Our Saviour 
                  blessed her marrigage with 6 children, whereof 4 is 
                  ready by our Lord &amp; the rest is in the Care of the 
                  Congregation. Our blessed Sister had extra ordinary
                  Gifts of our Saviour. Her skillfull &amp; understanding 
                  Behaviour, &amp; the Maintainance of so many, of her poor 
                  Nighbours, which She with a willing Heart took upon
                  her, caused that every Body loved &amp; respected her.
                  Her Heart hung on our Saviours, &amp; his Death &amp; Suffering,
                  was the most delightfull object of her Soul.
                  By the last visit of Mr. &amp; Sister Nilshman on this Place
                  She came among the Hourly Intercessors, which was
                  a real Blessing to her &amp; She came never from her 
                  Conversation Hour with our Saviour without Tears
                  in her Eyes. I was with Plesure to behold how She 
                  from Day so became more tender &amp; intimate with her  
                  only Friend &amp; bloody Breidegroom of her Soul! Scarcely 
                  could a Body him name to her, then her Tears of
                  Love begun to flow. As She in June was in Bristol
                  She said: "Now I come not more hither, till I am to
                  be buryed here." the 13th She enjoyd our Lords Supper
                  the last time, &amp; not long after She was forced to lay down
                  &amp; as 
                  ///
                  it could be guessd; that She would get the Smal Pox.
                  One of her Daughters did all She could to hinder that her 
                  Dear Mother should not be perplept about it; to which 
                  She said: "My dear Child, why should I be afraid thereof,
                  Our Saviour must take one Say or another to promote my
                  Departing from this dying Body, if it is by this Way
                  his holy Will, that's all one to me." May he only give
                  me Patience, then my most happy Lot is to be with
                  him. the 16th of March, the Smal-Pox became visible,
                  She defyneth her Husband to absent himelf because
                  he had not to, &amp; declard to him that she was quite
                  resignd into the Hill of our Saviour. The following 
                  Day came her Daughter from Bristol to see her, to 
                  which she related the blessed Situation her was in.
                  The 21st as Mr. Miller asked her: if She intented
                  to go home. She replied: yes, that I will, if it is 
                  the Pleasure of my Saviour to fetch me. There is no
                  Misunderstanding between me &amp; him. Her Pain
                  She endured with astonishing Patience &amp; said:
                  What's that little Skinmark in Proportion to what our 
                  Saviour endured for my Sake. The Night following
                  a great Alteration happened by her. Her Daughter
                  inquired: Mommy will you really go home? "Yes replied 
                  She." but I must first see some Br. &amp; Sisters."
                  She then went for Br. &amp; Mr. Miller but as they came
                  she found her Preachless allready. They kept her a 
                  pretty Liturge &amp; under these Words: Der konig 
                  wende fich yu dir, und deine narde riech &amp; flew

                  her happy Soul into the Bosom of her bloody Bride 
                  groom. In the 56th Year of her Age Her Husband 
                  who had in his Sleep an Instinct of her
                  Departure, said as he awaked to the People in the House:
                  My Wife is gone, fell down on his Face &amp; thanked our 
                  dear Saviour for all the Blessings bestowed on her. Soon
                  after that, Mr. Miller came before his Door &amp; sung: Ihi
                  Mund ist mun erblasset in Jesu Arm is School, as
                  the 25th was her Corps upon her Desire brought to 
                  Bristol &amp; these intered.
                  the 25th Br. Rogers did the Act of his Function as 
                  Mr. Chapmann's Vicar performed the Prayer of the
                  english Church in the Church at Bath &amp; preach'd the 
                  Days following in his Country Chaples.
