					<l>The S. Sr Mary Gladhill who happily</l>
					<l>departed this life Dec 1st 1809, has</l>
					<l>left the following few lines concerning</l>
					<l>herself. July 26th 1727.</l>
					<l>I was born at Belly Bridge near Wyke</l>
					<l>and baptized in the Church of England</l>
					<l>from my earliest years I remember my</l>
					<l>Mother taking me to hear Mr Ingham</l>
					<l>preach, &amp; I felt at that time, some </l>
					<l>thing of our Saviours nearness, which</l>
					<l>I however did not fully understand </l>
					<l>besides my natural inclination being</l>
					<l>after the world. In my 16th</l>
					<l>year our whole family was afflicted</l>
					<l>with a bad fever, of which we all </l>
					<l>got better accept my Mother who</l>
					<l>dyed on it, we was now left in </l>
					<l>deplorable circumstances, I being the</l>
					<l>oldest of the Children; the towns</l>
					<l>people would give me no assistance, </l>
					<l>I had learned nothing to earn a lifely,</l>
					<l>hood, and was now obliged to go from </l>
					<l>door to door to beg my Bread, I </l>
					<l>met with many Kind Benefactors </l>
				</lg>

					<l>who pittied me in my distress; after</l>
					<l>sometime I went into service, from</l>
					<l>one place to another, I found it very</l>
					<l>hard &amp; met with many troubles; having</l>
					<l>no body to tell my concern to, nor</l>
					<l>to care for me, I prayed to the</l>
					<l>Lord to help me, about this time</l>
					<l>I became aquanited with the Srs</l>
					<l>Elizth &amp; Sarah Holdsworth, and went</l>
					<l>to live with them; they often spoke</l>
					<l>to me about our Saviour, and I felt their </l>
					<l>had </l>
					<l>concern &amp; good wishes for me, but no</l>
					<l>inclination to attend to it. I spent</l>
					<l>several years, in a very uneasy situation</l>
					<l>of mind, during this time I heart </l>
					<l>Mr Eastwood preach on that text</l>
					<l>of the ten Virgins, which had a par </l>
					<l>ticular effect upon my heart, for it </l>
					<l>was clear to me I was in the Class</l>
					<l>of the foolish virgins, I wept before</l>
					<l>our Saviour &amp; prayed him to have mercy</l>
					<l>upon me, &amp; to forgive me all my</l>
					<l>sins, I felt on this occation some, </l>
					<l>thing which I can not express,</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Our Saviour showed me his loving &amp;</l>
					<l>forgiving heart, and I felt that he</l>
					<l>had suffered, bled &amp; died for me.</l>
					<l>Being of an unsteady turn of mind I</l>
					<l>soon came into things again which was</l>
					<l>contrary to our Saviours will, an which</l>
					<l>account I spent many heavy hours</l>
					<l>but he always approved himself </l>
					<l>as my best friend, and took notice</l>
					<l>of me the poorest among the needy.</l>
					<l>Being now </l>
					<l>undetermined</l>
					<l>whether to make application to belong</l>
					<l>to the Brns Congn or to be a follower</l>
					<l>of Mr Eastwood, I prayed to our Savr </l>
					<l>to make it clear to me, which way to </l>
					<l>turn, and he convinced me the Brn</l>
					<l>where the people to whom I should</l>
					<l>belong. Upon this I made application </l>
					<l>and obtained leave to come and</l>
					<l>live in the Srs House at Gumersal,</l>
					<l>this favour was granted to me Oct</l>
					<l>10th 1760. for which I often thank</l>
					<l>our Saviour with my whole heart</l>
					<l>Thus far her own Account.</l>

					<l>Our late Sr was soon at home amongst</l>
					<l>us, and thankful for her Lot. </l>
					<l>Apr. 8th 1765 she was rec&apos;d into the</l>
					<l>Congn &amp; Apr. 26th the following</l>
					<l>year, she partook for the first</l>
					<l>time of the H. Comn. After living</l>
					<l>10 years in Gumersal she moved in</l>
					<l>1770 to Fulnek, into the Srs House</l>
					<l>here, where she spent the remainder</l>
					<l>of her days, &amp; tho she in that long</l>
					<l>period, met with many trials, both</l>
					<l>internal &amp; external, yet her simple</l>
					<l>reliance &amp; confidence in the Lord</l>
					<l>helped her thro in every case. </l>
					<l>She often used to say: &quot;Our Saviour</l>
					<l>and every body is very good to me</l>
					<l>I can never be thankfull enough,</l>
					<l>if I could only cleave closer to </l>
					<l>him, but he allways tells me, I am</l>
					<l>his, &amp; He will keep me to the end.</l>
					<l>It can truly be said, Her happy lot</l>
					<l>to know our Saviour &amp; herself and to </l>
					<l>live in the Congn  was highly vallued</l>
					<l>by her. She was contendt &amp; chearful</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>in poverty &amp; thankful for every good</l>
					<l>gift imparted to her, and injoyed the</l>
					<l>the Love &amp; good will of every one.</l>
					<l>In general she was blessed with good </l>
					<l>health, even in her old age, which also </l>
					<l>was a matter of great thankfulness to </l>
					<l>her. About two weeks before her </l>
					<l>departure she was seriously attaked</l>
					<l>with sickness &amp; womiting, but she thought</l>
					<l>herself better again, &amp; Nov. 25th she </l>
					<l>injoyed the H. Comn in fellowship</l>
					<l>with the Congn, finding herself still</l>
					<l>very weak &amp; her Cough growing trouble</l>
					<l>some, she submitted on the 30th to </l>
					<l>go into the Sikroom, on Dec. 1st being</l>
					<l>asked in the morning. how she felt, </l>
					<l>she said; &quot;Very well, I have no pain</l>
					<l>&quot; &amp; do not think I am going yet to </l>
					<l>&quot;our Saviour, but if it be his will</l>
					<l>&quot;to take me to himself, I am not </l>
					<l>&quot;only resigned, but shall be happy</l>
					<l>&quot;to be with him whom I love above</l>
					<l>all.&quot; She spent the day mostly in  </l>

					<l>a slumber and in afternoon about </l>
					<l>Choak she was blessed for her departure </l>
					<l>which occation our Saviours presence</l>
					<l>was sensibly felt, and soon after </l>
					<l>happy soul took flight into the </l>
					<l>arms of her Redeemer, in a gentle</l>
					<l>maner, without a groan &amp; seigh.</l>
