					I was Born in the town of Mirfield in Yorkshir in the year 1735 <lb />
					on the 29 of Sept, my parents belonging the Church of Ingland In my <lb />
					young years, begun to be Consarned about My Salvation &amp; was affraid <lb />
					of doing of saying any thing which would Displeas God for fear I Might <lb />
					not be saved one Night when I was about 6 years old I dreamt our <lb />
					Sav came into the Room were I was, as soon at I saw him got up &amp; ran <lb />
					to him &amp; pray&apos;d him to Bless me which he did &amp; I thought he Showd <lb />
					me a well in the side of the room In the which he said I Should be <lb />
					dipped of then I should be his it had such an Imprection on me <lb />
					that I never forgot it when the Brethen came to preach at foxwood <lb />
					I went with my Mother &amp; got a Love for them In some time after <lb />
					Bro Helt came to have the Care of the Children so he told us as Many <lb />
					us had a mind to be our Saviours Should wright a few lines to him <lb />
					which I did also his Meetings was peculery Blest to my heart &amp; <lb />
					When he told us of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> becoming Man and that he he was <lb />
					crusyfyed of had Recved So many wounds for as to perchase our Salvation <lb />
					I was very much lade hold on &amp; I wept Many times, as I grew older I <lb />
					felt my <add place="above">??? to to be put in here</add> Corruption more &amp; more which made me very heavy and <lb />
					glomy I thought Shurly there is not one that is So Spoiled &amp; So <lb />
					full of evel as I am, but the Convictions which felt I never went <lb />
					In no Gross sins yet I felt a love for Sin &amp; begun a self working <lb />
					a striving to become better, the More I Strove against it the <lb />
					worse I grew I often took Lonely walks were I might have my thoughts <lb />
					to myself &amp; allso pour out my Sighs to the Lord, evry thing I saw <lb />
					Increased my sorow they looked So happy &amp; evry thing answered <lb />
					the end for what they was formed for but as for me I lothed <lb />
					myself feeling Nought but Sin, I frequeuted the Meetings <lb />
					very Constant, I felt as if I was going to be juged for evry Word <lb />
					As the Bro spoke I tried my own Heart by it to feell if I <lb />
					Could get any hopes that our Sav would have Mercy on such a <lb />
					Rech as I am, when the Sisters came to Visit me Sis Lesel and <lb />
					Eunes Brook being Sisters that had a pecular Confidence to I <lb />
					felt a grate freedom to tell them my whole Heart as well as ever <lb />
					I Could in hopes that they Could Gess weather I should come thro or no <lb />
					they allways Comforted me &amp; told me it was a Grace that our Sav <lb />
					Let me feell what I was by nature &amp; allso that it was just such that <lb />
					our Sav came to save, but I being of a reasoning turn it seemed <lb />
					to be made to very esey &amp; except I felt our Savs Nearness so clear as <lb />
					&amp; I allmost saw him I dare not beleve &amp; so Long as I have not this <lb />
					Grace I will not have no other Comfort that is to be assured of the <lb />
					forgivness of all my Sins, so I went on fo some time struggling

					strugling with my Lods as a silly child for if I had a more Simple Heart <lb />
					I know I Might have found rest sooner, but my dear Sav whose Care <lb />
					I have been Shure of from a littell Child did not for all my unbeleve <lb />
					&amp; hardness of Heart did not leave his poor Child but followed me with <lb />
					Unweared patience tell he Could his ame fullfill so I went on till <lb />
					my 17 year when I begun to be tired of all my own attempts &amp; to See <lb />
					clearly I Could do Nothing of myself, so I thought if I perish it shall <lb />
					be at My Sav<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> feet, but one day when I was praying by myself I broke <lb />
					out in these words I am a Sinner this I know all in me deserving wo <lb />
					but Sence thou has dyed for me my Lamb I pray thee take me as I <lb />
					am, I had no Sooner giving myself into the Hands of my Sav, to live <lb />
					but my dearist Bridgroom manifested himself so clear before my <lb />
					Heart &amp; eys with all his wounds that I was quite overcome with his <lb />
					Beauty I felt that he had forgave me all my Sins &amp; the Lods I had <lb />
					Carried was quite gorn O how I felt I shall never forget my Heart <lb />
					was so Captivated with my Bloody Freind that he was become my <lb />
					Cheff Object O I cannot express the part what peace &amp; life my poor <lb />
					heart Injoyed for I can say with truth when in his Blood I saw him <lb />
					Swim a small drop I did get which glued me to him, him to me the <lb />
					First time that we meet, I began to think I Could like very Much <lb />
					to be in the Congregation tho, I felt myself very unworthy of that grace <lb />
					but I spoke with our Sav about it often, but leaving it at the Same time <lb />
					to his will for I was affrade of myself not answering the end, I never <lb />
					told my Cosarn to my Labours for I thought if our Saviour thinks <lb />
					good I Shall be Reced he will put it into the Bre &amp; Sis, hearts when it <lb />
					is the wright time, when I came to Fulneck my Labour told me I might <lb />
					wright to the Congrea, which was very welcome to me so I did &amp; Brought it to <lb />
					my labour, and in the year 1752 on the 13 of Nov I had the Grace to be <lb />
					Rec<hi rend="superscript">ed</hi> into the dear Cong, of which I felt myself very unworthy of but <lb />
					I gave myself up to our dear Sav &amp; wished to be a joy to him &amp; to his pepel <lb />
					soon after I had the unexpected news that I had leave to come in the Choir <lb />
					House which Suprised me; I allways had a pecular mind to be in the Choir <lb />
					house or Econemy but I thought it to grate a Grace for poor me, as soon as <lb />
					my parents Could get my things ready I came which was on the 3 of Feb <lb />
					1753 when I got my long wished for Desire granted to live in the Choir <lb />
					House were I lived a grate Girl tell the Mounth of Aug<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> the Singell <lb />
					Sisters fest being put of tell then on account of our dear Annajonah <lb />
					&amp; Jonas coming &amp; on the 15 of Augstt I was Rec<hi rend="superscript">ed</hi> into the Sisters Choir I felt <lb />
					a littell pain at parting with my Choir for had injoyed many Blessings
			</p>
<cb/>
			<p>
					Blessing from our Saviour in it but as it was his will I devoted myself to <lb />
					by dearist Bridegroom &amp; wished to become a true virgin Both in <lb />
					Soul &amp; Body to be intirely to his Heart in all things, in the year 1753 <lb />
					on Sep ye 9 I had the Grace to injoy for the First time the holy Screament <lb />
					for which I was quite bowed down feeling myself so unwothry of such Grace which <lb />
					I injoyed at that time when I was prevaded with his dear Corps &amp; Blood thro <lb />
					&amp; thro, in the year 1754 our dear papar &amp; Mammar pade us a Viset and we  <lb />
					had for the First time here a Choir Scrament &amp; foot washing the impretion of <lb />
					which I shall never forget it was as if our Sav &amp; me was quite alone for some <lb />
					time, in a wile after our dear Sav let me see More of myself that I had <lb />
					a grate deal in me that wanted to be dealing &amp; Sanktifyed thro our Saviours <lb />
					Grace My Disopition being of such a sort that when I See any thing I thought <lb />
					not right I was so hasty in speaking which Brought me often into Uneseyness <lb />
					but our Best Friend allways brought me soon to the Sinner point &amp; let me <lb />
					feell what a poor Child I was and would not let me be Sattifyed if I had Severd <lb />
					from him in any thing till I felt his Forgiveness, in May 1761 I  was made <lb />
					use of Amongst the Girls for which I felt myself very unfetlt but it proved <lb />
					a Blessed Scoul for my own Heart I got to see many things in myself that <lb />
					I was Egrant of and made me Cleave Closer to our dearist Sav for his daly <lb />
					instruction &amp; sweet nearness to bring me thro in all things According to his <lb />
					Heart, and I Can never be thankfull enofe for all the Grace &amp; Blessing <lb />
					which I poor Child have injoyed in my Choir the Congreation and  <lb />
