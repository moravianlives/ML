					<lb />Hannah Clarl was born in Northowrm near
					<lb />Hallifax, Decber 1727 and in the year 43 She heard
					<lb />the Gospel preachd, along with her Sister, after
					<lb />some time our Saviour Laid hold on her heart
					<lb />in Such a manner, that She had a great desier
					<lb />to be long to the Society, but being of a bashfull
					<lb />deposishon, She Could not say much for her
					<lb />self, thinking herself not worthy of Such a Saviour
					<lb />but being in Coragd by her Sr She howeve took
					<lb />Corage and was soon received into the Socity at
					<lb />Hallfax by Br Horn; in ye year 48 She came to
					<lb />Live at Cloketon EOconemy where She Cou<hi rend='strikethrough:true;'>l</hi> was
					<lb />some time before She cou&apos;d rightly Settle after
					<lb />ter wards, She growing more acquainted with our Saviour
					<lb />And grew more Satisfid in the year 50. She remov&apos;d
					<lb />to with the rest of the Srs to Tyrselhall, were She got
					<lb />a gret Longing and desier to be recived into the
					<lb />Congregation, which was granted to her jan<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> ye 12.
					<lb />1752: the Day after She was Rec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi>, the Sr Askd her
					<lb />why She was in such a hury to go to grace hall, the day that
					<lb />She was Recived, She being alway usd to be one of the
					<lb />Last, O said she I had some thing in my mind, I thought
					<lb />perhaps I Shall be recievd therefore I did not Like
					<lb />to be to Late, I had a feeling of it but, I did not Like
					<lb />to tell any body of it, When the Sisters Enterd the
					<lb />Choir-hous She with Some others was orderd to Live
					<lb />in pudsey Town, which grived her very much, and
					<lb />She said, She Cou&apos;d not reast till She Came to Live
					<lb />in the Choir-hous, July ye 15 53 She became a
					<lb />Candidat for the Sacrament ye 4th of Nov. in the same
					<lb />year She was Confirmd, and Decber ye 6th She pertook of
					<lb />the holy Sacrament, for the first time; this provd with a
					<lb />great bless to her, from this time forward she grew
					<lb />much more Lively and Chearfull then ever, She had
					<lb />been before, once as She was going to the Meeting She
					<lb />fell and hurt her knee, her Father being a Dacter She
					<lb />went to Stay there a while, to see if she Could be Cur&apos;d
					<lb />but While She was there, She was much dissatisfid
					<lb />and wanted to be at home again, in the Mean time the
					<lb />Pudsey EOconemy Came to live in the Choir-hous her Sr
					<lb />Going to see her, She Askd her if they was moved, She
					<lb />told her Yes, then said She were is my bed and the rest
					<lb />of my things, are they in the Choir-hous? She asuerd her

					<lb />that her bed was in the sleep-hall, this rejoiced her
					<lb />Very much and She said I am Satisfied if I only
					<lb />have the faviour to be in the Hous, She Coud not
					<lb />be Satisfied to stay any Longer with her father
					<lb />but hastend to come home, and enterd her Choir
					<lb />house with much pleasuer; ever since She got that
					<lb />hurt in her knee, She has been Sickley, So that on
					<lb />could planly see that she was in a declining way
					<lb />Since that time nothing, during this her Sickness nothing
					<lb />has hapend to destirb her in her Couers of grace but
					<lb />She has gone on in a simple, and Child Manner, About
					<lb />Christmas 55 She got a bad Cough, and it seem&apos;d as if
					<lb />it wou&apos;d turn to a Cunsumtion, Last janry her Sr went
					<lb />to visit her father, She Ask her what She Shoud Say to
					<lb />him about her, She said I have not much for fisik at
					<lb />present, perhaps byenby I Shall want it more then
					<lb />now, She was very Still and Complaind but Little
					<lb />but when She by degrees grew wors, She had a mind
					<lb />to try if enything Could be of servis to her, She
					<lb />then Sent to her father but he Said it wou&apos;d be to no
					<lb />perpos however She took something which gave
					<lb />her Eas&apos; for a short time, but however it was very deserna-
					<lb />ble, that her End drew near, this She belived herself
					<lb />and at first She took it very Near to heart; that
					<lb />She hat not Spent her time in such a tender, Connecttion
					<lb />with the man of Sorrows as She Could have wich&apos;d
					<lb />She spoke of it to her Sister, but however, said She
					<lb />He: Loves me dearly, and has patiene with me; about
					<lb />the middle of June, She took to ye Sick-room, when
					<lb />She was Ask&apos;d if She Shoud not Like to, be well again
					<lb />She answerd No! I will rather go to our Saviour, wile
					<lb />She was in the Sick-room, She went once it to the
					<lb />hall to the holy Sacrament, when She came home
					<lb />again, She was so ill that we thought She would have gone
					<lb />directl; but in a little time She recoverd again; when she
					<lb />Said I am acceding glad that I have enjoy&apos;d it once more
					<lb />with the Congregation, for it is the Last time, She
					<lb />was exceeding Light and Chearfull, and said I Can&apos;t
					<lb />Express in words, what I have enjoid by the holy
					<lb />Sacrament my heart is So refreachd that it has made
					<lb />me quit Strong, yet my Longing and desier is to go to him
					<lb />who has done so much for me, O I wish that that happier
					<lb />time may soon Come, She was thro&apos; her whole sickness
				
			</p>
				<cb/>
			<p>
					<lb />Exceeing patient and when Any one told her that
					<lb />She Lookd very ill O said she I am to be ill, but it is no
					<lb />matter; will bear it as well as I Can, it will soon be over
					<lb />then I shall be quit well,
					<lb />About a Month ago her Class Sisters gave her a fair-
					<lb />well Love-feast at which She was very much delighted
					<lb />this was the Last time of her Comeing out of the Sickroom
					<lb />When She was spoke to for the Sacrament the Last
					<lb />time, She Expressd, her Longing desier for it, O Said
					<lb />She I would gladly have been with our Saviour before;
					<lb />this time it will however be the Last, I Shall now soon be
					<lb />with our Saviour; the fourth of this month, She pertook
					<lb />of the holy Sacrament, with such A longing and
					<lb />Eager heart, that She Cou&apos;d Scarely wait till the
					<lb />time Came, when She got the bread into her hands it
					<lb />Cant be express&apos;d in words, how Eger she was, as
					<lb />also when she took the Cup, it seemt as tho&apos; She
					<lb />thought it was the Last time that I shall enjoy it here
					<lb />I will now take my fill, A few day before her Departure
					<lb />her Cough Stop&apos;d and She grew weaker, the Night
					<lb />before her departuer She keept a very hearty band
					<lb />with the Sister who watchd with her, and thank&apos;d
					<lb />her for all that which She had don for her, She now
					<lb />alterd and one Coud see that her hour of Departuer
					<lb />Drew Nigh, She Calld out very often for our Saviour
					<lb />to fetch her, and not to Let her Stay to Long here, She
					<lb />wou&apos;d often Stretch out her Arme as if She Catchd at
					<lb />something, saying O he is my dear Saviour He is my
					<lb />dear Saviour, O Come my dearst Lamb, Come to
					<lb />fetch me, take me into thy Armes, then She said
					<lb />to her Sr Now I am satisfied, She said with wat art thou
					<lb />Satisfied? She answerd with our Saviour he Lets me
					<lb />fell his tender heart, and how much he loves me, ten
					<lb />times more then I Could expect? She then feeling her
					<lb />Self just redy for going, She sent for Sr Dorgy, She
					<lb />thinking them not quick enough, Crid out pray Come
					<lb />soon
					<lb />When thay Came they began to Sing some Verses
					<lb />Sutiable there to, but She however Recoverd again
					<lb />and Lay quit still only Desiering the Sisters
					<lb />to pray our Saviour that he would soon fetch, her
					<lb />Which happend, about half an houer past Eleven in
					<lb />the the forenoon, on the eleventh instant when her

					<lb />Soul took flight into the Armes of her Eternal
					<lb />Bridegroom under those words at he End of all her
					<lb />Need, be her Unction wounds so red; grant her
					<lb />to Lean unshaken &amp;c. will She thy thy gental
					<lb />Visag &amp;c pail kiss her upon the heart,
					<lb />Open Armes take her,
					<lb />Under which words she recived the blessing

					<lb />Countenenc was plainly to be seen the sweet impresh
					<lb />ion of the Last Kiss, so that al around her
					<lb />Could have wish for that blesst Lot
