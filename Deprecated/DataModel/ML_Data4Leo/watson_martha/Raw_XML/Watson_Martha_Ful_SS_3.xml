					<l>The S Sr Martha Watson who departed </l>
					<l>this life June 21st 1810. was born July, 11.</l>
					<l>the	</l>
					<l>1743 in Pudsey &amp; bap. in Presbitirian</l>
					<l>Church. As a Child she came often errands</l>
					<l>to Fulnek &amp; used to say she would like</l>
					<l>to live here, but her Father being not</l>
					<l>inclined towards the Brns Congn she</l>
					<l>met with no incouragement, when she</l>
					<l>was 15 years her father departed this</l>
					<l>this life, &amp; she was now obliged to go </l>
					<l>to service, she went to several places</l>
					<l>and at last to Hallifax, where she</l>
					<l>met with a very good Mrs, still</l>
					<l>it always dwelt on her mind, &amp; she</l>
					<l>felt a Call in her heart to the Brn</l>
					<l>Congn not being able to withstand</l>
					<l>it any longer she made application</l>
					<l>and March 12th 1772 she obtained</l>
					<l>leave to live in the Srs House at </l>
					<l>Gumersal, she stayed here a little above</l>
					<l>a year, and was then removed to Ful</l>
					<l>nek and placed in the School Kitshen</l>
					<l>as to have management of it.</l>

					<l>the first line of the H Comn, She</l>
					<l>often used to relate that this period</l>
					<l>from her receiption till she had the</l>
					<l>favour to injoy the H Comn was the </l>
					<l>most remarkable in her life, it was</l>
					<l>the time when she learned to know</l>
					<l>herself, and as a poor undone Sinner</l>
					<l>Saviors</l>
					<l>found grace in our sight. </l>
					<l>In the before mentioned sitiation she</l>
					<l>served 29 years with great faithful</l>
					<l>ness on which account she was respected,</l>
					<l>she had many difficulties to struggle</l>
					<l>it</l>
					<l>with, and had very hard in the be</l>
					<l>ginning, but she looked to our Saviour</l>
					<l>for help, and often expressed her gratitude</l>
					<l>for what he had done for her. </l>
					<l>Being rather of a selfrighteous turn</l>
					<l>&amp; not the best temper, it was at times</l>
					<l>troublesome for those who where con</l>
					<l>nected with her, but knowing her</l>
					<l>intentions were good, every allowence</l>
					<l>were made. In 1802 she came to live</l>
					<l>in the Srs House here, being troubled</l>
					<l>with the Rheumatism; and feeling her</l>
					<l>self not able to continue in her</l>
					<l>past, this was however a great trial</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>to her, being used to an actife life, she</l>
					<l>could not compose mind to have </l>
					<l>to do</l>
					<l>an </l>
					<l>nothing besides she felt such atach</l>
					<l>ment to her School &amp; the Children, that</l>
					<l>she hartly ever got over it, we had</l>
					<l>often to shear &amp; comfort her on that </l>
					<l>account. The few years she spent in</l>
					<l>in our house she was very weak &amp; </l>
					<l>infirm, in spring 1809 it appeared </l>
					<l>as if she was going in a decline,</l>
					<l>but she recovered a little again, &amp; it</l>
					<l>since</l>
					<l>terminated in a dropsy, from the</l>
					<l>beginning of this year she labored</l>
					<l>under much pain &amp; sufferings, some</l>
					<l>long </l>
					<l>times the time would appear to</l>
					<l>her before our Saviour would release</l>
					<l>her, but upon the whole she bore</l>
					<l>her pains with patience &amp;</l>
					<l>resignation to our Saviours will,</l>
					<l>to him </l>
					<l>&amp; prayed often to claanee her in</l>
					<l>his precious blood form every stain,</l>
					<l>that she may as a pardoned sinner</l>
					<l>appear him. This favour was granted</l>
					<l>to her June 21, when she happily</l>
					<l>fell asleep in Jesus. Aged nearly </l>
					<l>67 years.</l>
