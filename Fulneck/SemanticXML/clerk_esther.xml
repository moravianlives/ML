					Memoirs of the late happily departed Sister <lb />
					Esther Cleake who on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May 1791 <lb />
					at Fulneck enterd into the joy of her Lord
					In the 76<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year of her age.</p>
					<p>
					She has left the following account concerning <lb />
					her Pilgrimage here below.</p>
					<p>
					I think my dear Brethren &amp; Sisters will <lb />
					like to hear somthing of my Course through <lb />
					this time which I will gladly relate to the <lb />
					honour of my dearest Saviour. I was Born at <lb />
					Kirton in Lincolnshire, <add place="above">July 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1715</add> my Parents died when <lb />
					I was very young, was therefore left an Orphan <lb />
					to Providence, or to my dear Creator &amp; Saviour <lb />
					for whom I was born &amp; destined surely.</p>
					<p>
					To tell my dear Brethrening &amp; Sisters of the <lb />
					Goodness, the mercy &amp; kindness, the love &amp; faithfulness <lb />
					of My dear Lord &amp; Saviour to me a poor Child. <lb />
					my weak words fall very short to express the <lb />
					praise that is due to him, from me, for his wonders <lb />
					have been without end, thanks, thousand thanks <lb />
					be to the Lamb for ever &amp; ever. I will now relate <lb />
					some of the particulars of the tender lendings of <lb />
					My gracious &amp; most faithfull Lord. The first <lb />
					impression of grace I remember, was when I was <lb />
					about four Years old, when one day kneeling by <lb />
					a choir with a book in my hand, in which was those <lb />
					words, Seek and ye shall find knock, &amp; it shall

			<p>
					shall be append unto You, I felt somthing <lb />
					particular at the time, I had a very quick under <lb />
					standing for my years, and a very sensible feeling <lb />
					of what was right, and wrong I wanted to be a good <lb />
					Child that I might go to Heaven, on that account <lb />
					I was much praised, which wou&apos;d have been more <lb />
					hurtfull to me, but the dear Holy Ghost who had  <lb />
					begun his work in my heart, pleased me continualy, my <lb />
					wicked and sinfull nature, which kept me low &amp; <lb />
					consions that I did not deserve that praise, which <lb />
					was a grace to me at that time, so it checked my <lb />
					Satanick pride, which I felt very sensible, Yet  <lb />
					from many circumstances I thought God must <lb />
					love me, but how it was I cou&apos;d not tell, I have <lb />
					I was a sinner, In my 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I was very thought <lb />
					full and distress&apos;d, felt guilt with the impression <lb />
					that I did not love God, nor cou&apos;d I promise him <lb />
					which one day a little bird was made use of to  <lb />
					shew me that I cou&apos;d not praise my Creator even <lb />
					as a Bird cou&apos;d I had also strange Idea&apos;s about <lb />
					him, what kind of a form he had, and was much <lb />
					perplexed about it at this time I had a dream where <lb />
					in I thought God allmighty was in a parlour in  <lb />
					the house where I was, and that he was a Man of <lb />
					which I was very glad, &amp; thought then One cou&apos;d be <lb />
					familliar with him. But not understanding the  <lb />
					gracious lending of my dear Saviour, I continued
					<note type="catchword">extremly</note>
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					extremly distress&apos;d, thought I commited Sin <lb />
					evry moment by the strange thoughts I had, &amp; <lb />
					they was of such a nature, I cou&apos;d not tell them <lb />
					to any body, nor wou&apos;d they have understood me, <lb />
					but wearied indeed with trying to help myself <lb />
					a thought came in my mind, As I can not help <lb />
					these thoughts God Almighty has nothing <lb />
					against me. In that moment my mercifull <lb />
					and compassinate Saviour drew near with his <lb />
					love and gave me peace, it was as If he said to <lb />
					me, I have nothing against thee, I was amazed <lb />
					but did not know how to account for it, to be <lb />
					loved by God in such a manner, from that time <lb />
					When those thoughts came again I cou&apos;d believe <lb />
					he had nothing against me for it, but not under <lb />
					standing the right poor Sinners path I came into <lb />
					an esteem self rightious course, Striveing with <lb />
					all my might to be good by other means then <lb />
					Jesus blood, I fasted &amp; prayd, wanting to be as <lb />
					good as the Primitive Christians, not likeing any <lb />
					one to be better then myself, here my Satanick <lb />
					pride show&apos;d itself to a great degree, All how <lb />
					unwilling was I to be saved by grace I went on <lb />
					for some time in <add place="above">this</add> manner. My Aunt dieing who <lb />
					brought me up, I became a Second time an Orphan <lb />
					indeed She treated me as If She had known my <lb />
					destination. Ah the wonders of My dear Saviours <lb />
					love which I did not then understand through

					His kind providence in My 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I went <lb />
					to London into Lady Scarborough&apos;s Family. <lb />
					who had sent for me to wait on her little Neice <lb />
					and My dear Saviour put it into her heart from the first <lb />
					moment to be remarkable kind to me, and the whole <lb />
					family shew&apos;d a great regard &amp; respect for my religious <lb />
					turn of mind, which they found was sincere <lb />
					(not on account of outward gifts or quatifications) <lb />
					but the dear Holy Ghost in whose School I then <lb />
					was, gave me a constant sence of My depraved <lb />
					nature in all it shapes, and finding I fell so far <lb />
					short of what I thought I shou&apos;d be, this kept <lb />
					me low and in some sence humble, and kept the <lb />
					ballance against that hartfull prais which is <lb />
					often given. I served also in several other families <lb />
					namely Lord Orrory, Lady Charlott Edan&apos;s &amp; <lb />
					the Duke of Buckclugh. My dear Saviour <lb />
					and most faithfull Shepherd helped me through <lb />
					with all my imperfections so wonderfully <lb />
					that If I may humbly say so, I found favour <lb />
					with God, &amp; Man, but I nor no body else, thought <lb />
					what was prepareing for me. In my 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I <lb />
					return&apos;d to Lady Scarborough who always received <lb />
					me with the greatest kindness, At this time I fell <lb />
					again into self working fasted &amp; prayed much, till I  <lb />
					was quite weared finding it did me no good, Once in <lb />
					the Year 42 while at prayer I felt somthing very <lb />
					blessed, it was quick like the fleeting of a Star
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					but it seemed to me all that was good, it was <lb />
					Light Peace, Joy, all happiness in One moment <lb />
					I thought it was the Holy Spirit, &amp; praied to <lb />
					feel more of it. Soon after I received a letter <lb />
					concerning the preaching of the Methodists which <lb />
					I had never heard of. I was very much biggote to <lb />
					the Church &amp; thought it a shame to go any where else <lb />
					I thought how ever I wou&apos;d inquire about them what <lb />
					kind of people they wear, it happend at this time a <lb />
					Methodist came in My way, and by his conversation <lb />
					I was convinced of what I wanted, the knowledge of the <lb />
					atonement of our Saviour for My Sins, then all his <lb />
					gracious leading was brought to my mind so that I <lb />
					knew it was a faith from God, the person lent me <lb />
					a <del>Sermon</del> book of Sermons of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitfields <lb />
					the more I read the more it was opened to me that <lb />
					I wanted a Saviour, for my mind took a turn and <lb />
					I found some rest from my <add place="above">hard</add>labour, and saw that it <lb />
					was Christs rightousness that I wanted, I enterd <lb />
					with my whole mind into the matter, got all the <lb />
					books I cou&apos;d of that kind amongst the rest I got <lb />
					the Brethrens little Hymn book which sat&apos;d me <lb />
					exceedingly <del>well</del> espicialy One Verse, viz: If I <lb />
					glimse in My own breast Feel of a Christian bliss <lb />
					Then on the truth of it let me rest. That such a <lb />
					Life there is. At length my good Lady found I had <lb />
					got Methodist books, but did not think I was so deep <lb />
					in the matter, for She had a better opinion of me <lb />
					then that I wou&apos;d follow such people, but one time

					being with her at Court, She caught me reading a <lb />
					letter which she took from me, wherein She found I <lb />
					had been Once at the Tabernacle, She was much <lb />
					concern&apos;d &amp; took the greatest pain possible to diss <lb />
					waid me from it, but I was Devinly convinced of <lb />
					the truth of the Gospel, my Lady forbid me to go <lb />
					to the Tabernacle, I told her I <del>cou&apos;d</del> wou&apos;d not with <lb />
					out leting her Ladyship know, I thought I cou&apos;d do <lb />
					with books &amp; Stay at Home, at this time the family <lb />
					went into the Country, where was a good friend a <lb />
					Minister who took great pain to prevent my <lb />
					going too deep in my present Ideas, he brought me <lb />
					many books but to no purpose, my heart was afraid <lb />
					of the truth, We return&apos;d to London and I grew very <lb />
					uneasy, found I cou&apos;d not be faithful without <lb />
					going to hear the preaching, I therefore desired <lb />
					leave, which was not granted. My good Lady was <lb />
					now very much distress&apos;d about me, She wanted <lb />
					to keep me, &amp; out of Love &amp; kindness she did her <lb />
					<del>when</del> what She cou&apos;d to perswaid me, She wanted <lb />
					me again to be advis&apos;d by some Minsters, <lb />
					I chose the Bishop of Oxford (Sacher) for that <lb />
					purpose I was so clear in My matter I feared no-  <lb />
					thing, my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> went with me to the Bishop and <lb />
					accused me of leaving the Church, I told him <lb />
					it was because they did not preach our Saviours <lb />
					Sufferings, &amp; I was fully asured nothing else
						<note type="catchword">cou'd</note>
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					cou&apos;d save me, this he aprov&apos;d of, as to good work <lb />
					I said, when the tree is good, the fruit will be good, <lb />
					he was very tender with me finding I was Sincere <lb />
					If it was possible I was more confirm&apos;d in my point <lb />
					then before, My dear Lady was much dissapointed <lb />
					but I cou&apos;d not help it, here She rested, she had <lb />
					done all She cou&apos;d but My matter remained to leave <lb />
					her, or have leave to to go to the preachings, at last <lb />
					I con&apos;d do no longer, therefore went to hear the <lb />
					preaching, I was wanted before I came home again, <lb />
					My Lady ask&apos;d me where I had been, I told her, She <lb />
					said I had gone without leave, I said because her <lb />
					Ladyship wou&apos;d not have given the leave If I had <lb />
					ask&apos;d upon this She sent me out of the room <lb />
					to see me no more, She was affraid to keep me on <lb />
					account of the Children &amp; Servants, least I shou&apos;d <lb />
					bring them into my way of thinking, &amp; when I went <lb />
					with her to Court it was a shame at that time to be <lb />
					a Methodest. But My dear Saviour had prepared <lb />
					my way for me, I went to bed as composed as if <lb />
					nothing had happened, In the morning I rose with <lb />
					great chearfulness, like a Bird releas&apos;d from a <lb />
					Cage, and agent to the Tabernacle at 6 o&apos;Clock from <lb />
					Cavendish Square, which was a wonder of God for I <lb />
					had nothing, nor any prospect how I shou&apos;d get my <lb />
					bread, had very little money, many hard things was <lb />
					set before me, and in myself nothing to depend on, nor <lb />
					had I any acquaintance here, Our dear Saviours

					words became litterally true, seek first the <lb />
					Kingdom of God &amp; its Righteousness and all things <lb />
					shall be added unto You, I was like a Child <lb />
					turn&apos;d out of doors (was again an Orphan) But <lb />
					my ever faithfull Lord whose Hand &amp; Eye was over <lb />
					me cared for me in evry respect. My Lady gave me <lb />
					proof more of her kindness to me, finding I had <lb />
					no acquaintance, sent me word that I shou&apos;d lodge <lb />
					there till I cou&apos;d find a home the Servants was <lb />
					amaized at me, because I was otherwise no person <lb />
					of courage, but they did not know that I had found <lb />
					the Pearl of great price. I stay&apos;d with my Brother <lb />
					in the day time till the preaching time at the <lb />
					Tabernacle, my Brother was very shy to me, he was <lb />
					sorry for My leaving such a good place. He look&apos;d <lb />
					into my books, made a good observation &amp; said all <lb />
					professions make the Scriptures there rule, but <lb />
					If this inward feeling can be true it must come from <lb />
					God. It pleased he to hear him say so much. <lb />
					I enquir&apos;d of him for the Brethrens Chapel that I  <lb />
					might see the people to whom by little Hymn Book <lb />
					belong&apos;d (this was in Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1744) He directed me <lb />
					but when I came to Fetter Lane there was no preaching, <lb />
					I enquir&apos;d at the Chapel House S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wheeler kindly <lb />
					ask&apos;d me to come in Shewed me the Chapel, and what <lb />
					She told the at that time of Our Saviour walking <lb />
					amongst his People, made such an impression on
						<note type="catchword">me</note>
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					me that I never shall forget. It Tallied with my own <lb />
					experience, I enquired if the Countes of Zinzendorf <lb />
					did not want a Servant, but heard She was not in England. <lb />
					I went to Speak with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitfield to advise with <lb />
					him, and found him at B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Syms&apos;s, I told them my <lb />
					case just as it was, S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Syms according to her kind way <lb />
					in such cases took me into her house, thus I left my <lb />
					good Lady &amp; all my old Friends, with greatfull <lb />
					thanks for all their kindness &amp; I heartly pray that <lb />
					My dear Lady May not loose her reward, I cou&apos;d do no <lb />
					other but follow my gracious Lord and Saviour, B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; <lb />
					S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Syms Shewed me great kindness, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitfield &amp; <lb />
					his Wife was also very kind to me, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitfield <lb />
					going to George in about six weeks, this connexion <lb />
					was ended. B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Syms being atach&apos;d to the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> <lb />
					I often went with them to Fetterlane, I had receive&apos;d <lb />
					many blessings by going to the Tabernacle, at this <lb />
					time B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Syms moved, from which time I left off <lb />
					going to the Taber. Now my good Lord led me Step <lb />
					by Step as it pleased him both inwardly &amp; outwardly <lb />
					in a most gracious manner which brings these lines <lb />
					to my mind. With patience immense, And love so <lb />
					intense, He hath led me on, I&apos;m lost in amazment <lb />
					When thinking thereon. Now being come to my proper <lb />
					home, the dear Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> where I have enjoy&apos;d more blessings <lb />
					then I am able to express, they have been so many, and so <lb />
					great, and my call to the dear Congn is so clear and weighty <lb />
					to me, that I can say, next to our Saviour, the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> is the
						<note type="catchword">dearest</note>

					dearest thing to me, I am a Sinner to whom belongs <lb />
					nothing but shame &amp; confusion of face, but it has <lb />
					pleased him to open to me the treasure of his Love <lb />
					&amp; great Salvation, which has been sealed to me by <lb />
					his Spirit, by his Word, by his Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> as an eternal truth <lb />
					for such was my make that I must know it as a truth <lb />
					for myself, was truly convinced of unbeliefs, and my <lb />
					enmity against our Saviour, when this came to the <lb />
					highest pitch, I thought If there was another Saviour <lb />
					I wou&apos;d have him, I felt condemned for the thought <lb />
					and in that moment I was overpowerd with the <lb />
					love and peace of my dear Saviour, and as If he <lb />
					said to me for all this I love thee. The feeling <lb />
					and impression of his nearness, bow&apos;d me down in <lb />
					the dust before my gracious Lord, with this <lb />
					Sensation, The poor Sinners happy feeling, the holy <lb />
					shame. But My selfrighteousness still <lb />
					troubled me in various shapes, but in that feeling <lb />
					the following verse was sealed to me as the greatest <lb />
					truth, O precious precious blood, The only Holiness <lb />
					that&apos;s good, Still drop, &amp; flow &amp; cover me, it <lb />
					cursed Sinner without thee. The Scripture, the <lb />
					preachings, the Hymns, where open&apos;d with such <lb />
					truth &amp; Life which I can&apos;t describe.</p>
					<p>
					I left B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Syms with greatfull thanks for <lb />
					all their care, and went to live with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Delamott <lb />
					at Black Heath to take care of Betsey Holand <lb />
					her Parents being gone to Germany, here I experienc&apos;d
						<note type="catchword">something</note>
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					something particular in the first place to my shame. <lb />
					I was shewn such love and respect from this dear <lb />
					family, but what relates particularly to the heart <lb />
					was as I have said the preachings had been so blessed <lb />
					to me, being now all at once taken from all meetings, <lb />
					which I felt much store by, it was amazing to me <lb />
					that I now enjoy&apos;d such a Sabatic stillness &amp; a <lb />
					Sunshine of peace for that time, that I wanted <lb />
					nothing, but was indeed as a Child at the breast. <lb />
					I was not Yet in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> tho&apos; I had defer&apos;d it some <lb />
					time. B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holand how comeing from Germany <lb />
					I went with their Daughter to live with them. <lb />
					I now thought much about being received into the <lb />
					Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, but I had still to wait some time, which <lb />
					was very wholsome for the I was once much comforted <lb />
					by these words, Jesus thy affairs will think on, <lb />
					as thy ever loveing Head. At length the hour which <lb />
					certainly at the right moment, the Divine impression <lb />
					to me was, I am now in by Fathers House, this was <lb />
					May 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1747, and the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of Sep<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> following I had <lb />
					the unspeakable grace to be a partaker of my dear <lb />
					Saviours body &amp; blood in the Holy Sacrament.</p>
					<p>
					In this period ah! how good &amp; blessd was the Liturgies <lb />
					&amp; all the Meeting to my poor heart beyond all expres <lb />
					sion, I had the grace to feel that in myself I was <lb />

					to keep me low as a sinner, my dear B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> <lb />
					will understand what that sensation is a solid <lb />
					feeling what is sin, but <unclear>not to touch sin God forbid</unclear> <lb />
					In this Year I went to live at Mile end with the <lb />
					Children here I had new appearings of my dear Saviours <lb />
					Love and grace especially relating to my Choir. I <lb />
					was drawn to read the Canticles &amp; these Disciples <lb />
					of our Saviours love to his Church was opend to <lb />
					me with such truth &amp; reallity as I can&apos;t express <lb />
					The following verse was much impressed on my mind <lb />
					at this time, O thou the fairest of mankind</p>
					<p>
					Thy beauty strike both heart &amp; mind. But <lb />
					nothing is so fair in thee. As thy sweet form <lb />
					upon the tree and can thro&apos; his love &amp; grace say <lb />
					Nothing has so struck me. As when God&apos;s <lb />
					Spirit took me too Golgotha O God be prais&apos;d <lb />
					This has a period in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of some extravegances <lb />
					But can say for myself I am truly convinc&apos;d <lb />
					by my own experiance that there was a glory <lb />
					from the Lord, indeed too great for earthly minds <lb />
					long to bear, but I expect to see it again in <lb />
					perfection without a Vail between, and with <lb />
					the whole Sinners train surround that Cavity <lb />
					where I shall dwell eternally, at this time <lb />
					that verse was realised to my heart, To be <lb />
					enamour&apos;d I know well, To have the heart quite <lb />
					overflowing, For him alone to be so glowing <lb />
					Expressions only me here fail. About this
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
					this time I also had a new school for my own heart <lb />
					concerning the Virgin Station, and found that only <lb />
					by partaking of the Nature of the only Virgin man <lb />
					one cou&apos;d deserve that Character, this was made <lb />
					very clear to me, Fair gifts of my creation, quite <lb />
					spirit&apos;d made me disspair for this grace, the <lb />
					knowledge of myself (in this particular) I adore &amp; <lb />
					thank my dear Lord &amp; his Spirit for teaching me <lb />
					the way to turn to his precious blood, which alone <lb />
					can cleanse our hearts and make all good, I found <lb />
					it an antidote against all those sins that stick <lb />
					so close to our nature.</p>
					<p>
					In the year 1751 I was sent to care for the Single <lb />
					S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in Ockbrook and in Sep<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1757 I receiv&apos;d a call <lb />
					to go to Tytherton for the same purpose, and arrived <lb />
					there in the Angels <gap reason="illegible"/>, this Jurney I shall <lb />
					never forget, it was very much bless&apos;d to me through <lb />
					the nearness of my gracious Lord, and the impression <lb />
					I had of the aid of his dearAngels, July 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1763 <lb />
					I return&apos;d again to Ockbrook, and Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1772 <lb />
					I arrived in London where I hope to finish my poor <lb />
					&amp; insignificant labour, In all these places my <lb />
					best Friend has help&apos;d me through in wholesome <lb />
					poverty both internally &amp; externally, and I can <lb />
					say with the Deciples, I have lacked nothing, have <lb />
					been rich in the midst of poverty, here I desire <lb />
					to give my due thanks to My dear Bretheren &amp;

			<p>
					and S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, and particularly those of My own Choir <lb />
					for their love kindness &amp; patience towards me. <lb />
					But ah! how much is due to by dearest &amp; best <lb />
					Friend &amp; lover, for his Election of grace &amp; for the <lb />
					knowledge of his dear Wounded Person, his precious <lb />
					blood, and all what he is to me, I conclude with <lb />
					the 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> verse of the 43<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Chapter of Eccleasiastious <lb />
					which well express my mind, When You Glorify the <lb />
					Lord, exalt him as much as God can; for even Yet <lb />
					will he far exceed; and when You exalt him, put forth <lb />
					all Your Strength, and be not weary, for You can <lb />
					never go for enough. Thus far our late Sisters account. <lb />
					Having serv&apos;d the Single Sisters Choirs with great <lb />
					faithfulness, and blessing in several Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi> (had the <lb />
					confidence of her Sisters who always found in her a kind <lb />
					and Sympathizing friend ready to share with them in <lb />
					joy &amp; smart, the prosperity of every One laying very <lb />
					near her heart) till her bodily infirmities wou&apos;d no <lb />
					longer permit her to do what her heart &amp; mind was <lb />
					Still willing for June 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1782 She arrived here <lb />
					in Fulneck to injoy a Sabath. During the 8 years <lb />
					of her abode here, She often express&apos;d her gratitude <lb />
					to our Saviour for his kind leadings of her through <lb />
					this Vale of tears and that she had the favour to <lb />
					enjoy her time of rest in this dear Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. She had the <lb />
					love and respect of ev&apos;ry one that knew her we can with <lb />
					truth give her this testimony that She approved
						<note type="catchword">herself</note>
			</p>
			<p>
					herself among us as a real Child of peace.</p>
					<p>
					At our last Choir Festival She was present at all <lb />
					the meetings, which was the last time she was able <lb />
					to go out after which She lost her strength very <lb />
					perceptably but her longing to be at home with her <lb />
					dearst Lord encreased daily, two days before her <lb />
					happy departure She said a S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> that was with <lb />
					her with great emotion of heart, I go to our Saviour <lb />
					as the greatest Sinner, not one so great as I am, <lb />
					but this I can tell You, He has pardon&apos;d all my <lb />
					transgressions &amp; clothed me in the robe of his <lb />
					righteousness, on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May at 11 oClock <lb />
					in the forenoon She desir&apos;d to be helped up I see she said <lb />
					our Saviour he to here, now he will soon fetch me, <lb />
					after which she lay mostly Still, till 7 oClock <lb />
					in the Evening when the long wish&apos;d for moment <lb />
					came, that She departed softly &amp; happily into the  <lb />
					joy of her Lord with the blessing of her Choir <lb />
					in the 76<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year of her Age.
