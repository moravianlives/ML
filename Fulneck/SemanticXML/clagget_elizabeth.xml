							This is a memoir of
							S S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Elizt Claggett.
						</p>
					<p>
							She has left in her Choir house a good odour behind her,
							so that those who were acquainted with <del>her</del>, and had an
							opportunity to converse with her, will always retain a
							blessed remembrance of the grace which our dear
							Lord had bestowed upon her.
						</p>
					<p>
							Tho&apos; she has not, for some time past, frequent<hi rend="superscript">ed</hi> the meetings
							on acct of her disorder, yet it was remarkable that she
							always had a feeling &amp; partook <add place="above">of</add> those blessings which
							were enjoyed by the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> or her Choir, and would speak
							of it to the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> as if she had been in the meeting.
						</p>
					<p>
							Some <del>short</del> time before her dissolution, her peculiar
							disposition, namely a shyness to see or speak w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> any but
							a few particular friends, went to an extreme, but
							this served to her greater humiliation, and she became
							so loving, that she could not sufficiently express her
							gratitude, love &amp; thankfulness to all about her,
							often repeating: I love &amp; think you, I love &amp; thank
							you all. and desired often those who came to her to
							kiss her. It was a great pleasure to be with her in
							her last days, the Serenity &amp; happiness of her heart, not
							withstanding her great pains, made her sick room
							pleasant, tho her disorder would else have been very
							disagreeable to the outw<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> senses of those who came into
							the room. At last, her long &amp; ardent wish to be dissolved
							and with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> came happily to pass on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							Inst; with a sensible feeling of her Bridegroom&apos;s
							Nearess, &amp; w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the blessd of her Choir in the 52<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Yr of
							her age.

							I was born in Yorkshire in the year 1715 where I staid with my
							Mothers Relations till the year 20 in which my Mother came &amp; fetch&apos;d me
							to London. I remember to have head some Influences of Grace even in my
							Infant years, but when I was about 14 Years of age, I came under strong
							Convictions. in the rights I was sometimes so terrified, that I thought I
							realy heard the Trumpet give the Signal of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> coming to Judgment.
							I believed I shou&apos;d be in the Number of those who would call on the Rocks
							&amp; mountains to cover them. I made repeated Resolutions of devoting my future life if God shou&apos;d spare me a little longer, to his Service. I began to be
							pretty diligent in Prayer, both publick &amp; private, &amp; in the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year of my Age
							having now read in Invitation from one of my Aunts in Yorkshire a religious woman, to go &amp; stay some Time with her; having first intreated the Lord
							with many Tears, that he wou&apos;d direct this affair, I ask&apos;d &amp; obtaind leave of
							my Father &amp; Mother to go. She encouraged &amp; instructed me as will as she
							could, which I prosicuted in my way, but was never satisfied. when I
							was 17 years old, I went to the Sacrament in the Church of England, for the
							first Time. I was near 19 years old when I returnd back to London, where
							I still continued a kind of religious course, but the Gayeties and Divertions of
							the Town, strongly took hold of my Heart, till in my 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> year, when I got such
							a sense of the total Depravity of my nature, that I believ&apos;d the very marrow of
							my Bones was <add place="above">infected</add> with sin. I had never heard of any ones being awakend
							nor did I know there was such a Thing; so I concluded there was not another
							such vile wretch existing as my self. I got various Books of Devotion
							but cou&apos;d not use any of them; so I concluded they were not calculated for
							such a Creature as I. I then betook myself to David&apos;s Psalms, &amp; from thence
							collected sentences &amp; to Compild Prayers which express&apos;d the Language of my
							Heart. I often fell prostrate on the Floor &amp; with Floods of Tears, lamented
							my wretched state; some-Times I had a Glimmering of hope; these words often
							aleviated my distress &quot;perfect Love casts out Fear, for Fear hath Torment, to which my heart answerd &quot;Yes Lord, that Fear hath Torment I know
							very well, if there be a Love which casts it out, bestow it upon me.
							another Text also was much in my mind; Except ye eat the Flesh of the
							Son of man &amp; drink his blood ye have no Life in you: to which my Heart
							replied &quot;where shall I get this Blood? Why in the Sacrament, but that I dare
							not partake of lest I eat &amp; drink my own Damnation. (I had intirely left
							off going to the Sacrament, since I came to a sense of my Sinful Nature).
							One Day meditating about that Blood, I resolved on a Saints day to go to
							St Lawrances Church, &amp; by when I come there if I cou&apos;d venture to go to the
							Sacrament, I chose that Place rather than my own Parish Church, for my Friends
							&amp; acquaintance already thought I was out of my Senses, so I concealed every Thing
							which had the appearance of Religion as much as I could. accordingly I went to
							the above mentioned Church: after the first Service I remained dubious whether
							I shou&apos;d stay the Sacrament or not; I then opend my common Prayer Book on
							these Words of the Psalms, &quot;unto the wicked faith God, why dost thou teach
							my Laws or take my Covenant into thy mouth. with this I was quite stund &amp;
							thus I went directly <del>out of the Church</del> home, &amp; then to my chamber, where I
							fell prostrate, &amp; silently pourd forth Streams of Tears. I went on in a
							disconsolate Solitary way conversing but little with any one; at length I contracted some acquaintance with an old women who was a Presbyterian
							She some-Times spoke words of Consolation to me, tho&apos; I afterwards believ&apos;d
							she herself did not understand them. In my 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> year, during the Passion Week

							week I enjoid a particular serenity of mind. being wearied of my own strive
							ings, &amp; finding my last Resolutions to be but vain; I steid my self in some measure upon Grace &amp; Mercy, hopeing it might extend even to me. in this week
							I visited that Woman, I told for of my desire to go to the Sacrament, &amp; also
							related my Scruples, the encouraged me to venture, saying I shou&apos;d thereby
							get strength &amp; nourishment to pursue my future course. I thought tho&apos;
							our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>would not accept of me before, perhaps he will now; so I concluded that if the same stillness &amp; compoture of mind, I then enjoyd
							continued till Sunday I would venture: it continued, &amp; on Easter Sunday I
							arose in a calm bowedness of Heart, &amp; went to the early Sacrament
							which was kept at my own Parish Church. At receiving of the Bread &amp; 
							Wine, an awe seized one, so that my Hand trembled greatly, which caused
							the Minnister to stare <del>at stare</del> at me, but the Love, Peace &amp; Joy which
							in those moments took Possession of my Soul, words cannot express.
							I return&apos;d home so chearful lightsome &amp; happy, that it seem&apos;d to me as
							if I went on Wings. being come Home I met with many Things not very agreable, but so passionate as I used to be before, now nothing disturbed me;
							I loved every Body to exceedingly that <add place="above">I thought</add> I could have laid down &amp; let them
							tread upon one. I long&apos;d to be again at Church out of the Sight &amp; hearing of
							Earthly Things, to thither I went again at 10 O&apos;Clock, my Heart was in such a
							desolveing condition that the Tears would now &amp; then Start out of my Eyes, which
							the People observing, told my Relations that now I was indeed gone out of
							my senses for I had Wept at Church; which oblig&apos;d me to get a retired Seat
							among ordinary Old People. In the Nights my Heart would be singing Hosan
							as &amp; Hallelujahs, for I knew not right what to sing or say, nor what had happen&apos;d to me; other Things as well as my self seemd alterd, &amp; the Scriptures
							as if I had never read them before, but for all this I had Times of Heaviness, &amp; if my Feeling was long withdrawn, even of doubting of my Sal
							vation. soon after this a poor Woman <add place="above">coming</add>
								<del>came</del> to my Fathers House to begg
							some relief for her Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> who was ill of a Cancer in her Breast, I had a desire
							to visit the Sick Person, &amp; accordingly went to her Lodging, there I for the first
							time saw Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hutton who was then in his Apprenticeship, &amp; thro&apos; his means I
							become acqainted with Whitefield Wesleys &amp; others of the Methodists, among
							whom I continued till in the year 1740 when the Bre<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> began their Labour
							in England. I knew directly that they were the People for me, since which
							Time I adhered to them entirely. in June 1742 I went with great Reluctance
							but in compliance with my Fathers commands to spend the Summer with
							the rest of our Family at Broadoaks in Essex, I had been there 2 or 3
							Weeks when as Sitting alone in my Room, our Savr presented himself to
							my Heart in his bleeding Wounded Form, &amp; brought me into such a converse
							with his own dear person, as I had never known before, then it was that
							my heart went over to Him, then I was willing to live any where, or be any
							Thing what might be most pleasing to him. His Blood his Death &amp; Almighty Atonement has since that blest Intercouse, remaind my neverfailing
							Source of Comfort &amp; Consolation, in all Trials &amp; Vicissitudes whatsoever.
							his Wounds &amp; bitter Passion, his Death was my confession, &amp; shall be
							till my Eye-Strings break. The Bre<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> rejoied much at my return to
							London at all the Grace our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had bestowed on me. In June 1742
							my Father having departed this Life, I went by the Direction of the
						
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>
						
							Bre<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> to the Childrens Oeconomy in Lambs-Inn, where I
							lived with the bigger Girls. Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I returnd to London, &amp; on the
							30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of the some Instant, that ever memorable day, I was present at the
							settling of the London Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>: what we felt at that time I suppose will by
							no Body be forgot who was there till beyond the Grave, I thought, this is
							none other but the House of God, &amp; here are the Gates of Heaven! There
							I got my incontestable Call, to be visibly united to that Body. on
							the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> day next following, I was rec&apos;d (viz) on Christmass Day 
							1743, &amp; had the Favour of being admitted to the <del>Sacrament</del> next follow
							ing Sacrament, which I think to have been Jan. 1743.
						</p>
					<p>
							I assisted in the Labour amongst the Single Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in London according
							to my Small abillity till June 1743 where I was sent by the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> into
							Yorkshire, to have the joint Care of the Single Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Choir there with
							my Sister Susanna &amp; Sister Lloid. In June 1744 I was blest for the
							Office of Vorestehr of the said Choir, &amp; in Aug<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> following, I rec&apos;d the
							blessing for the office I afterwards held amongst the Single Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, during
							every anointed Prayer of Bror Martin Dobers. In that situation I continued
							till my state of health render&apos;d me incapable of serving my dear Sisters
							as I had hithertoo done; I then sent my Petitions to dear Mammagen
							&amp; Anna Johanna to send a Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> from Germany to supply my Place
							which was at length granted in the year 1748 to the entire satisfaction of my Heart. I laid down my Office at our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Feet with
							more Inclination than I had at first to receive it, <add place="above">being now more unable to fulfill it</add> yet awefully conciding how he might have look&apos;d upon my poor services; and if his
							Heart cou&apos;d upon the whole be satisfied with them? His friendly Counte
							nance cheard me, I begd his absolation for all my Faults Failings,
							&amp; Mistakes, &amp; thus with a throughly comforted &amp; contented Heart I
							enterd into my wish&apos;d for Sabbatick State, I was desirious to go to
							the then now settled Oeconomy at little-moor, hopeing a charge of air
							might be of Service to me where I continued near a year, &amp; realy
							did grow a little better, having rec&apos;d a Letter from my dear Mammagen
							(who was not quite satisfied with my betakeing any self wholy to sick
							ness &amp; Retirement) wherein she mentiond in the most loving &amp; kind
							manner, that she shou&apos;d like to have me go to Duckenfield &amp; do what
							I could amongst the Single Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> there: I laid the matter before our
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, &amp; found that notwithstanding the seeming Impossibillity of my
							performing the Journey, my heart was never easey, but when I thought
							of going: thus I came to a Resolution, &amp; having had a blessed Journey
							I arrived there May 1749: from whence I return&apos;d with the whole
							Oeconomy of Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1750. The Bre<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> favour&apos;d
								me
							with one of the Houses on Lambs-Hill, where I lived
							chearful &amp; contented only in an exceeding poor state of Health
							till Feb<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1753 when I come into the dear Choir-House.
