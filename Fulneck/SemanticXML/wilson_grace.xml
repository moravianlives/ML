					<p> Grace Willsons was born Ap: 1 1737 at Wortley in the parish of Leeds. My parents belong&apos;d the church of Eng: but frequenting the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Meetings,
						they took us Children very <add place="above">much</add> often with them, My Mother would often Speak with me concerning how I might love Our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						but I had no understanding of it yet I felt my self much pleased &amp; my Ears attentively Open to all which I heard the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> Speak who kept the
						meetings, &amp; was particularly awe&apos;d and restraind from Many Childest &amp; selfways, thro&apos; a real fear of Griveing our dear Saviour, who had Suffer&apos;d much out
						of Love to Me. when disobedience over took me it made My mind uneasey &amp; I often went alone to weep, with real Longing to become acquainted with him whom I thus offended </p>
					<p> B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Helt as Children parent often kept their Meetings And when he Spoak of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> blood &amp; wounds, my Heart fill<hi
							rend="superscript">d</hi> presantly with Love &amp; tenderness, so that it was a most pleaseing Subject to me, &amp; particularly at one meeting, in which B<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi> Helt asked The Children Many Questions, concerning our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> wounds, &amp; which was The greatest &amp; what it was
						that pirced our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Side, also what flowed from this Larg wound Hole a particular impression moved my heart, to answer all these Questions, &amp;
						when I name&apos;d that blood &amp; water flowed out of His Side, I Then was overpowere&apos;d </p>

					<p> with such a peculiar feeling &amp; that most Lovely form with all His wounds &amp; bruises, stood before me, Now it was quite Clear to me, what had attacked my Heart &amp;
						drawn me impreceptably thro&apos; my Childrens years, Thus in His dear nearness I went happily on And in My 14 year, I was taken into the Gr Girls Choir, which was a grace
						&amp; blessing to me; But in some small time after I came into doubting over my self Whether I Stood in a right connection with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> for I
						became quite Miserable, all at once, &amp; feeling my Corrupted Nature, made me disspair of Our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ever havering ought to do with me again, Thus I
						went on believeing ev&apos;ry body happier then myself, frequently I beg&apos;d &amp; pray&apos;d my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to forgive me all the wretched
						ness &amp; Sin which I felt in me, &amp; make me once again is happy &amp; his Cherefull Child, at Times I felt some comfort but then again it was with Drawn, yet many a Time
						Those words was closely impressd on my mind, <hi rend="underline">Thou</hi>
						<hi rend="underline">Shall be mine</hi> not withstanding my unbeleive prevaild, &amp; this disponding Situation, I kept much too myself, at Last I resolved to Speak about it to
						my Laboures, who told me just such poor Creatures our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<add place="above">wanted</add> who cou&apos;d not help themselves, so that His Grace alone might be the only remidy for their happiness, </p>
					<p> This was such a Comfort to my Heart as words cannot Express </p>
					<cb />
					<p> yet I found my unbeleive remaining with <hi rend="underline">Me</hi> &amp; made me doubtfull over evry comfort </p>
					<p> Being Once in the preaching I heard the Sin of unbeleive particularly Expleind, &amp; that all our Missery was, the Effects of that great Sin: Here it was, as if Something
						Spoak loudly in my Ear, &amp; told me, <hi rend="underline">That very</hi>
						<hi rend="underline">Sin keeps Thee from being happy</hi>; I Directly beleived it to be true, &amp; found my Heart was opening towards our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>,
						Instantly I begd &amp; pray&apos;d that he wou&apos;d take a way my unbeleive, &amp; give me a full assurance of his rich forgiveness, here my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi> vouch safe to grant The poor petitions of a destressed Heart, feeling what Smart &amp; pain I,d cost Him, bowed me in the very dust, I can never Express how this
						Sight &amp; feeling of my beloved has attended <add place="above">me</add> with abiding grace, Thro&apos; the future moments of my Life? Thus I spent my time in the Gr Girls
						Choir, as his unworthy Child, relying on his merits and forgiveness as his poor but favour&apos;d <add place="above">sinner</add> parting daily to be more &amp; more to His
						Hearts Joy, &amp; familiarly conversation with his dear &amp; wounded person? I still live&apos;d with my parents till my 20 year with Longings in my heart to be a Member of
						the congreg= in the year -57 I went to live in the occonomie at Gomersal, to my great Joy &amp; blessing for my heart; this proved a necessary schooling for me, &amp; in the
						Same year May 4 I was taken into the Single Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Choir; The blessings of this festival Day will ever be precious to me I laid myself before My
						Hearts best Ferind </p>
