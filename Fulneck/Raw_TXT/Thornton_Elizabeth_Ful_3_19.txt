The course of Life of the S S Eliz Thornton who went happily from Sav. Feby 18 1770
I was born in the parish of Anchett Yorkshire octobr 12, 1727 baptzd in the
Church of England, my father departed out of Time when
I was four years old; my mother became much concern'd for Her
own salvation & also that of her children, & when Mr Ingham
& Mr dalamott preachd in those parts where we lived, my mother
went constantly to hear them & wou'd gladly have had me have gone
along with Her, but contary to the conviction of my own Heart
I restraind myself, & often felt myself severly condem'd for so doing,
about my 14 year my mother departed this Life in full Relyance
of our Savrs death & sufferings, this still had no immediate effect
upon me; but one day some little Time after as I was going to the
well for water, I was struck in my Mind all at once; how often I had
resisted my dear mother's impertuning me to go with Her unto the meetings
& now in my Lost & wretched condition I had no one to advice with or Speak
the Least Sentement of my Hearts situation to; in this Misarable condition
of my Mind, I set me down by the well like one distracted, till my sister
came to seek me; she was much frighthen'd, thought I had lost my sences,
ask'd whats the matter, I told Her I was much concern'd about my Souls
Salvation & that I cou'd not bear it any longer, she told me I was much
too young to be concern'd on any such Occasion, but I yet found no rest
but went the same day to speak with Br Ockerthousen who lived at
mirfield; after some Questions relative to my concern'd situation & if I
frequented the preaching of the Brns to which such questions I answerd
that I had not yet been but wou'd be glad to go if my Sister whom I lived
with would give me leave; Bn Ockerthousen spoke very comfortable and
incurraging to me & said He wou'd come to see me & speak with my Sister.
On that occasion, which He also did, & my Sister let me go for a few Times
to the preaching, but fearing I shoud come into a further connection
which she did not like, therefore proposed my going to service that I might
be otherways ingaged then spend my Time in running to the Meetings,
Br Ockerthousen Hereing my sisters intentions with me sent for me, & as He was
going from home I give Him my word in promise that I wou'd not
be proswaded by my sister! But in a few days I broke my promise & went
to service, which proved on most occasions very agreeable to me, but this
Breach of promise condem'd me. Night & day & I had no rest till,


till I went to Br Ockerthousen to confess my great unfaithfulneess, He
as a Tender father forgave me & advis'd to better conduct for the future, promis'd
to help me to a place more suitable & proper for me, & about my 17 year
I went to live with a Single woman in Hightown, but the want of Grace &
knowledge of our Savr in My heart which was not intirely devoted to live to Him
& the Hankering after the world Occasiond me Many restless night & days
for near a twelf month; tho I coud perceive my dear Savr had a Gracious
hand upon me till necessities of my Heart wou'd open to Him, thus
I went on in this wavering yet reserved manner, & being at the preaching
heard the Br say that afford Soul be saved but simply that our dr Savr had
sufferd death & made attonement for His sins, He cou'd be as Happy from
that Moment as if He waited 10 years; this made such an impression on me
that I cou'd scarcely stand or go, believ'd I cou'd not live many Minutes
Longer without My Savr Manifested Himself to me, in this condition I hastend into
a field praying in a Most fervant manner desiring to deliver Soul & body
intirely up to Him! & it was as if He stood bodily present with me & forgave
me all my Sins, this was such a day of Grace & Salvation unto me as
made me Quite such an altered person as I never felt in all my Life before, I
begun to sing those five dear wounds torn wide for me &, which was
repeatedly continued till I reached my home & my heart was fill with bowedness
& shame, some time after I removed to live at the Oeconomes of Clackheaton &
had now & then some little fears about my coming thro' but was became chereful
& thankful for my Happy Happy lot of grace, then to my Grife I was removed
to the Holm Oeconomie but soon become at Home & satisfied, Yet as all the Sisters
became received into the Cogn but me I came into deep thoughts over my backward situation
& the Holy Ghost enterd into a deep Schooling by showing me the great depravity
of my Heart, the Sight of which Occasion'd me to think I surely was not so good
nor so fitt to be Reciv'd feeling sin & misery still lay heavy in me! brought me into great
dejection in my mind for 3 or four months, but on Janr 1st 1750 I had the
unspeakable grace to be received into the congregation this proved unabiding
Consolation to my heart, & in the same year I had the unexpected favour to
become a participant of His Holy Corpses & blood to my great Joy & deep abasement
the dear Holy Ghost in defatigable Labour in My heart was to bring me to be
a Sinner about my own deprevity & to get a more confident reliance on my
Savr & his merits then my own but alass I was very Timerous in my own
self righteousness struck very close unto me;
in My removal to the Town Occonomie I became very sickly, which occasion'd
my outward coming thro' to prove a little heavy, but the Sister Love &


behaviour to me shall never more forget Especially Ann Birkby who was
particularly Tender to me dureing my whole ilness as she had the Care of
the Occonomie at that Time.
In the year 52 I was in the number of those Sisters that had the Grace
to be first inhabbitants of the Choir house at fulneck in which dr place
I did not always spend my Time to the Mutual blessing of my Heart & those
dr Sisters whom I lived & workd with, my Criticizing Spirit lookd more
at there faults then my own, about which it was dificult for me to be
a Sinner, not withstanding this ??? & mercy more, that my Sisters 
know not of; The dear Holy Ghost Labourd incessantly on my heart to become
Sanctified in Soul & body thro' a personal connection with my bleeding Bridegroom
the injoyment of this Special Grace made all my choir Opportunities a
daily Litugy to my Heart & what Ive enjoy'd in my dear Choirhouse
will in all ????ness be Eternaly Chanted by me with thankfulness & praise
in the year 64 I remov'd to serve the Children in the Occonomie, in
which place I had many things Learn! this together with my ????
disposition not likeing to have my great dificiencies Exposed, caused myself
& others some unEasyness, but as I knew where peace abounded, I humbled my
self at my Savrs feet & submitted to be His poor & needy one & become mine
chereful & happy in my Heart;
in the year 65 I had the Grace to come amongst the intersessors, it was
a real means to let me see more & more that nothing but a needy Sinner heart
cou'd come into His presence, my great unfitness on all Ocassion Humble'd me
many Times down to my Savrs Feet & the viability I felt in Serving of the
Children Melted me into Love & Heartiness towards them & made My course
more Easey & chereful in there midst; thus far Her own dictateing 
about Last Novbr our happily departed Sr begun Her illness with a bad Cough
& pain in all Her Limbs all possible means & Medicins was used to very little Effect.
she got a Secret impression that this ilness wou'd be the Means of Her dissolution
but Timerous to Mention it least it shou'd not be as she Expected.
Her dissorder increasing accompanied with voilent pains in the Midst of
which She with great cherefulness Express'd Her Eager longeing to be with our
dear Savr, her great bodily Suffering she bore with Such patience that Her
conversation & resignation was ablessed Edification to all around Her. &
said indeed one cannot tell what our Savr is to a poor needy Sinner, till one
has done with every thing around one; Saying I have now no leave to look
Either to the right hand or to the Left & I have but a few moment to wait
before He removes the veil & presents himself as my only object, which I am to be


more fuly Occupied withall, The Sensibility of her great poverty she Expressed
in a perkewlier manner to Her Laboures at Speaking before the Holy Communion
& that our dr Savr had lead Her to the Sinner point in a most Loveing & tender
manner & often said He is Certainly more, ye much more then a Savr to my Soul
for He Loves me beyond Expression! indeed I would not be without those pains
& sickness for ever so much, Oh the Heavenly Communon which I His poor
betty now injoys with Christ my Lord. none can conceive what it is to have
such a vissiable intercourse with a Savr till they come into such a Situation as Im at
present in, He is already come'd & calld me by my name & when nothing interveans
I see Him bodily present by my bed, then all wants & pains vanishes at once
& I can feel as if I was already gone. therefore this woud not do for
you My Sisters, that has the dear Childen for to look after;
the Last Time she partook of the Holy Sacrament, she felt refresd in a
particular blessd manner; & said ah my self righteousness ah what a
despicable figure it now appears in to me, His poor Sinner;
Her Love to the Children move'd a desire to see them took a most Tender leave
of Each & Expressed her sincere wish for there prosperity, reccommended them
to the Childrens friend & like a Tender mother wishd to meet them all with
our dear Savr, this affecting Sight caused such a Tender Emotion on both sides
as nothing but there Tears cou'd and ever Express
a few days before for departure Her whole heart & mind was so taken up
with our dear Savr that Her Countenance & words was accompanied with
such a Sinnerlike Joyful Expectation of soon seeing Him face to face that her
very Soul was delighted with imaginations, that the whole place
could not but here the great Sound of musick for now He was come & on the
morning of the 8 she in a rapture said ah He is come to fetch me fore
you well my Sisters fare you well for now I go. These was the last
words she spoke, & about nine a Clock Her Happy Soul took flight
into her Bridegrooms arms dureing the blessing of Her Choir
in the 42 year of her age.
