					The S. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mary Gladhill who happily
					departed this life Dec 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1809, has
					left the following few lines concerning
					herself. July 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1727.</p>
					<p>
					I was born at Belly Bridge near Wyke
					and baptized in the Church of England
					from my earliest years I remember my
					Mother taking me to hear Mr Ingham
					preach, &amp; I felt at that time, some 
					thing of our Saviours nearness, which
					I however did not fully understand 
					besides my natural inclination being
					after the world. In my 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
					year our whole family was afflicted
					with a bad fever, of which we all 
					got better accept my Mother who
					dyed on it, we was now left in 
					deplorable circumstances, I being the
					oldest of the Children; the towns
					people would give me no assistance, 
					I had learned nothing to earn a lifely,
					hood, and was now obliged to go from 
					door to door to beg my Bread, I 
					met with many Kind Benefactors

					who pittied me in my distress; after
					sometime I went into service, from
					one place to another, I found it very
					hard &amp; met with many troubles; having
					no body to tell my concern to, nor
					to care for me, I prayed to the
					Lord to help me, about this time
					I became aquanited with the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
					Eliz<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; Sarah Holdsworth, and went
					to live with them; they often spoke
					to me about our Saviour, and I felt their 
					concern &amp; good wishes for me, but <add place="above">had</add> no
					inclination to attend to it. I spent
					several years, in a very uneasy situation
					of mind, during this time I heart 
					Mr Eastwood preach on that text
					of the ten Virgins, which had a par 
					ticular effect upon my heart, for it 
					was clear to me I was in the Class
					of the foolish virgins, I wept before
					our Saviour &amp; prayed him to have mercy
					upon me, &amp; to forgive me all my
					sins, I felt on this occation some, 
					thing which I can not express,
				
			</p>
						<pb/>
			<p>
				
					Our Saviour showed me his loving &amp;
					forgiving heart, and I felt that he
					had suffered, bled &amp; died for me.
					Being of an unsteady turn of mind I
					soon came into things again which was
					contrary to our Saviours will, an which
					account I spent many heavy hours
					but he always approved himself 
					as my best friend, and took notice
					of me the poorest among the needy.
					<add place="above">Being now </add> undetermined
					whether to make application to belong
					to the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> or to be a follower
					of Mr Eastwood, I prayed to our Savr 
					to make it clear to me, which way to 
					turn, and he convinced me the Brn
					where the people to whom I should
					belong. Upon this I made application 
					and obtained leave to come and
					live in the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> House at Gumersal,
					this favour was granted to me Oct
					10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1760. for which I often thank
					our Saviour with my whole heart
					Thus far her own Account.

					Our late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> was soon at home amongst
					us, and thankful for her Lot. 
					Apr. 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1765 she was rec&apos;d into the
					Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; Apr. 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the following
					year, she partook for the first
					time of the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. After living
					10 years in Gumersal she moved in
					1770 to Fulnek, into the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> House
					here, where she spent the remainder
					of her days, &amp; tho she in that long
					period, met with many trials, both
					internal &amp; external, yet her simple
					reliance &amp; confidence in the Lord
					helped her thro in every case. 
					She often used to say: &quot;Our Saviour
					and every body is very good to me
					I can never be thankfull enough,
					if I could only cleave closer to 
					him, but he allways tells me, I am
					his, &amp; He will keep me to the end.
					It can truly be said, Her happy lot
					to know our Saviour &amp; herself and to 
					live in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> was highly vallued
					by her. She was contendt &amp; chearful

					in poverty &amp; thankful for every good
					gift imparted to her, and injoyed the
					the Love &amp; good will of every one.
					In general she was blessed with good 
					health, even in her old age, which also 
					was a matter of great thankfulness to 
					her. About two weeks before her 
					departure she was seriously attaked
					with sickness &amp; womiting, but she thought
					herself better again, &amp; Nov. 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> she 
					injoyed the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> in fellowship
					with the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, finding herself still
					very weak &amp; her Cough growing trouble
					some, she submitted on the 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to 
					go into the Sikroom, on Dec. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> being
					asked in the morning. how she felt, 
					she said; <lg>
						<l>&quot;Very well, I have no pain</l>
					<l>&quot; &amp; do not think I am going yet to</l> 
					<l>&quot;our Saviour, but if it be his will</l>
					<l>&quot;to take me to himself, I am not </l>
					<l>&quot;only resigned, but shall be happy</l>
					<l>&quot;to be with him whom I love above</l>
					<l>all.&quot; </l>
