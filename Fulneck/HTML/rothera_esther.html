      <p> Departed <em>June 2<sup>d</sup> 1761</em><br /> Personalia of our dear Sister<a href="#mlper000572.html">Esther Rothera</a> in <br /><a href=".html">Hallifax</a>. </p>
      <p> Our happily deceased Sister, was Daughter to <a href=".html">M<sup>r</sup> James <br /> Farrer</a> in <a href="#mlpla000373.html">Soyland, in the Parish of Hallifax</a> where she <br /> was
         born <em>Febr 2<sup>d</sup> 1706 O.S</em>. and brought up in the <br /> principles of the Church of England in a carefull and <br /> religious manner. </p>
      <p> The following <sup>is her own</sup> account (of her was noted down by her <br /><a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Joshua Metcalf</a> from her own mouth:) </p>
      <p> "When I was <em>8 Years old</em>, I can remember, that I was <br />weary about the Salvation of my Soul. I felt the <br /> drawings of my Saviour in my heart (and thought <br /> the Lord
         meant to shew me something more than <br /> the rest of my B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; S<sup>rs</sup> or even any of my kindred). <br /><em>About the Age of 13<sup>th</sup></em> I was made more
         sensible of <br /> the Corruption of my nature and convinced that I <br /> was not right, but how to find Restfor my heart<br /> I knew not. My guilty conscience made me evry <br /> where
         afraid. I often thought the grand Enemy of <br /> Souls was in the room with me, and was so frighted<br /> that I would not sleep alone in a room so that <br /> they were obliged to take me
         into that of my Father <br /> and Mother. My Father departed this Life soon <br /> after, and When <em>I was 15 Years old</em> I was turnd <br /> into the World to earn my own Bread. My Mo-
         <br /> ther would not let me live in a publik Town, <br /> she had a concern for my Soul, and thought it <br /> was too dangerous for young people. I went <br /> therefore to live with a
         Widow Woman in the Country <br /> and stayd with her near 2 Years. One of my <br /> Sisters sent afterwards for me and desired me <br /> to come and live with her, which I did. Ha-

      <p> Having been with her some Years I returned and soon <br /> after went to live at <a href="#mlpla000091.html">Hallifax</a>. <del>Being now</del><sup>When I
            was</sup><em>25 <br /> Years</em> old I got a fresh Call from my dear Lord, I <br /> saw my sadwretched and dismal State, which I <br /> was in by nature, with more conviction and
         distress. <br /> I had no rest in my Soul by reason of my Sins. They <br /> increased and the depravity of nature grew <br /> stronger &amp; stronger. I made one promise after the <br />
         other, took one resolution after the other to leave off doing <br /> Evil and to mend my manner of Life, but all to no <br /> purpose. My good will came to nought. Alas! I had no <br /> power
         in myself, Nature ruled, Sin was my Master, <br /> and I was a perfect Slave. </p>
      <p> In my <em>27<sup>th</sup> Year</em> I changed my condition &amp; was married <br /> to my husband <a href=".html">Crispin Rothera</a>. I hoped thereby to be <br /> delivered out of dangers,
         and <del>that</del> to become more religious <br /> But this availed nothing neither, I was conscious that I <br /> was not in a State of heart that could please<a href=".html">God</a>. My
         <br /> poor Soul had no rest. I often knew not what to do for <br />trouble of mind and Anxietyof heart. Certainly, thought <br /> I, there is no rest and Comfort to be found in any state
         <br /> whatsoever, that I can see into, as yet. O thought I, <br /> what a dismalcondemned Situation am I in, having <br /> no restin my heart by day <del>n</del>or night. I went con- <br />
         stantly to Church, and Prayers, read religious books &amp; <br /> did all I could, but remained the same, as I was. At Length I got to hear, that a new Preacher, One</p>
      <p><a href="#mlper000536.html">M<sup>r</sup> Ingham</a>, was to come to <a href="#mlpla000091.html">Hallifax</a> &amp; <del>to</del> preach in <br /> the Church. Him I went to hear, his
         preaching confir- <br /> med me in my thoughts, that I was in a lost and un- <br /> done Condition, which he set forth as I found it in <br /> my own heart. I went home full of uneasiness of
         mind, <br /> and condemned in heart, retired into a place by myself <br /></p>

      <p> fell down upon my knees in order to pray, but <br /> could do nothing but Sigh. My heart was quite
         broken, <br /> and I wept abundance of tears. How I felt then I <br /> cannot express in Words. I got some comfort and <br />hoped it would go better. But I found however no <br /> abiding
         rest and Satisfactionfor my heart.</p>
      <p> A little time after I got to hear that some Germans or as <br /> others called them Moravian Brethren came to preach in <br /><a href="#mlpla000091.html">Hallifax</a>. They brought us the
         sweet &amp; comfortable Tidings <br /> of the Salvation of Sinners thro' the Sufferings &amp; Death <br /> of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>, inviting the poor and miserable to come just <br /> as
         they were to their wounded Sav<sup>r</sup> and seek for <br />Grace at his feet, <sup>declaring that</sup> he had redeemed us and would freely <br /> save us from Sin, &amp; give rest to our
         Souls.</p>
      <p> Their Words came with power to my heart, I rejoiced<br /> at this good News, and got hopes that he would have <br />Mercy on me poor miserable Sinner. I frequented <br /> their Meetings as
         often as my poor State of health <br /> would permit. When I went the very first time <br /> to <a href="#mlpla000065.html">Smithhouse</a> to a Meeting there (and came on the <br /> Bank
         Top,) I was thrown <sup>from</sup><del>by</del> the horse. I thought <br /> within myself, this is the Enemys Doing, to keep me <br /> back and to hinder me from going. I went however <br />
         forward, (and desired those that were with me, not <br /> to tell my husband or others of it, lest he should <br /> hinder me to go again.) I was a quarter of a Year <br /> sick afterwards.
         The more I heard the B<sup>rn</sup> the more <br /> I saw the deep Corruption of my heart, being of a <br />proud, passionatetemper, and inclined to be selfrightious. I resolved to be our
         Saviours with Soul &amp; <br /> body, and parted with whatsoever I thought would <br /> prove a hindrance to my happiness, and step in <br /> betwixt me and our Sav<sup>r</sup>. I used to
         spin worsted <br /> and had saved the bits of Ends now &amp; then to <br /> make in time a pair of Stockings out of them </p>

      <p> This I looked upon as an Injustice by
            w<sup>ch</sup> I had wronged <br /> the Master. It caused me much Uneasiness. I could not <br /> be satisfied, till I had confessed it to the Owner and made <br />Satisfaction. He looked
         upon it as an instance of great <br /> honesty and had ever after a great respect for me.</p>
      <p> I thought, whosoever will be reconciled unto <a href=".html">God</a>, must also re- <br /> ctify all unjust things between Man &amp; Man. </p>
      <p><a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Ockerhousen</a> came afterwards to keep Meetings at <br /><a href="#mlpla000091.html">Hallifax</a>, which I attended with blessingfor my heart, beg <br /> ged to
         be under the B<sup>rn</sup> Care and in their Society, w<sup>ch</sup><br /> also was granted to my great Joy and was thankfull for it. <br /> I continued also to go to Church but seldom heard
         what my <br /> Soul longed for; and often sighed: Thou o dear <a href=".html">Jesu</a>! Shalt be <br /> my all, my Sacrifice and Priest. Thou art too strong for all <br /> my bitterest Foes.
         None can thy Blood successfully oppose."</p>
      <p> Upon her earnest request she was received into the Congregation<br /> and got her right and Title amidst the Flock &amp; house of <a href=".html">God</a><br /> and she <br /> was admitted to
         the holy Sacrament</p>
      <p> her Spirit was lively, but her tabernacle subject to many In- <br /> firmities. An Asthmatic disorder hindered her these many <br /> Years from going much abroad. But as long as she could
         <br /> creep, she seldom missed any Meetings. To read the holy <br /> Scripture was her private comfort, and she had got very <br /> much aquainted with it, and thought much abt under- <br />
         standing the same and feeling in her own heart what <br /> she read. These latter 12 months past her Infirmity grew <br /> stronger and her short breath <del>has</del> prevented her from go-
         <br /> ing as far even as to the Stanary. But during the Meeting<br /> she usually had her private Devotion to the head so <br /> full of bruises (and was very glad when any of her friends
         <br /> would tell her the Subject of the Discourse.) She loved<br /> the Congr<sup>n</sup>with all her heart, (All the scandalous reports </p>

         Grace<br /> to be a member of the same. She often said to those <br /> that reasoned ag<sup>st</sup> them or bro<sup>t</sup> all sorts of Tales to her: <br /> "The B<sup>rn</sup> will stand
         and all those that are against them will <br /> be confounded and found Lyars, for the Lord is with them <br /> She and her husband had some years ago got Leave to <br /> come and live among
         the B<sup>rn</sup> at <a href="#mlpla000048.html">Lambshill</a>, But her <br /> husband from a Scrupulosity ab<sup>t</sup> his coming thro &amp; <br /> getting his Livelyhood, declined it.
         She was often <br />grieved abt it and said: "Tho she loved her husband very <br /> much, yet that thing she could hardly forgive him.) <br /> Their house was open for the Brn at all times,
         and she <br /><del>their</del> thought it a great Blessing if they would put <br /> up with the Entertainment and reception she could <br /> give them. She was these many months in great
         <br /> pain all over, but could forget it easily when she <br /> had an opporutnity of conversing with any one abt <br /> our d<sup>r</sup>Sav<sup>r</sup> and his Wounds. Many of her
         Neighbours <br /> and acquaintances came sometimes to talk with her. <br /> They had a peculiar confidence to her and told her <br /> freely their troubles (whether outward or inward) She
         <br /> used to comfort them with the meritorious troubles<br /> and Sufferings of our blessedSav<sup>r</sup> for us (When <br /> she met with any that had fallen out, or had an <br />Enmity
            ag<sup>st</sup> each other, She would tell <del>every</del><sup>each</sup> one <br /> that it came from their bad heart, which <del>they</del><br /> at such opportunites shewd itself, that
         they might <br /> know it, and seek to our Sav<sup>r</sup> to be cured) She was <br /> one of them that endeavoured to make Peace between <br /> persons and her Counsel was often blessed
         &amp; <br /> successful. (A few days before her Dissolution she <br />desired that some persons might be called to her, be- <br /> cause she knew that they thro Reasoning had </p>

         was so weak <br /> and would only make herself uneasy, She answ: Pray, <br /> let me do it, one does not know, what the last words of a dying <br /> person may effect upon them. Her <a

      <p> One has those many years expected that she would not hold <br /> long, but her peculiar Chearfullness, patience &amp; Sinnerlikeness <br /> made them all think, that our Savr would take her
         home <br /> unto himself, and that she would not recover this time) <br /> Last good fryday after the publick Meeting, she <br /> had her Share in the holy Sacramt brought unto her by <a
            href="#mlper000328.html">B<sup>r</sup><br /> Pyrlaus</a>; she received it with great Bowedness &amp; Eagerness &amp; <br /> the Transaction was attended with an awfull and sensible <br />
         feeling of the nearness of our tormented husband. And <br /> this proved to be the last time. (When <a href="#mlper000328.html">B<sup>r</sup></a> &amp; <a href=".html"

         be <br /> here, but no matter, I shall keep it with him above, &amp; so <br /> it proved, for she went home the same <del>night</del> &amp; day <br /> before midnight.) </p>
      <p> Some months ago, when she thought that this her present Illness<br /> would be her last, she expressed constantly her Concern about <br /> her husband. O said she, nothing troubles my mind,
         but when <br /> I relfect upon my husband I am anxious. I know him <br /> best, I am in pain for him. She often with Tears begd <br /> him to cleave close to our

         is wellcome to it, <br /> he shall have me and all what I have. She catchd hold <br /> of him at the same time &amp; cried: Dont leave, dont <br /> Leave me, take me with Thee. He thereupon
         took her by <br /> one arm, threw her over his Shoulders. She clasp her <br /> arm round his neck &amp; Thought Well! new he has me <br /> I will hold him fast. And while he carried her away,
         <br /> She lookd back on her Bed to see, whether her body <br /> was gone too but she saw it behind, and thought Its <br /> no matter, I shall get it once ag<sup>n</sup>. When she awoke
         <br /> they saw she was extraordinary chearfull &amp; happy and <br /> the meditation on this dream made her forget the Pain<br /> and strengthned her wonderfully. and several other <br />
