					<lb />Was born at Northouram in the
					<lb />Parish of Halifax. My Parents being Disenters, I 
					<lb />was babtiz&apos;d according to their Profession, as my d<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>
					<lb />Mother departed this Life while I was yet very young
					<lb />my father being left with 4 Children namely one Son
					<lb />and 3 Daughters, and being strictly religous himself, took all 
					<lb />possible care to preserve us from the seductions of the
					<lb />world. this concern of His, togather with my natural thought
					<lb />full turn of mind led me to an enquirery after future
					<lb />happiness, even in my Childhood, at which time the fear of
					<lb />death restrain&apos;d me from injoying my self in the manner
					<lb />usual to others at that age, contrary to my inclination
					<lb />which was to divert my thoughts, not being able to
					<lb />Satisfy my self by those means, as I grew older I took
					<lb />the resolution to exert the utmost of my power to shake
					<lb />of my former Convictions, and I found even then that my
					<lb />best efforts prov&apos;d vain to help my indweling proponsity
					<lb />to the alurements of this world, having in private
					<lb />often besought the Lord with tears to save me, and still
					<lb />found I was as prone as ever to come into the same
					<lb />Condemration. I pursu&apos;d this resolution as far as I was
					<lb />able and acepting the invitation of others of my Companions
					<lb />strove to amuse my thoughts by publick diversions, in
					<lb />the midst of one of which asemblies, I was so amazingly
					<lb />struck with Horror &amp; Condemnation, that I was forc&apos;d to
					<lb />retire, beseeching the Lord to have Mercy upon me I
					<lb />resolv&apos;d never to come into the like ocasion again.

					<lb />which I also never did, altho still heart was unconverted
					<lb />nor had I any desire to engage in Religion, as many of
					<lb />my aquaintance would have perswaded me, by oppertunity
					<lb />of Mr Ingham&apos;s Preaching who was just then come into these
					<lb />parts, my reason was to try If I cou&apos;d find no satisfaction
					<lb />more in the world first; but finding by experience that my
					<lb />misery pursu&apos;d me more Closely then ever, I gladly made use 
					<lb />of the offer of the Gospel made by the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> at their
					<lb />first coming into Yorkshire. by whose means I found the 
					<lb />only way to seek true satisfaction, and lamented with many 
					<lb />tears my former indifference towards my d<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> who had 
					<lb />so graciously led me unknown to myself of from all other
					<lb />pleasures to seek my happiness alone in Him. The B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi>
					<lb />soon began how to Settle Bands among the Young Women
					<lb />but not having much aquaintance with me thought best
					<lb />to refer My reception into their society somtime longer.
					<lb />this Circumstance together with my ardent desire for their
					<lb />fellowship caus&apos;d me many sorrowfull reflection over
					<lb />myself for my past neglect. but as they not only
					<lb />visited those in Conection with them, but those whom
					<lb />they found adher&apos;d to their Preaching, So among the
					<lb />rest I was an object of their care, and by ocasion
					<lb />of a Visit of the Late Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>tr</hi> Eliz. Clagget. found
					<lb />freedom to deslose the concern of my heart in a hearty
					<lb />Conversation with her. She asur&apos;d me that our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi>
					<lb />aim was to make me intirely happy, and gave me also
					<lb />great incouragement to hope for fellowship with His
				
			</p>
			<cb/>
			<p>
				
					<lb />Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi>, this was very Comfortable to me and not long soon after what 
					<lb />I was admitted to a Band among Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>trs</hi> with whom cou&apos;d
					<lb />converse freely Concerning the situation of my heart, to my
					<lb />real comfort &amp; blessing. being very much distresd, on
					<lb />Such an Ocassion, I spoke very openheartadly of my Misery
					<lb />and concern, when the beforemention&apos;d Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>tr</hi> in a feeling
					<lb />Manner display&apos;d the loving Condescension of our d<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>
					<lb />in taking upon himself our Guilt &amp; Misery, and by His
					<lb />Meritorious Suffrings &amp; death making a full atonement
					<lb />for all Sin, procuring thereby peace and pardon for every
					<lb />Soul who Concious of their wretchedness turn&apos;d to Him
					<lb />with a Simple Confidence in his Mercy. at which I
					<lb />was so deeply affected that retiring in my way home I
					<lb />earnestly intreated our d<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> to grant me the happy
					<lb />experience of His saving power &amp; deliverance from the 
					<lb />Misery of the Fall &amp; depravity of my own nature &amp; for
					<lb />his wounds sake to bestow on me that pardon &amp; peace which
					<lb />he had merited for me, I had not gone far in this situation
					<lb />of mind before He graciously drew near my heart, and I
					<lb />was thereby so overpower&apos;d that all my former Misery
					<lb />Vanish&apos;d, instead of which I felt such Peace &amp; Comfort
					<lb />that I cou&apos;d scarce recolect how it had been with me, but
					<lb />went on my way rejoicing in God my Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> who had regarded
					<lb />my lone estate &amp; had help&apos;d me out of all my distress.
					<lb />Not long after I was rec&apos;d into the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> in April
					<lb />1745 to my great Joy, this abas&apos;d me very much on
					<lb />account of the unexpected favour it was to me.
					<lb />but I went on Chearfull in my course till Aug<hi rend='superscript:true;'>st</hi>
					<lb />following, when by opportunity of a visit by some

					<lb />B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> tho recd Sist<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> were spoken with individualy
					<lb />Concerning the aim &amp; intention of reception. This made
					<lb />a deep impression on my mind and being apointed to 
					<lb />be at Pudsy the Sunday following I grew exceedingly
					<lb />Concerned about my self least I shou&apos;d not answer
					<lb />the end &amp; aim of my Call to the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> being this
					<lb />porplext in my way thither my recourse was to
					<lb />my d<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> who Comforted and reasur&apos;d me of His
					<lb />Love &amp; favour towards me, but upon my arrival at
					<lb />Pudsy how great was my Surprize, when the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi>
					<lb />told me that our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> had directed them to invite
					<lb />me with them to the Holy Com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi>, I was at once so
					<lb />struck with Joy and awe that I scarce knew what
					<lb />to think, but reflecting on the particular instance
					<lb />of His feeling nearness on the road, I was incourag&apos;d
					<lb />to Venture my All upon Him, and injoyed this Highest
					<lb />good Sacramentally to my great comfort &amp; Blessing
					<lb />In the year 1746 the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> began to regulate &amp; Settle
					<lb />Oeconimys, I got permission to move into the first of 
					<lb />this regulation at Oxhay&apos;s. Where the Manner of 
					<lb />Life being Quite new to me and expecting in myself
					<lb />Something extraordinary, I came so far into my
					<lb />own reason that I gren perplext, and tho more
					<lb />so as I had gone to the Com<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> which thro&apos; an 
					<lb />Ocurence not altogether clear to me, I had also
					<lb />Misd once
				
			</p>
				<cb/>
			<p>
				
					<lb />this led me so far that I was at last so distressd I 
					<lb />knew not what to do. in this porplextity I was determin&apos;d
					<lb />to take my retreat to my best Freind, with this resolve
					<lb />If it must be so, to perish at His Feet casting myself
					<lb />thus upon His Mercy I became from that time more than
					<lb />ever sencible of the cause of this my dubious state.
					<lb />and that it proceeded from my own selfworking &amp;
					<lb />Striving, whereby I cou&apos;d not come thro&apos;, as all my happiness
					<lb />depended on his free grace alone, &amp; not on any thing
					<lb />of my willing or doing, but simply depending &amp; looking
					<lb />unto Him in every case &amp; circumstance, this gave me
					<lb />the Clearest insight into the poor Sinners happiness
					<lb />I ever had before, &amp; prov&apos;d an abiding blessing to
					<lb />me thro&apos; all future Viscisitudes I learn&apos;d daily more
					<lb />to know the poverty of my own heart and the in
					<lb />Sufficientcy of human reason. and as in the year
					<lb />1748 I mov&apos;d with other Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>trs</hi> to the Little Moore
					<lb />Oeconimy, and was apointed to Visit the Country Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>trs</hi>
					<lb />it prov&apos;d a blessed school to my own heart, being
					<lb />Concious of my unfittness &amp; want of experience, which
					<lb />often drew tears from my eyes but gave rise to many 
					<lb />tender &amp; Sinnerlike Conversations with my souls Friend
					<lb />whose Consolation, supported and comforted me on all
					<lb />ocassions. my Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>trs</hi> who with me had the grace to be
					<lb />Members of the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> and particularly my elder
					<lb />Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>tr</hi> was a comfort to me. but as it pleas&apos;d our
					<lb />Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>

					<lb />to call her to himself in the year 1749. which was
					<lb />a painfull Circumstance to me, as thereby I lost in her
					<lb />a tender faithfull heart, whose conversation had been
					<lb />usefull and edifying to me upon many Ocassions, but
					<lb />as our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> had aprov&apos;d himself in so many cases
					<lb />to my heart as able to comfort &amp; Supply all my
					<lb />nescesitys So I again cast myself upon Him anew
					<lb />and thereby found a fresh proof of His tenderness &amp;
					<lb />faithfullness torwards me, his poor and Bashfull one.
					<lb />In the year 1752, the Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>trs</hi> mov&apos;d into their new
					<lb />Choir House out of the several Oeconimy&apos;s, but
					<lb />as some few still remain&apos;d in the Pudsy-town
					<lb />Oeconimy I mov&apos;d thither with another Sis<hi rend='superscript:true;'>tr</hi> to
					<lb />inspect the same Oeconimy. but got permission
					<lb />in a few months to Change with one out of the
					<lb />Choir House, and came thereby at last to my
					<lb />long desir&apos;d home, rejoic&apos;d &amp; thankfull for all the
					<lb />kind &amp; gracious leading &amp; dealings of my D<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Lord
					<lb />who had brought me thus far
