    <p><a href="#mlpla000072.html">North of England</a><br />Memoir of our late B<sup>r.</sup> <a href="#mlper000586.html">Jacob Borck</a> who <br />departed at <a href="#mlpla000025.html"
      >Bedford</a>. <em>Oct. 24. 1791</em></p>
    <p> Our late Bro. having left no written account <br /> of his Life, we can only say the following: <br /> He was born at <a href="#mlpla000210.html">Arendal in Norway</a><em>Oct. 13. 1727</em>.
      <br /> He lost his Father when very Young, the pray- <br /> ers &amp; admonitions of his Mother who was a <br /> pious Woman &amp; sought to Educate him in the <br /> nurture &amp; admonition of
      the Lord were a great <br /> blessing to him, as a Child, &amp; when at <em>14 Years of <br /> In age</em> he went to <a href="#mlpla000211.html">Copenhagen</a> &amp; there become Sur- <br />
      geons Mate in the Danish Army, having been <br /> brought up in that time of Life; In <em>1756</em> he enterd <br /> Into the Service of the Russians army as Surgeon, <br /> &amp; being in <a
        href="#mlpla000212.html">Russia</a>, he was noticed by several <br /> persons of the highest Rank, both on Account <br /> of his engaging manners &amp; Skilfulness in his <br /> profession,
      especially by the Viceroy of <a href="#mlpla000213.html">Ukraine</a><br /> who greatly favord him, &amp; with whom he <br /> travelled thro various parts of <a href="#mlpla000212.html"
        >Russia</a>, but thro' <br /> these conexions he was led into bad Company, &amp; <br /> sinful habits, by which means he lost those <br /> impressions of our Savioursgrace, which he <br /> had
      received in his Younger Years when he <br />had been solidly awakened, &amp; obtained a view <br /> in Spirit of our Sav<sup>rs</sup> sufferings, which remain- <br /> ed unforgetten by him. He
      however felt <br />great uneasiness of mind, amidst the gaieties <br /> &amp; pleasures of the World, which he once disclosed </p>

    <p> to a person of Rank in <a
        href="#mlpla000212.html">Russia</a> acquainted with <br /> the B<sup>rn</sup> especially with <a href="#mlper000566.html">Count Zinzendorff</a>, who <br /> spoke to him in and encourageng
      manner, &amp; <br /> whose conversation was greatly blessed to him <br /> the above mentioned person at the same time <br /> related to him several particulars concerning <br /> the
        Cong<sup>n</sup> of the B<sup>rn</sup> which created a wish in him, <br /> to become more nearly acquainted with them. <br /> Accordingly in <em>1739</em> when he quitted <a
        href="#mlpla000212.html">Russia</a>, he <br /> resolved to pay a visit to the Cong<sup>n</sup> at <a href="#mlpla000150.html">Zeist</a>, intend- <br /> ing to go from thence to <a
        href="#mlpla000072.html">England</a>, to enter into his <br />Majestys Service on board a Westindia Ship. The first <br />meeting he attended at <a href="#mlpla000150.html">Zeist</a> was a
      singing meeting <br /> during which he was so overpowerd with a feeling of <br /> divine Grace, that it was immediately made clear <br /> to him that this was the people he belonged to, having
      <br /> always from his infancy had a desire to live among <br /> Children of <a href=".html">God</a>:, Here he also got acquainted with <a href="#mlper000566.html">Count <br /> Zinzendorff</a>,
      who received him very cordially, Never- <br /> theless he for the present, pursued his intentions <br /> of proceeding to <a href="#mlpla000072.html">England</a>, where he engaged as Sur- <br />
      geon onboord the Monarque in which Station he <br /> remained about a Year, during the whole of which <br /> time the Vessel lay in the harbours He kept up in <br /> the mean time an
      acquaintance with the B<sup>rn</sup> in <br /><a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>: But the great Wickedness &amp; abandoned <br /> life of the Ships crews, to which he was witness was <br />
      so disgusting to him, that he was glad to obtain <br /> his dissmission. After this he lodged for a short time <br /> with a B<sup>r</sup> &amp; S<sup>r</sup> in <a href="#mlpla000054.html"
        >London</a> &amp; being desirous of coming <br /> into still closer connection with the Cong<sup>n</sup> of the B<sup>rn</sup></p>

    <p> went in <em>Oct<sup>r.</sup> 1760</em>
      according to their advice to <a href="#mlpla000025.html">Bedford</a><br /> where he moved into the Single B<sup>rns</sup> House.</p>
    <p> Tho' he had it at first very hard in externals yet he <br /> never despaired but was always thankful to our <br />Sav<sup>r</sup> for having brought him thither, &amp; used to express <br />
      himself to that effect, that he should esteem it the <br /> greatest favor to live with Children of <a href=".html">God</a>, were he even <br /> necessitated to live on Bread &amp; Water. He
      first engaged <br /> with the late <a href=".html">Doc. Vowel</a> as a partner in business, but <br /> after sometime this partnership was dissolved, &amp; <br />he set up for himself as Surgeon
      &amp; Apothecary. </p>
    <p> He was received in the Cong<sup>n</sup> <em>April 20 1761</em> &amp; admitted <br /> to the holy Comunion<em>Sept<sup>r</sup> 26 in the same Year</em>. </p>
    <p><em>Nov<sup>r</sup> 19<sup>th</sup> 1766</em>he was married to the <a href=".html">S. Sister Hanah <br /> Scorfield</a> of the Choir House at <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulnec</a>, his present
      <br /> Widow by whom he has had one Daughter, now a <br /> member of the Cong<sup>n</sup> at <a href="#mlpla000025.html">Bedford</a>, He was very success <br /> full in his profession, whereby
      he also proved a bless- <br /> ing to many of his patients in their dying mom- <br /> ents, was respected in the Town &amp; neighbourhood, <br /> &amp; always a steady Friend to the poor even to
      his own <br /> disadvantage. Tho his warm &amp; positive temper<br /> &amp; disposition sometimes caused him trouble, <br /> Yet his upright Sincere &amp; generous mind pro- <br /> cured him
      many Friends by whom he was much <br /> esteemed, The reflection on his past unfaithful- <br /> ness to our SavioursGrace, &amp; the powerful sensa- <br /> tions he had of his great depravity,
      caused him <br /> indeed many heavy hours, but amidst all this he <br /> cleaved as a poor pardoned Sinner to his Redeemer</p>

    <p> &amp; experienced rich comforts from him, which was
      <br /> more especially perceptible in the last years of his <br /> Life, when he grew more chearful &amp; happy &amp; resigned<br /> His constitution which was naturally strong, <br /> had been
      much impaired by fatiague of body &amp; <br /> mind, about 5 Years ago he got a paralitic Stroke<br /> which greatly enfeabled him, Since this time he <br />suffered greatly from increasing
      weakness, which <br /> at last brought on a total delay of strength. His <br /> present Widow our dear <a href=".html">Sister Borck</a>, has shew'n <br /> great &amp; unremitting tenderness in
      faithfully nur- <br /> sing him during this long period of illess. Amidst <br />his sufferings which was very great, his patience<br /> was exemplary, &amp; he always expressed himself
      <br />thankful for the least services done him. </p>
    <p> When visited his favorite topick was the Love &amp; <br /> forbearance of our Sav<sup>r</sup> so consisintly displayed <br /> in the mercy shewn to him, being plucked as <br /> a brand out of
      the fire. Several weeks before <br /> his departure it was evident, that he would not <br /> continue long here below, from which time <br /> forward, his mind seemed wholly disengaged<br />
      from all earthly cares, &amp; occupied in converse <br /> with our Sav<sup>r</sup>, he frequently prayed fervently<br /> to him, entreating our Sav<sup>r</sup> to strengthen him &amp; <br />
      support him in his trouble, &amp; especially to be <br /> near him in his last hours, He once told a <br />Brother who visited him that altho he had the </p>
    
    PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> full assurance that he
      should go to our Sav<sup>r</sup><br /> as an absolved sinner, yet he could not deny <br /> that he felt some dread at the thoughts of the <br /> separation of Soul &amp; Body, but some days
      <br /> after he intimated to the same Brother, that <br /> he could now say with thanks to our Sav<sup>r</sup><br /> that this dread had been entirely removed. <br /> A day or two before his
      departure, he expressed <br /> in a very emphatical manner, his thankful <br /> ness for having brought him to his ransom'd <br />Congregation &amp; sealed his Salvation. </p>
    <p><em>Oct<sup>r.</sup> 24<sup>th</sup> 1791</em> he was no longer able to speak, <br /> &amp; from that time lay Still in sweet expectati- <br /> on of that blessed moment when his Redeemed
      <br /> Soul should be translated into the mansions <br /> of bliss. This favor was granted him about <br /> nine o Clock the same Evening when he <br /> departed softly &amp; happily aged 64
      years 11 days</p>
    <p>Blessed are the dead, which die in the <br />Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit, <br /> that they may rest from their Labour, &amp; <br /> their works do follow them. Rev<sup>l</sup>
