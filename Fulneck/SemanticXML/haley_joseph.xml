					<p> The life of <persName ref="#mlper000554">Joseph Haley</persName> who has left the following in writing I was born at <placeName>Little Town</placeName> in the <placeName
							ref="#mlpla000030">Parish of Birstall</placeName> in <placeName ref="#mlpla000084">Yorkshire</placeName>
						<date type="birth" when-iso="1727-06-25">June 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1727</date>. My Parents were very poor &amp; belong&apos;d to the <orgName religion="Anglican"
							>Church of England</orgName>, but <date notAfter="1736" cert="medium">before I was 11 years old</date>, I was <name occupation="apprentice">bound Prentice</name> for the
						Space of 10 Years to a Broad <name occupation="clothier">Clothier</name>, which I faithfully served in <placeName>Hardshead Parish</placeName>. In the middle of my time
							<persName ref="#mlper000536">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Ingham</persName> &amp; <persName>Delamotte</persName> began to preach at <placeName>Smith House</placeName>
						&amp; <placeName>Rawhead</placeName>, where I often went to hear them &amp; got a lively Impression of the Friend of Sinners. But my Master being a Cross old Man, he would not
						let one go to hear the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>, and as my time was almost out, I begd our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName> to keep me near his Person. My time being out I hired myself with another Master, who was a <orgName religion="methodism">Methodist</orgName>, when I
						became more Religious than before but could never get any Satisfaction &amp; my heart grew very dead &amp; cold. A the end of my Year I went to live at
							<placeName>Hallifax</placeName> to be an <name occupation="holster">Hostler</name>, there I plung&apos;d myself into all manner of wickedness. Soon after I went to live at
							<placeName ref="#mlpla000050">Leeds</placeName> where I was a <name occupation="servant">Gentlemans Servant</name>, here I became still more wicked &amp; miserable <hi
							rend="strikethrough">being</hi>
						<add place="margin">tho&apos; I was</add> always accused in my Mind &amp; knowing at the same time my Course was hurtfull to body &amp; Soul, so that my Life become burthensome
						to me.</p>
					<p> My Mother being a good old <orgName religion="methodism">Methodist</orgName> &amp; knowing of my going on She was much dissatisfied with me, &amp; often desired me to come home
						&amp; settle to my own Business, but I found it very difficult to leave my old wicked Companions, thinking I was fit for no other Company. Now my <name type="emotion"
							>Confliction was broke</name> &amp; I was befall&apos;n with a <name health="disease">sore Sickness</name>, which reduced me to great poverty &amp; being hardly fit for any
						thing, I then began to wish, that I could have called back the Time I had lost &amp; Spend without our Saviour.</p>
					<p> Having served in this place 4 Years and 5 Months I left my Master &amp; went to live with my Parents at <placeName>High Town</placeName> but </p>

					<p> did not know what Course to take, for I was like a Spotted Bird even amongst the worldly People. I went again to hear the <orgName religion="methodism">Methodists</orgName>
						however here I could find no comfort &amp; my poor Heart felt always dissatisfied which made me resolved to go &amp; hear the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> but I always found
						Something to hinder me. Soon after it happened that I went to live with <persName>W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> Taylor</persName> a Single Man of
							<persName>Cleckheaton</persName> who belongs to the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>. Hearing that there was a very pious <name occupation="minister"
							>Minister</name> at <placeName>White Chapple</placeName> I went to hear his <name event="religious">Sermons</name>, but as he pre<add place="above">a</add>ched only the
						Law, I soon got a Dislike &amp; in the beginning of the Year <date when-iso="1757">1757</date> I went to hear <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi></roleName> Pyrleaus</persName> who preachd on these Words: <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>, save us, we perish, <name type="emotion">there my
							heart was laid so hold of that I shall never forget it.</name> Having great uneasiness of Mind, I wished for an opportunity to speak with a <roleName type="honorific">B<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> which happened soon after to my great Satisfaction. I also got leave to come to the Classes of the Single Men &amp; in <date
							when-iso="1757-03">March <hi rend="strikethrough">the same Year</hi></date>
						<date when-iso="1759"><add place="above">1759</add></date> I was <name event="reception">received into the Society</name>, at which I felt our <roleName type="honorific"
							>Savr</roleName> very near to me. I beg&apos;d He might keep me close to Him. I being so exposed to the world made me think I should never come thro&apos;. I often came to
							<placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName> &amp; saw the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> lived so happy together as I never saw People live
						before, I thought I could never be rightly happy unless I was there. Yet I could never offer to ask for it feeling my own Misery &amp; wickedness I thought they would never
						allow in to come there. In this way I continued like a Standing Water till <date when-iso="1760-03"><add place="above">March</add> 1760</date> when my
							<roleName>Master</roleName>
						<persName>W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>. Taylor</persName> got leave to move into the <placeName>Choir House</placeName> which <name type="emotion">caused me many Tears</name>
						thinking our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> had left me alone to myself on account of my unfaithfulness, what would become of me I did
						not know. As I was very uneasy &amp; being resolved to become our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> I desired leave to live in the
							<orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> at <placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName> which I also obtain&apos;d &amp; moved thither
							<date when-iso="1760-10-20">Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1760</date> very glad &amp; thankfull. <date when-iso="1761-03-23">March 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> 1761</date> I was <name event="reception">received into the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName></name>
						which was a great Blessing to me. In <date when-iso="1761-07">July</date> I had a <name health="disease">hard Sickness</name>, in during which our <roleName type="honorific"
								>Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> gave me a new Seal of </p>
					<p> my Grace Election &amp; comforted me about all past things. <date when-iso="1761-12-20">Decr 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1761</date> I was made a partaker of my Lords
						Corpse &amp; Blood in the <name event="sacrament">holy Sacrament</name> which was an unspeakable Grace to me, &amp; I esteemed this Year a Year of Blessings bestowed upon me,
						which I shall never be able to express, &amp; I wish that I may always have that Impression of it till our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName> calls me home to himself. Oh! could I but always prize my Call &amp; Election sufficiently &amp; thank our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> that he has granted me a nest amongst his People I cannot but be ashamed that my heart does not burn more in Love towards Him. Thus
						far his own words.</p>
					<p> In the <date when-iso="1763">Year 1763</date> he got a Call to go to <placeName ref="#mlpla000025">Bedford</placeName>, of which he accepted in a Childlike manner &amp; served
							the<orgName> B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> in <placeName ref="#mlpla000025">Bedford</placeName> as <name occupation="cook">Cook</name> for several Years &amp;
						then went to <placeName ref="#mlpla000035">Duckenfield</placeName>. On <date when-iso="1767-03-26">March 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1767</date> he came again to live here
						&amp; went on in a happy Course. In the beginning of <date when-iso="1770-06">June 1770</date> he went to <add place="above">live in</add> the <orgName en="œconomy"
							>Oeconomy</orgName> at <placeName ref="#mlpla000059">Mirfield</placeName>. He was Naturally a peevish Temper, but his plain Honest &amp; upright way of acting made him
						beloved amongst his B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>. He was free &amp; openhearted with his Labourer nor did he speak better of himself than it was. He often felt the
						oppression of his Sickly Tabernacle, especially in the Spring and Autumn, but this last Spring it soon appeared that his <name health="disease">Sickness was a
							Consumption</name> &amp; that he would not recover again on which account he wishd to come to <placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName> &amp; go home in the
							<placeName>Choirhouse</placeName> last here, which was also granted him, <date when-iso="1772-07-11"><add place="above">last</add> July the 11<hi rend="superscript"
							>th</hi></date> for which he was very thankful. He spend his time in the <placeName>Sick Room</placeName> in a true Concession with our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>, waiting with resignation for the happy Hour of his Dissolution which came to pass the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> instant,
						when our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> took him happily to himself as a Sinner who had found Grace in His Death and Sufferings. </p>
