					<lb />Memoirs of the late happily departed Sister
					<lb />Esther Cleake who on the 27<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> of May 1791
					<lb />at Fulneck enterd into the joy of her Lord
					<lb />In the 76<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> Year of her age.
					<lb />She has left the following account concerning
					<lb />her Pilgrimage here below.
					<lb />I think my dear Brethren &amp; Sisters will
					<lb />like to hear somthing of my Course through
					<lb />this time which I will gladly relate to the
					<lb />honour of my dearest Saviour. I was Born at
					<lb />Kirton in Lincolnshire, July 8<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1715 my Parents died when
					<lb />I was very young, was therefore left an Orphan
					<lb />to Providence, or to my dear Creator &amp; Saviour
					<lb />for whom I was born &amp; destined surely.
					<lb />To tell my dear Brethrening &amp; Sisters of the
					<lb />Goodness, the mercy &amp; kindness, the love &amp; faithfulness
					<lb />of My dear Lord &amp; Saviour to me a poor Child.
					<lb />my weak words fall very short to express the
					<lb />praise that is due to him, from me, for his wonders
					<lb />have been without end, thanks, thousand thanks
					<lb />be to the Lamb for ever &amp; ever. I will now relate
					<lb />some of the particulars of the tender lendings of
					<lb />My gracious &amp; most faithfull Lord. The first
					<lb />impression of grace I remember, was when I was
					<lb />about four Years old, when one day kneeling by
					<lb />a choir with a book in my hand, in which was those
					<lb />words, Seek and ye shall find knock, &amp; it shall

					<lb />shall be append unto You, I felt somthing
					<lb />particular at the time, I had a very quick under
					<lb />standing for my years, and a very sensible feeling
					<lb />of what was right, and wrong I wanted to be a good
					<lb />Child that I might go to Heaven, on that account
					<lb />I was much praised, which wou&apos;d have been more
					<lb />hurtfull to me, but the dear Holy Ghost who had 
					<lb />begun his work in my heart, pleased me continualy, my
					<lb />wicked and sinfull nature, which kept me low &amp;
					<lb />consions that I did not deserve that praise, which
					<lb />was a grace to me at that time, so it checked my
					<lb />Satanick pride, which I felt very sensible, Yet 
					<lb />from many circumstances I thought God must
					<lb />love me, but how it was I cou&apos;d not tell, I have
					<lb />I was a sinner, In my 11<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> year I was very thought
					<lb />full and distress&apos;d, felt guilt with the impression
					<lb />that I did not love God, nor cou&apos;d I promise him
					<lb />which one day a little bird was made use of to 
					<lb />shew me that I cou&apos;d not praise my Creator even
					<lb />as a Bird cou&apos;d I had also strange Idea&apos;s about
					<lb />him, what kind of a form he had, and was much
					<lb />perplexed about it at this time I had a dream where
					<lb />in I thought God allmighty was in a parlour in 
					<lb />the house where I was, and that he was a Man of
					<lb />which I was very glad, &amp; thought then One cou&apos;d be
					<lb />familliar with him. But not understanding the 
					<lb />gracious lending of my dear Saviour, I continued
					<lb />extremly
				
			<cb/>
				
					<lb />extremly distress&apos;d, thought I commited Sin
					<lb />evry moment by the strange thoughts I had, &amp;
					<lb />they was of such a nature, I cou&apos;d not tell them
					<lb />to any body, nor wou&apos;d they have understood me,
					<lb />but wearied indeed with trying to help myself
					<lb />a thought came in my mind, As I can not help
					<lb />these thoughts God Almighty has nothing
					<lb />against me. In that moment my mercifull
					<lb />and compassinate Saviour drew near with his
					<lb />love and gave me peace, it was as If he said to
					<lb />me, I have nothing against thee, I was amazed
					<lb />but did not know how to account for it, to be
					<lb />loved by God in such a manner, from that time
					<lb />When those thoughts came again I cou&apos;d believe
					<lb />he had nothing against me for it, but not under
					<lb />standing the right poor Sinners path I came into
					<lb />an esteem self rightious course, Striveing with
					<lb />all my might to be good by other means then
					<lb />Jesus blood, I fasted &amp; prayd, wanting to be as
					<lb />good as the Primitive Christians, not likeing any
					<lb />one to be better then myself, here my Satanick
					<lb />pride show&apos;d itself to a great degree, All how
					<lb />unwilling was I to be saved by grace I went on
					<lb />for some time in this manner. My Aunt dieing who
					<lb />brought me up, I became a Second time an Orphan
					<lb />indeed She treated me as If She had known my
					<lb />destination. Ah the wonders of My dear Saviours
					<lb />love which I did not then understand through

					<lb />His kind providence in My 19<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> year I went
					<lb />to London into Lady Scarborough&apos;s Family.
					<lb />who had sent for me to wait on her little Neice
					<lb />and My dear Saviour put it into her heart from the first
					<lb />moment to be remarkable kind to me, and the whole
					<lb />family shew&apos;d a great regard &amp; respect for my religious
					<lb />turn of mind, which they found was sincere
					<lb />(not on account of outward gifts or quatifications)
					<lb />but the dear Holy Ghost in whose School I then
					<lb />was, gave me a constant sence of My depraved
					<lb />nature in all it shapes, and finding I fell so far
					<lb />short of what I thought I shou&apos;d be, this kept
					<lb />me low and in some sence humble, and kept the
					<lb />ballance against that hartfull prais which is
					<lb />often given. I served also in several other families
					<lb />namely Lord Orrory, Lady Charlott Edan&apos;s &amp;
					<lb />the Duke of Buckclugh. My dear Saviour
					<lb />and most faithfull Shepherd helped me through
					<lb />with all my imperfections so wonderfully
					<lb />that If I may humbly say so, I found favour
					<lb />with God, &amp; Man, but I nor no body else, thought
					<lb />what was prepareing for me. In my 26<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> year I
					<lb />return&apos;d to Lady Scarborough who always received
					<lb />me with the greatest kindness, At this time I fell
					<lb />again into self working fasted &amp; prayed much, till I 
					<lb />was quite weared finding it did me no good, Once in
					<lb />the Year 42 while at prayer I felt somthing very
					<lb />blessed, it was quick like the fleeting of a Star
				
			<cb/>
				
					<lb />but it seemed to me all that was good, it was
					<lb />Light Peace, Joy, all happiness in One moment
					<lb />I thought it was the Holy Spirit, &amp; praied to
					<lb />feel more of it. Soon after I received a letter
					<lb />concerning the preaching of the Methodists which
					<lb />I had never heard of. I was very much biggote to
					<lb />the Church &amp; thought it a shame to go any where else
					<lb />I thought how ever I wou&apos;d inquire about them what
					<lb />kind of people they wear, it happend at this time a
					<lb />Methodist came in My way, and by his conversation
					<lb />I was convinced of what I wanted, the knowledge of the
					<lb />atonement of our Saviour for My Sins, then all his
					<lb />gracious leading was brought to my mind so that I
					<lb />knew it was a faith from God, the person lent me
					<lb />a Sermon book of Sermons of M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Whitfields
					<lb />the more I read the more it was opened to me that
					<lb />I wanted a Saviour, for my mind took a turn and
					<lb />I found some rest from my labour, and saw that it
					<lb />was Christs rightousness that I wanted, I enterd
					<lb />with my whole mind into the matter, got all the
					<lb />books I cou&apos;d of that kind amongst the rest I got
					<lb />the Brethrens little Hymn book which sat&apos;d me
					<lb />exceedingly well espicialy One Verse, viz: If I
					<lb />glimse in My own breast Feel of a Christian bliss
					<lb />Then on the truth of it let me rest. That such a
					<lb />Life there is. At length my good Lady found I had
					<lb />got Methodist books, but did not think I was so deep
					<lb />in the matter, for She had a better opinion of me
					<lb />then that I wou&apos;d follow such people, but one time
				
			</p>
				<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_14_2ClarkEsther-04.jpg" n="4"/>
			<p>
				
					<lb />being with her at Court, She caught me reading a
					<lb />letter which she took from me, wherein She found I
					<lb />had been Once at the Tabernacle, She was much
					<lb />concern&apos;d &amp; took the greatest pain possible to diss
					<lb />waid me from it, but I was Devinly convinced of
					<lb />the truth of the Gospel, my Lady forbid me to go
					<lb />to the Tabernacle, I told her I cou&apos;d wou&apos;d not with
					<lb />out leting her Ladyship know, I thought I cou&apos;d do
					<lb />with books &amp; Stay at Home, at this time the family
					<lb />went into the Country, where was a good friend a
					<lb />Minister who took great pain to prevent my
					<lb />going too deep in my present Ideas, he brought me
					<lb />many books but to no purpose, my heart was afraid
					<lb />of the truth, We return&apos;d to London and I grew very
					<lb />uneasy, found I cou&apos;d not be faithful without
					<lb />going to hear the preaching, I therefore desired
					<lb />leave, which was not granted. My good Lady was
					<lb />now very much distress&apos;d about me, She wanted
					<lb />to keep me, &amp; out of Love &amp; kindness she did her
					<lb /> what She cou&apos;d to perswaid me, She wanted
					<lb />me again to be advis&apos;d by some Minsters,
					<lb />I chose the Bishop of Oxford (Sacher) for that
					<lb />purpose I was so clear in My matter I feared no
					<lb />thing, my B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> went with me to the Bishop and
					<lb />accused me of leaving the Church, I told him
					<lb />it was because they did not preach our Saviours
					<lb />Sufferings, &amp; I was fully asured nothing else
				
			<cb/>
				
					<lb />cou&apos;d save me, this he aprov&apos;d of, as to good work
					<lb />I said, when the tree is good, the fruit will be good,
					<lb />he was very tender with me finding I was Sincere
					<lb />If it was possible I was more confirm&apos;d in my point
					<lb />then before, My dear Lady was much dissapointed
					<lb />but I cou&apos;d not help it, here She rested, she had
					<lb />done all She cou&apos;d but My matter remained to leave
					<lb />her, or have leave to to go to the preachings, at last
					<lb />I con&apos;d do no longer, therefore went to hear the
					<lb />preaching, I was wanted before I came home again,
					<lb />My Lady ask&apos;d me where I had been, I told her, She
					<lb />said I had gone without leave, I said because her
					<lb />Ladyship wou&apos;d not have given the leave If I had
					<lb />ask&apos;d upon this She sent me out of the room
					<lb />to see me no more, She was affraid to keep me on
					<lb />account of the Children &amp; Servants, least I shou&apos;d
					<lb />bring them into my way of thinking, &amp; when I went
					<lb />with her to Court it was a shame at that time to be
					<lb />a Methodest. But My dear Saviour had prepared
					<lb />my way for me, I went to bed as composed as if
					<lb />nothing had happened, In the morning I rose with
					<lb />great chearfulness, like a Bird releas&apos;d from a
					<lb />Cage, and agent to the Tabernacle at 6 o&apos;Clock from
					<lb />Cavendish Square, which was a wonder of God for I
					<lb />had nothing, nor any prospect how I shou&apos;d get my
					<lb />bread, had very little money, many hard things was
					<lb />set before me, and in myself nothing to depend on, nor
					<lb />had I any acquaintance here, Our dear Saviours

			<p>
				
					<lb />words became litterally true, seek first the
					<lb />Kingdom of God &amp; its Righteousness and all things
					<lb />shall be added unto You, I was like a Child
					<lb />turn&apos;d out of doors (was again an Orphan) But
					<lb />my ever faithfull Lord whose Hand &amp; Eye was over
					<lb />me cared for me in evry respect. My Lady gave me
					<lb />proof more of her kindness to me, finding I had
					<lb />no acquaintance, sent me word that I shou&apos;d lodge
					<lb />there till I cou&apos;d find a home the Servants was
					<lb />amaized at me, because I was otherwise no person
					<lb />of courage, but they did not know that I had found
					<lb />the Pearl of great price. I stay&apos;d with my Brother
					<lb />in the day time till the preaching time at the
					<lb />Tabernacle, my Brother was very shy to me, he was
					<lb />sorry for My leaving such a good place. He look&apos;d
					<lb />into my books, made a good observation &amp; said all
					<lb />professions make the Scriptures there rule, but
					<lb />If this inward feeling can be true it must come from
					<lb />God. It pleased he to hear him say so much.
					<lb />I enquir&apos;d of him for the Brethrens Chapel that I 
					<lb />might see the people to whom by little Hymn Book
					<lb />belong&apos;d (this was in Feb<hi rend='superscript:true;'>y</hi> 1744) He directed me
					<lb />but when I came to Fetter Lane there was no preaching,
					<lb />I enquir&apos;d at the Chapel House S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Wheeler kindly
					<lb />ask&apos;d me to come in Shewed me the Chapel, and what
					<lb />She told the at that time of Our Saviour walking
					<lb />amongst his People, made such an impression on
				
			<cb/>
				
					<lb />me that I never shall forget. It Tallied with my own
					<lb />experience, I enquired if the Countes of Zinzendorf
					<lb />did not want a Servant, but heard She was not in England.
					<lb />I went to Speak with M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Whitfield to advise with
					<lb />him, and found him at B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> John Syms&apos;s, I told them my
					<lb />case just as it was, S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Syms according to her kind way
					<lb />in such cases took me into her house, thus I left my
					<lb />good Lady &amp; all my old Friends, with greatfull
					<lb />thanks for all their kindness &amp; I heartly pray that
					<lb />My dear Lady May not loose her reward, I cou&apos;d do no
					<lb />other but follow my gracious Lord and Saviour, B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp;
					<lb />S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Syms Shewed me great kindness, M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Whitfield &amp;
					<lb />his Wife was also very kind to me, but M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Whitfield
					<lb />going to George in about six weeks, this connexion
					<lb />was ended. B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Syms being atach&apos;d to the B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi>
					<lb />I often went with them to Fetterlane, I had receive&apos;d
					<lb />many blessings by going to the Tabernacle, at this
					<lb />time B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Syms moved, from which time I left off
					<lb />going to the Taber. Now my good Lord led me Step
					<lb />by Step as it pleased him both inwardly &amp; outwardly
					<lb />in a most gracious manner which brings these lines
					<lb />to my mind. With patience immense, And love so
					<lb />intense, He hath led me on, I&apos;m lost in amazment
					<lb />When thinking thereon. Now being come to my proper
					<lb />home, the dear Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> where I have enjoy&apos;d more blessings
					<lb />then I am able to express, they have been so many, and so
					<lb />great, and my call to the dear Congn is so clear and weighty
					<lb />to me, that I can say, next to our Saviour, the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> is the

			<p>
				
					<lb />dearest thing to me, I am a Sinner to whom belongs
					<lb />nothing but shame &amp; confusion of face, but it has
					<lb />pleased him to open to me the treasure of his Love
					<lb />&amp; great Salvation, which has been sealed to me by
					<lb />his Spirit, by his Word, by his Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> as an eternal truth
					<lb />for such was my make that I must know it as a truth
					<lb />for myself, was truly convinced of unbeliefs, and my
					<lb />enmity against our Saviour, when this came to the
					<lb />highest pitch, I thought If there was another Saviour
					<lb />I wou&apos;d have him, I felt condemned for the thought
					<lb />and in that moment I was overpowerd with the
					<lb />love and peace of my dear Saviour, and as If he
					<lb />said to me for all this I love thee. The feeling
					<lb />and impression of his nearness, bow&apos;d me down in
					<lb />the dust before my gracious Lord, with this
					<lb />Sensation, The poor Sinners happy feeling, the holy
					<lb />shame. But My selfrighteousness still
					<lb />troubled me in various shapes, but in that feeling
					<lb />the following verse was sealed to me as the greatest
					<lb />truth, O precious precious blood, The only Holiness
					<lb />that&apos;s good, Still drop, &amp; flow &amp; cover me, it
					<lb />cursed Sinner without thee. The Scripture, the
					<lb />preachings, the Hymns, where open&apos;d with such
					<lb />truth &amp; Life which I can&apos;t describe.
					<lb />I left B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Syms with greatfull thanks for
					<lb />all their care, and went to live with M<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Delamott
					<lb />at Black Heath to take care of Betsey Holand
					<lb />her Parents being gone to Germany, here I experienc&apos;d
				
			<cb/>
				
					<lb />something particular in the first place to my shame.
					<lb />I was shewn such love and respect from this dear
					<lb />family, but what relates particularly to the heart
					<lb />was as I have said the preachings had been so blessed
					<lb />to me, being now all at once taken from all meetings,
					<lb />which I felt much store by, it was amazing to me
					<lb />that I now enjoy&apos;d such a Sabatic stillness &amp; a
					<lb />Sunshine of peace for that time, that I wanted
					<lb />nothing, but was indeed as a Child at the breast.
					<lb />I was not Yet in the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> tho&apos; I had defer&apos;d it some
					<lb />time. B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Holand how comeing from Germany
					<lb />I went with their Daughter to live with them.
					<lb />I now thought much about being received into the
					<lb />Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi>, but I had still to wait some time, which
					<lb />was very wholsome for the I was once much comforted
					<lb />by these words, Jesus thy affairs will think on,
					<lb />as thy ever loveing Head. At length the hour which
					<lb />certainly at the right moment, the Divine impression
					<lb />to me was, I am now in by Fathers House, this was
					<lb />May 18<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1747, and the 2<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> of Sep<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> following I had
					<lb />the unspeakable grace to be a partaker of my dear
					<lb />Saviours body &amp; blood in the Holy Sacrament.
					<lb />In this period ah! how good &amp; blessd was the Liturgies
					<lb />&amp; all the Meeting to my poor heart beyond all expres
					<lb />sion, I had the grace to feel that in myself I was
					<lb />a poor Creature truely convinced no one worse, had a
					<lb />solid feeling what Sin is in all its odious Shapes
					<lb />I am sensible that I have given the dear Holy Ghost
				
			</p>
				<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_14_2ClarkEsther-07.jpg" n="7"/>
			<p>
				
					<lb />to keep me low as a sinner, my dear B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi>
					<lb />will understand what that sensation is a solid
					<lb />feeling what is sin, but <unclear>not to touch sin God forbid</unclear>
					<lb />In this Year I went to live at Mile end with the
					<lb />Children here I had new appearings of my dear Saviours
					<lb />Love and grace especially relating to my Choir. I
					<lb />was drawn to read the Canticles &amp; these Disciples
					<lb />of our Saviours love to his Church was opend to
					<lb />me with such truth &amp; reallity as I can&apos;t express
					<lb />The following verse was much impressed on my mind
					<lb />at this time, O thou the fairest of mankind
					<lb />Thy beauty strike both heart &amp; mind. But
					<lb />nothing is so fair in thee. As thy sweet form
					<lb />upon the tree and can thro&apos; his love &amp; grace say
					<lb />Nothing has so struck me. As when God&apos;s
					<lb />Spirit took me too Golgotha O God be prais&apos;d
					<lb />This has a period in the Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi> of some extravegances
					<lb />But can say for myself I am truly convinc&apos;d
					<lb />by my own experiance that there was a glory
					<lb />from the Lord, indeed too great for earthly minds
					<lb />long to bear, but I expect to see it again in
					<lb />perfection without a Vail between, and with
					<lb />the whole Sinners train surround that Cavity
					<lb />where I shall dwell eternally, at this time
					<lb />that verse was realised to my heart, To be
					<lb />enamour&apos;d I know well, To have the heart quite
					<lb />overflowing, For him alone to be so glowing
					<lb />Expressions only me here fail. About this
				
			<cb/>
				
					<lb />this time I also had a new school for my own heart
					<lb />concerning the Virgin Station, and found that only
					<lb />by partaking of the Nature of the only Virgin man
					<lb />one cou&apos;d deserve that Character, this was made
					<lb />very clear to me, Fair gifts of my creation, quite
					<lb />spirit&apos;d made me disspair for this grace, the
					<lb />knowledge of myself (in this particular) I adore &amp;
					<lb />thank my dear Lord &amp; his Spirit for teaching me
					<lb />the way to turn to his precious blood, which alone
					<lb />can cleanse our hearts and make all good, I found
					<lb />it an antidote against all those sins that stick
					<lb />so close to our nature.
					<lb />In the year 1751 I was sent to care for the Single
					<lb />S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> in Ockbrook and in Sep<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 1757 I receiv&apos;d a call
					<lb />to go to Tytherton for the same purpose, and arrived
					<lb />there in the Angels <unclear>????</unclear>, this Jurney I shall
					<lb />never forget, it was very much bless&apos;d to me through
					<lb />the nearness of my gracious Lord, and the impression
					<lb />I had of the aid of his dearAngels, July 19<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1763
					<lb />I return&apos;d again to Ockbrook, and Dec<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> 11<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1772
					<lb />I arrived in London where I hope to finish my poor
					<lb />&amp; insignificant labour, In all these places my
					<lb />best Friend has help&apos;d me through in wholesome
					<lb />poverty both internally &amp; externally, and I can
					<lb />say with the Deciples, I have lacked nothing, have
					<lb />been rich in the midst of poverty, here I desire
					<lb />to give my due thanks to My dear Bretheren &amp;

					<lb />and S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi>, and particularly those of My own Choir
					<lb />for their love kindness &amp; patience towards me.
					<lb />But ah! how much is due to by dearest &amp; best
					<lb />Friend &amp; lover, for his Election of grace &amp; for the
					<lb />knowledge of his dear Wounded Person, his precious
					<lb />blood, and all what he is to me, I conclude with
					<lb />the 30<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> verse of the 43<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> Chapter of Eccleasiastious
					<lb />which well express my mind, When You Glorify the
					<lb />Lord, exalt him as much as God can; for even Yet
					<lb />will he far exceed; and when You exalt him, put forth
					<lb />all Your Strength, and be not weary, for You can
					<lb />never go for enough. Thus far our late Sisters account.
					<lb />Having serv&apos;d the Single Sisters Choirs with great
					<lb />faithfulness, and blessing in several Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>ns</hi> (had the
					<lb />confidence of her Sisters who always found in her a kind
					<lb />and Sympathizing friend ready to share with them in
					<lb />joy &amp; smart, the prosperity of every One laying very
					<lb />near her heart) till her bodily infirmities wou&apos;d no
					<lb />longer permit her to do what her heart &amp; mind was
					<lb />Still willing for June 20<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1782 She arrived here
					<lb />in Fulneck to injoy a Sabath. During the 8 years
					<lb />of her abode here, She often express&apos;d her gratitude
					<lb />to our Saviour for his kind leadings of her through
					<lb />this Vale of tears and that she had the favour to
					<lb />enjoy her time of rest in this dear Cong<hi rend='superscript:true;'>n</hi>. She had the
					<lb />love and respect of ev&apos;ry one that knew her we can with
					<lb />truth give her this testimony that She approved
				
			<cb/>
				
					<lb />herself among us as a real Child of peace.
					<lb />At our last Choir Festival She was present at all
					<lb />the meetings, which was the last time she was able
					<lb />to go out after which She lost her strength very
					<lb />perceptably but her longing to be at home with her
					<lb />dearst Lord encreased daily, two days before her
					<lb />happy departure She said a S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> that was with
					<lb />her with great emotion of heart, I go to our Saviour
					<lb />as the greatest Sinner, not one so great as I am,
					<lb />but this I can tell You, He has pardon&apos;d all my
					<lb />transgressions &amp; clothed me in the robe of his
					<lb />righteousness, on the 27<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> of May at 11 oClock
					<lb />in the forenoon She desir&apos;d to be helped up I see she said
					<lb />our Saviour he to here, now he will soon fetch me,
					<lb />after which she lay mostly Still, till 7 oClock
					<lb />in the Evening when the long wish&apos;d for moment
					<lb />came, that She departed softly &amp; happily into the 
					<lb />joy of her Lord with the blessing of her Choir
					<lb />in the 76<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> year of her Age.
