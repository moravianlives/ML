      <h2>John Morgan</h2>
      <p>Departed<em>May the 9<sup>th</sup>
            							1761</em><br/>The Youth <a href="#mlper000563.html">John Morgan</a> was born at <a href="#mlpla000199.html">Kensington near London</a><br/><em>May the 26<sup>th</sup> 1743</em>. He came to the Childn<sup>s</sup> Oeconomy at <a href="#mlpla000031.html">Buttermeer</a><br/>
         when he was <em>about 3 Years old</em>, and came from thence with the <br/> whole Oeconomy to <a href=".html">Smith house</a> in
         							<em>1749</em>. During his childhood he <br/> had a
         						promising Genius and Capacity for learning, and in his <br/> disposition had
         						something pretty and taking, but with regard to <br/> his heart there always
         						appeard a tendency to being close, and re-
         <br/>
         serv'd, which often
         						made his Brnsigh, least in futurity the same <br/> should continue and
         						consequently prove detrimental to his Boys and <br/> Youths course in the
         							Congn</p>
      <p> About the time of the Oeconomies removing from
         							<a href=".html">Smith house</a><br/> to <a href="#mlpla000048.html">Lambshill</a> in <em>1753</em> there often appeared something of the dear
         						Mo- <br/> thers Labour upon his Heart, particularly when his curiosity of
         						which <br/> he had a great share led him upon searching into things which he
         						was <br/> afterwards shy in speaking about. In this course he went on, and
         						<br/> his Br<sup>n</sup> were often very much distressed on
         						his Account, and full of <br/>fears lest his want of uprightness and
         						openness would make his course <br/>heavy to himself and painful to our
         							Saviour &amp; this Br<sup>n</sup> he had how- <br/> ever Intervals
         						betwixt, sometimes dear and promising &amp; then
         						again <br/>dark and gloomy, particularly if any thing
         						manifestly appeared against <br/> him on account of which he should become a
         						Sinner. However he <br/> applied himself with exemplary Diligence to writing
         							Cong<sup>n</sup>
         						Accounts, <br/> and showed a certain pleasure in doing whatsoever was
         						committed to <br/> him with great faithfulness and punctuallity. </p>
      <p>He was receiv'd into the great Boys choir<em>Jan<sup>y</sup> 9, 1797</em> by <a href="#mlper000166.html">B<sup>r</sup> Renatus</a><br/> which seemingly had a blessed effect upon him for a long time af-
         						<br/> ter, but his close disposition of Mind caused him many anxious<br/>
         						moments, when he heard he should be spoke with separately, and he sel- <br/>
         						dom returned from it but with red and wet Eyes on Account thereof. <br/> He
         						came to live in the <a href=".html">Choir-house</a> and learn the shoema-
         <br/>
         kers business<em>August the 21<sup>st</sup>
            							1758</em>, His diligence at his Work and <br/>desire to learn the
         						business thoroughly was pleasing to every </p>
   	
   	
   	
   	
      <p> one who had to do with him but he laboured under an impedi- <br/>
         							ment in his Eyesight which often pain'd him and made him
         						dis-
         <br/>
         pair sometimes of ever learning to work as he should do </p>
      <p> In <em>Nov<sup>r</sup> 1759</em> he was one of
         						those Youths whom our dear Johannes <br/>regulated during his visit
         						here, since which time he has been more <br/>clear and unreserved than
         						ever before. In general his course outwardly <br/> has been very orderly
         						ever since he came into the <a href=".html">choirhouse</a>, <br/> always
         						showing Obedience to his Br<sup>n</sup>
         						and esteeming that as highly <br/> necessary both in himself and others.
         						Those 3 or 4 Months past <br/> he has been much more concern'd for a
         						livelyHeart, and spoke <br/> of it with more feeling than formerly, was
         						also more clear and open<br/> &amp; had a more real connexion with our
         							Savr. In the begining of his <br/>Sickness which was towards the <em>latter end of April</em>, he did not think <br/>
         						much of going home, nor did he desire it much because his heart<br/> was
         						not in so tender to situation towards our Savr as it could &amp; <br/> should be. Several serious
         						bands were kept with him, whereby <br/> he discovered a sensibility not
         						observed in him before. The <br/> 5<sup>th</sup> Instant he
         						altered, told a Labourer he knew he was much
         <br/>
         concern'd on his
         						Account, and not without Reason, for said he <br/>my heart has not been so lively as it should,
         						but be not distress'd<br/> or troubled about me, perhaps you may think
         						it would not be agre-
         <br/>
         able to me to go home, but I can ease you on
         						that Account, and <br/> assure you my concern comes not from that Corner,
         						whenever he calls <br/> me he will take one to himself, I am his &amp; shall
         						certainly go to <br/> him, this is a clear and made out matter to me, but my
         						concern<br/> is that my heart is not more lively and warm &amp; that I have
         						not
         <br/>
         enjoy'd his precious nearness as I could and should have
         						done. <br/> This Conversation was sattisfactory. He also spoke with our
         							Sav<sup>r</sup><br/> from that time in a more Sinnerlike but confident manner <br/> as long
         						as he was able to speak, &amp; also told his Labourers and other <br/>Brnhe now knew he should go home this time express'd also
         <br/>
         a desire after it. At last it was very difficult for him to speak<br/> but when visited did all in his power to render himself intelligible </p>
      <p> and particularly to express himself about going home. The <em>7<sup>th</sup></em><br/> in the Morning he expressed again his desire to go home so as to <br/>
         						be understood, &amp; about 11 at Night his Sickness took such a turn <br/>
         						that it was thought he would go directly. </p>
      <p> From this time he took very little notice of any person or thing <br/> about him but lay
         						quite still seemingly without pain till the <em>9<sup>th</sup></em><br/> (that ever memorable day) in the evening while the Cong<sup>n</sup> was <br/>enjoying the holy Communion, about 1/2 an hour before his
         						de- <br/> parture he came quite to himself, was very sensible of his pain,
         						<br/> but not able to speak, &amp; 3/4 past 9 while the Cong<sup>n</sup> prostrated <br/> he was deliverd into the
         						hands of his Redeemer in a peculiar
         						<br/>tender manner, to whom he breathed out his spirit with the bles-
         <br/>
         sing of his Choir, &amp; during the singing of several Verses in <br/> his
         							18<sup>th</sup> Year </p></body>
