    <h2>Crispin Taylor</h2>
    <p><a href="#mlper000562.html">Crispin Taylor</a>, was born in <a href="#mlpla000102.html">Wyke in the Parish <br /> of Birstall</a><em>April y<sup>e</sup> 26, 1698</em>, and lived with <br /> his
      Father, who learnd him the Trade of a Shoemaker, <br /> till <em>April 1722</em>, being then 24 years of Age he was <br />married to <a href="#mlper000690.html">Mary Wilkinson</a>, who is his
      present Wife, <br /> and had by her 9 Children, four of which are left <br /> behind, the other five went home before him. In his <br /> married State he approved himself a carefull, lo- <br />
      ving father and a tender Husband.</p>
    <p> When <a href="#mlper000536.html">Mr. Ingham</a> first began to preach here about, <br /> he soon went to hear him, and his heart was touch<sup>d</sup><br />by the holy Ghost in the first
      Sermon he heard. <br /> From that time, he sought all Opportunities to hear <br /> the Gospel of our D<sup>r</sup>Saviours Death and Attonement <br /> After the Societies were settled here in <a
        href="#mlpla000084.html">Yorkshire</a>, <br /> and put under the Care of the Brethren, he and <br /> his Wife upon their Request were also taken in <br /> amongst them, which was a great
      Satisfaction to <br /> both, and proved a Blessingto their hearts, which <br /> made them some time after very desirous to be ta- <br /> ken into the Congregation and to be in a closer Con-
      <br /> nexion with the B<sup>rn</sup>. He therefore spoke with <br /><a href="#mlper0006927.html">B<sup>r</sup> Toltshig</a> about it, expressing his heartsdesire<br /> to be wholy our
        Saviours<em>Oct the 1<sup>st</sup> 1748</em>. he had <br /> after many earnest and repeated Requests this <br /> favour granted him<sup>&amp; his Wife </sup> to the great Joyof his <br />
      heart, for it proved an extraordinary Blessing<br /> to him, so that his Wife and all about him <br /> saw a visible Change, he being so chearfull, lively<br /> and happy, as they never had seen
      him before. <br /> This continued with him. He was a simple and up- <br /> right heart, and when he heard any one reason about </p>

    <p> things, he used to say: What is this to us, the
      Lamb will <br /> know it best; and again: Let us wait for our Savi- <br /> ours time, his time is allways the best. Soon af- <br />ter this his heart secretly longed to partake of The <br />
      Corpse and Blood of Jesus in the Sacrament, when <br /> unexpectedly he was sent for, and told by the B<sup>rn</sup> that <br /> our d<sup>r</sup>Saviour; who knew his hunger would soon  <br />
      accomplish his desire, and should therefo be confirmd <br /> and blessed, which made his heartvery glad and <br />more attached to the Wounds of Jesus. <em>March the 24 <br /> 1749</em>. he
      partook of the holy Communion for the 1<sup>st</sup><br /> time when his Soul and Body was so afected and pe- <br /> netrated thro &amp; thro with the martyrd Corpse &amp; <br /> blood of <a
        href=".html">Jesus</a>, as he could not express it with Words. <br /> He was so happyin his heart and felt such Blessings<br /> that he scarce knew, what he eat or drank, or how <br /> he
      walkd or workd for many days, and at this sound <br /> he felt ringing in his ears perpetually: My flesh <br /> is meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed. <br /> And indeed it proved itself
      to him real Life, and <br /> Meat and Drink to his Heart. When his Wife was <br />concernd, that she did not partake with him of the <br /> same Priviledge, he behaved very tender towards <br />
      her, and comforted her, saying: Have a little Pa- <br /> tience, for the Lambs time is the best.</p>
    <p> Several years ago he had got a Surfeit by heating <br /> himself with working over hard, which for three years <br /> past, has at times troubled him much with a <br />severe Costiveness and
      Pain in his Bowels. <br /><em>About 10 weeks ago</em> he was taken with it again <br /> but continued chearfull and quite resigned to our Sa- <br /> viour;  <a href="#mlper000648.html"
          >B<sup>r</sup> Oxlee</a> went to see him, and when he  </p>
    <p> looked at him, he found him so solid and groun- <br /> ded, and with such a Sinnerlike Shame, as he never be- <br /> fore had observed in him, So that coming home he said <br /> to his Wife:
        <a href="#mlper000562.html">Crispin Taylor</a> ripens fast for Eternity.</p>
    <p><em>Oct The 28</em>. He grew worse and could work no more. <br /> But soon after was obliged to keep his Bed. <a href="#mlper000648.html">B<sup>r</sup> Oxlee</a><br /> visited him, and asked
      him, whether he thought he <br /> should be soon well again? He answered softly (for <br /> he feard his Wife would hear him and be grieved at it) <br /> but yet very chearfully, and said: No, I
      shall go to my</p>
    <p><br /> D<sup>r</sup>Saviour, and further being asked: Whether he should <br />like to go home, he answered O yes, with all my heart<br /> and Soul; I would go this night, if it pleased him, but
      <br /> yet I'll wait till he calls me, for his time is the  <br /> best.B<sup>r</sup>&amp; S<sup>r</sup> Hauptmanns soon after came to Scholar to <br /> speak with the Communion B<sup>rn</sup>
      &amp; S<sup>rs</sup>: and calld on <br /> to see him, of which he was exceeding glad and <br /> spoke of it with great Joy. Some days after <a href="#mlper000648.html">Br<br /> Oxlee</a> came to
      see him again, and found him asleep, <br /> and as he had had no Sleep for many nights, <br /> because of his extreme pain, he would not <br /> have him disturbd. But after he got wake his
      <br /> wife told him of it. O sayd he: Why didnt you <br /> wake me, for I love the Brethren<sup>with my whole heart</sup><br /> and am very glad of their Visits, especially him, who lives
      <br /> so near me, and I am allways better after I have <br /> Seen any of them. <em>Nov: the 12</em><a href="#mlper000648.html">B<sup>r</sup> Oxlee</a> visited <br /> him again; and being asked
      to pray for him, he <br /> asked <a href="#mlper000562.html">Crispin</a>, what his heartdesired most, at <br /> which he looked up, smiled and sayd: my hearts<br />  Desire is, to be with my
        d<sup>r</sup>Saviour. He spoke <br /> but low, but one could understand and feel, what <br /> he said and according to his earnest Request </p>

    <p>B<sup>r</sup><a
        href="#mlper000648.html">Oxlee</a> recommended him to the Lambs outstrechd <br /> arms and bleeding heart with an inexpressible <br /> feeling. <em>Nov: 19</em>he grew weaker and weaker and
      <br /> being asked: If he would not take any of the Do- <br /> ctors Medicines &amp; he hereupon answered quite <br /> loud, saying: It signifies nothing, what I take, <br /> and you may give
      me, what ye will, I shall go <br /> nevertheless go to my d<sup>r</sup>Sav<sup>r</sup>. <a href="#mlper000689.html">B<sup>r</sup> Hauptmann</a><br /> has been to see me, and he has give me some-
      <br /> thing, which is better, then all the Doctors Stuff <br /> in the World, meaning the Sacrament of the Corpse <br /> and Blood of our Savr. After that his pains in- <br /> creased more and
      more, so that he could talk no <br /> more, but yet was sensible at the time. <em>Nov. <br /> the 29</em>. notwithstanding his being exceeding weak, <br /> yet his Disorder, was quite changd
      from a Severe <br /> Costiveness to a real Purging, so that there seemd <br /> to be some hope of his Recovery. They begd much <br /> that B<sup>r</sup><a href="#mlper000691.html">Hurlock</a>
      might come and see him, which <br /> he soon after did, but found him in such Cir- <br /> cumstances, that he rather despaired of his Re-<br /> covery, But he and the rest of the family were
      <br />much pleased, that he came and saw him. B<sup>r</sup><br /><a href="#mlper000648.html">Oxlee</a>, who came to see him, asked, how he found <br /> himself, he said: my Brother, perhaps I
      shall <br /> not go yet, alltho I should like it, if my dear <br /> Lamb would call me this night, for I sometimes <br /> think it long, before he fetches me, but he knows <br /> best. He was
      very resignd and notwithstanding <br /> his violent pain, he sufferd, yet he bore it pa- <br /> tiently and Scarce ever complaind. <em>Dec. 12</em>, B<sup>r</sup><br /> Oxlee visited him again
      and found him excee- <br /> ding chearfull. He laid hold of his hand, and </p>
    <p> pulld him down to him to kiss him. He told him <br /> that he took it very kind that he came so often <br /> to see him and thankd him many times for it. <br /> He was then a little easier. He
      was told that <br /><em>next Sunday</em> would be the Communion at <a href=".html">Grace- <br /> Hall</a>, of which he was very much rejoiced and glad. <br />B<sup>r</sup><a
        href="#mlper000689.html">Hauptmann</a> came to see him few days after, and <br /> spoke with him about the insuing feast of the Corpse <br /> and Blood of our Husband. He found him very <br />
      chearfull &amp; happy and very hungry after the Par- <br /> ticipation of the blessedCom- <br /> munion with the Congregation, The <em>15. Dec.</em> being Fryday at night <br /> he alterd very
      much for the worse in an instant. <br /> His Wife perceiving it, asked him, if she Should <br /> call his Children; he said: Yes. When they came <br /> in, he was in great pain, notwithstanding
      that he <br /> calld them to him, and began to speak tenderly<br /> to them, as well as his painfull Body and faulte- <br /> ring tongue would admit of. He prayd them and <br /> even charged
      them each of them with dying Words <br /> and weeping Eyes, that they should give themselves <br /> and cleave to the crucified Saviour, and then rea- <br /> ched out his trembling hand to bless
      and assure <br /> them, that if they should cleave to their Saviour<br /> he would bless them and bring them through, and <br /> You Betty with all your Children, meaning his <br /> Daughter,
      who is married. His poor weeping<br /> Wife, feeling &amp; seeing that he was going, said: <br /> Will you go &amp; leave me behind? O says he, cleave to <br /> the Saviour, cleave to the
      Saviour, and I will Soon <br /> See you again. What, when I come to him? Ay, ay, <br /> cleave to the Saviour and he will bring You thro. <br /> He gave her his Hand to confirm it with
