      <h2>Joseph Carr</h2>
      <p> our late Sing B<sup>r</sup><a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000553.html">Joseph
            							Carr</a> has left the following account of <br/> himself.</p>
      <p> I was born in <a href="#mlpla000090.html">Pudsey</a><em>Aug. the 27<sup>th</sup> 1764</em> of poor Parents &amp; baptized by the B<sup>rn</sup> at
         <br/><a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, I used constantly to
         						attend the public preachings at <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, till my <br/> Father put me
         							apprentice; <em>when I was about 13 years old</em>, to one
         								<a href=".html">Will<sup>m</sup> Harrison</a><br/> a Taylor at
         							<a href=".html">Stanningly</a>, where I got acquainted with a
         						neighbour, which <br/> proved a great detriment to me: when his wife died,
         						he used to get me to <br/> keep his house for him, as he was a shopkeeper, while he went to the markets;
         						&amp; <br/> on Sundays he would take me with him to public houses, &amp;
         						into unprofitable <br/> company, so that at last it became quite indifferent
         						to me, whether I went <br/> to any place of worship or not as my acquintance
         						cared for the expense, <br/> &amp; I began to consider myself as my own
         						master, I paid no regard to any <br/> admonitions, that were given me, but I
         						thought I had met with a very <br/> good Companion. My master in particular
         						used to tell me, that he hoped<br/> I should See the time, when I should
         							<sup>think</sup> him not my friend, but I treated this
         						<br/> observation with disregard &amp; slighted what he said, because he was
         						a <br/>methodist. When I was loose from my Master, having lived with him 7
         						<br/> Years, I continued to go in in my old course, keeping company with my
         						<br/> friend (as I then looked upon him) the above unprofitable
         						acquaintance. <br/><em>About a year after I had left my
            							Master</em>, it pleased our Savior to vi- <br/> sit me with a heavy sickness, so that no one thought I should recover. <br/> I
         						made a promise at that time, that if ever I got better again, I <br/> would
         						forsake my wicked ways &amp; turn as a poor Sinner to our Savior, <br/> but alas when I got well again, I went in as before, forgot
         						entirely <br/> my promise, &amp; associated again with my former hurtful
         						Companion. </p>
   	
   	
   	
   	
      <p> my Sister who belonged to the B<sup>rns</sup> Cong<sup>n</sup> was much grieved about me, <br/> and tried to persuade
         						me be attend the preaching at <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, when she <br/> went thither. I
         						went once with her on a Sunday in the afternoon, when <br/> I heard the late
         							B<sup>r</sup>.<a href=".html">John Miller</a> jun. read some accounts concerning the
         							In- <br/> dian Cong<sup>n</sup> in <a href=".html">North America</a>, &amp;
         						afterwards keep a Discourse. I was <br/>struck at hearing how much sooner
         						the poor Indians were brought to the <br/>
         						Knowledge of our Savior than such a
         						wicked man as myself. <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup><br/> Miller</a> came down after to see my Sister &amp; as I was at work in the same <br/>
         						room he addressed himself to me, &amp; after speaking in a friendly way
         						<br/> with me he invited me to call &amp; I see him. I went down after,
         						&amp; <br/> made known to him my desire to join the Brn
         						&amp; soon after I was <br/>received into the Society,
         						&amp; became acquainted with the Sing B<sup>rns</sup><br/> Labourer, &amp; used to spend the time between the meetings
         						in the <a href=".html">S. B<sup>rns</sup><br/> house</a>: I little expected then, that I should once come
         						&amp; live in it, <br/> as I considered it to be too high a favor for such a
         						great Sinner, <br/> as I then felt myself to be; I got leave also to come to
         						the Choir <br/> meetings on Sunday mornings,
         						which was a real blessing to me. <br/><em>March 29<sup>th</sup>
            							1790</em> I came to live in the <a href=".html">B<sup>rns</sup> house</a>; &amp; it being the passion
         <br/>
         Week I
         						attended the meetings, which made an abiding impression
         							<br/>upon my heart. <em>Dec<sup>r</sup> 14 1791</em>I got leave to be an Inhabitant
         <br/>
         of <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>to my great Joy, &amp; on the <em>26<sup>th</sup> of dec<sup>r</sup></em>Â I was received into
         <br/>
         the Cong<sup></sup> &amp;
         						since then, tho' trials have not been wanting; our Sav<sup>r</sup><br/> has sanctified them, a help'd me thro' them all, for which I cannot
         						<br/> sufficiently thank him: and I trust he will continue to lead me on
         						<br/> to the end, poor &amp; needy as I am.</p>
      <p> Thus far our late Brothers own account of himself.</p>
      <p><em>June 2<sup>d</sup> 1772</em>
         						he was Spectator at the holy Comunion, &amp; <em>aug 29<sup>th</sup></em>he</p>
      <p> he partook with us of the Comunion. For some years past
         							he has been <br/> sickly, &amp; in <em>march last</em>, it appeared as if his complaint would termi- <br/> nate in a
         							Consumption: his Laborer adds
         						concerning him: He was a Bro <br/>
         							ther  of few words, but the feeling attending what he said, as well as the
         <br/>earnestdesire, which he often expressed during his Sickness to go to our Sav<sup>r</sup>,<br/>
         						showed clearly, that he loved him: being once
         						asked, whether he thought <br/> he should see the beginning of an other
         						year? his answer was: no our Sa- <br/>
         							vior has made it clear to me, that I shall go before the next
         							Comunion. <br/> He departed gently &amp;
         						happily<em>dec<sup>r</sup> 5<sup>th</sup> 1796</em> &amp; is now at rest.</p>
      <p> In some papers found after his departure, he writes under <em>Nov<sup>r</sup> 13<sup>th</sup><br/> 1791</em>. This was a very blessed day to
         							my <sup>poor</sup> soul our Savior let me see <br/> what a thoroughly
         						depraved &amp; Spoiled Creature I am &amp; that without <br/> him I am
         						nothing but Sin &amp; misery, but thanks he to his name for <br/> the
         						blessings, which I receive from him from time to time: <em>aug 29<sup>th</sup> 1792</em><br/> I partook of the Holy Comunion for the
         						first time: I cannot express in
         <br/>
         Words, what a nearness of our Savior's love to poor Sinners I then
         <br/>
         experienced. I began the <em>year 1793</em>trusting in our Savior's merits, &amp;
         						<br/> praying him to keep me ever in remembrance of his death &amp;
         						sufferings<br/> endured on my account a poor Sinner, thanking him likewise
         						for <br/> the many favors &amp; blessings I had received at his hand in the
         						year <br/> past. <em>aug 27 1793</em> (being his
         						birth day) now I begin an other <br/> year: O Lord, be near to me, &amp; let me have thee in my mind both
         						<br/> day &amp; night, I pray. </p></body>
