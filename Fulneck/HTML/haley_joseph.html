      <h2>Joseph Haley</h2>
      <p> The life of <a href="#mlper000554.html">Joseph Haley</a> who has left the following
         						in writing <br/> I was born at <a href="#mlpla000094.html">Little Town in the Parish of Birstall in Yorkshire</a><em>June 25<sup>th</sup><br/> 1727</em>. My Parents were very poor &amp; belong'd to the
         							Church of England, <br/>  but
         							<em>before I was 11 years old</em>, I
         						was bound Prentice for the Space of 10
         						<br/> Years to a Broad Clothier, which I
         						faithfully served in <a href="#mlpla000099.html">Hardshead Parish</a>. <br/> In the
         						middle of my time <a href="#mlper000536.html">M<sup>r</sup>. Ingham</a> &amp; <a href="#mlper000640.html">Delamotte</a>
         						began to preach at <br/><a href="#mlpla000122.html">Smith House</a> &amp; <a href="#mlpla000101.html">Rawhead</a>,
         						where I often went to hear them &amp; got a lively
         <br/>
         Impression of the
         						Friend of Sinners. But my Master being a Cross old <br/> Man, he would not
         						let one go to hear the B<sup>rn</sup>,
         						and as my time was <br/> almost out, I begd our Sav<sup>r</sup> to keep me near his
         						Person. My time <br/> being out I hired myself with another Master, who was
         						a Methodist, where <br/> I became
         						more Religious than before but could never get any Satisfaction<br/> &amp;
         						my heart grewvery dead &amp; cold. At the end of my Year I went to
         <br/>
         live at <a href="#mlpla000091.html">Hallifax</a> to be an Hostler, there I plung'd myself into all manner <br/> of
         						wickedness. Soon after I went to live at <a href="#mlpla000050.html">Leeds</a> where I was a <br/>Gentlemans Servant, here I became still
         						more wicked &amp; miserable<del>being</del><br/>tho' I was always accused in my Mind &amp;
         						knowing at the same time my Course was <br/> hurtfull to body &amp; Soul, so
         						that my Life become burthensome to me.</p>
      <p> My Mother being a good old Methodist &amp; knowing
         						of my going on, <br/> She was much dissatisfied with me, &amp; often desired
         						me to come <br/> home &amp; settle to my own Business, but I found it very
         						difficult <br/> to leave my old wicked Companions, thinking I was fit for no
         						<br/> other Company. Now my Confliction was
         							broke &amp; I was befall'n <br/> with a sore Sickness, which reduced me to great poverty
         						&amp; being <br/> hardly fit for any thing, I then began to wish, that I
         						could have <br/> called back the Time I had lost &amp; Spend without our
         						Saviour.</p>
      <p> Having served in this place 4 Years and 5 Months I left my <br/> Master &amp; went to live with my Parents at <a href="#mlpla000133.html">High Town</a> but </p>
   	
   	
   	
   	
      <p> did not know what Course to take, for I was like a Spotted Bird <br/> even amongst the
         						worldly People. I went again to hear the Methodists<br/> however here I could find no comfort &amp; my poor Heart felt always
         <br/>
         dissatisfied which made me resolved to go &amp; hear the B<sup>rn</sup> but I always <br/> found Something to hinder
         						me. Soon after it happened that I <br/> went to live with <a href="#mlper000626.html">W<sup>m</sup> Taylor</a> a Single Man of
         						<a href="#mlpla000097.html">Cleckheaton</a> who belongs <br/> to the B<sup>rn</sup>. Hearing that there was a very
         						pious Minister at <a href="#mlpla000134.html">White Chapple</a><br/> I went to hear his Sermons, but as he
         							pre<sup>a</sup>ched only the Law, I soon got <br/> a
         						Dislike &amp; in the beginning of the Year <em>1757</em>
      	I went to hear <a href="#mlper000328.html">B<sup>r</sup>Pyrleaus</a><br/> who preachd on these Words: Lord, save us, we perish, there my heart
         <br/>
         was laid so hold of that I shall never forget it. Having
         						great uneasiness<br/> of Mind, I wished for an opportunity to speak with a
         							B<sup>r</sup>
         						which happened <br/> soon after to my great Satisfaction. I also got leave to come to the
         <br/>
         Classes of the Single Men &amp; in <em>March <del>the same
               							Year</del></em><em><sup>1759</sup></em> I was received into <br/> the Society, at which I
         						felt our Savr very near to me. I
         						beg'd He might <br/> keep me close to Him. I being so exposed to the
         						world made me think <br/> I should never come thro'. I often came to
         							<a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a> &amp; saw the
         								B<sup>rn</sup><br/> lived so happy together as I never saw People live before, I thought
         						<br/> I could never be rightly happy unless I was there. Yet I could never
         						<br/> offer to ask for it feeling my own Misery &amp; wickedness I thought
         						they <br/> would never allow in to come there. In this way I continued like
         						a <br/> Standing Water till <em><sup>March</sup> 1760</em> when my Master<a href="#mlper000626.html">W<sup>m</sup>. Taylor</a> got leave to
         						move <br/> into the <a href=".html">Choir House</a> which caused me many Tears thinking our Sav<sup>r</sup> had <br/>
         						left me alone to myself on account of my unfaithfulness, what would become
         						<br/> of me I did not know. As I was very uneasy &amp; being resolved to
         						become our <br/>Sav<sup>rs</sup> I
         						desired leave to live in the Cong<sup>n</sup> at <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a> which I also obtain'd
         <br/>
         &amp; moved thither<em>Oct<sup>r</sup> 20<sup>th</sup> 1760</em>very glad &amp; thankfull.
         							<em>March 23<sup>d</sup>
            							1761</em> I was <br/>received into the Cong<sup>n</sup> which was a great Blessing to me. In <em>July</em> I had <br/> a hard Sickness, in during which our Sav<sup>r</sup> gave me a
         						new Seal of </p>
      <p> my Grace Election &amp; comforted me about all past things. <em>Decr 20<sup>th</sup> 1761</em><br/> I was made a partaker of my Lords Corpse &amp; Blood in the holy Sacra <br/> ment which was an unspeakable Grace to me, &amp; I esteemed this Year <br/> a Year of Blessings bestowed upon me, which I shall never be <br/> able to express, &amp; I wish that I
         						may always have that Impression <br/> of it till our Sav<sup>r</sup> calls me
         						home to himself. Oh! could I but <br/> always prize my Call &amp; Election
         						sufficiently &amp; thank our Sav<sup>r</sup><br/> that he has granted me a nest amongst his People I cannot but <br/> be
         						ashamed that my heart does not burn more in Love towards Him. <br/> Thus far
         						his own words.</p>
      <p> In the <em>Year 1763</em>he got a Call to go to <a href="#mlpla000025.html">Bedford</a>, of which he accepted <br/> in a
         						Childlike manner &amp; served the B<sup>rn</sup> in <a href="#mlpla000025.html">Bedford</a>
         						as Cook for several <br/> Years &amp; then
         						went to <a href="#mlpla000035.html">Duckenfield</a>. On <em>March 26<sup>th</sup> 1767</em>he came again
         <br/>
         to live <a href="#mlpla000003.html">here</a> &amp; went on in a happy Course. In the
         						beginning of <em>June <br/> 1770</em>he went to <sup>live in</sup> the Oeconomy at <a href="#mlpla000059.html">Mirfield</a>. He was Naturally
         						<br/> a peevish Temper, but his plain Honest &amp; upright way of acting
         						made <br/> him beloved amongst his B<sup>rn</sup>. He was
         						free &amp; openhearted with his <br/> Labourer nor did he speak better of
         						himself than it was. He often <br/> felt the oppression of his Sickly Tabernacle, especially in the Spring and <br/> Autumn, but this last Spring
         						it soon appeared that his Sickness <br/> was a
         							Consumption &amp; that he would not recover again on which <br/>
         						account he wishd to come to <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a> &amp; go home in the Choirhouse
         <br/>
         last here, which was also granted him, <em><sup>last</sup> July the 11<sup>th</sup></em> for which he was <br/>very thankful. He spend his
         						time in the Sick Room in a true Concession <br/> with
         						our Sav<sup>r</sup>,
         						waiting with resignation for the happy Hour of his Disso-
         <br/>
         lutionwhich came to pass the 10<sup>th</sup> instant, when our Sav<sup>r</sup> took himhappily<br/> to himself as a Sinner who had found Grace in His Death and <br/> Sufferings. </p></body>
