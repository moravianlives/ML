    <h2>Rachel Brook</h2>
    <p> Our late Sr<a href="#mlper000223.html">Rachel Brook</a> was <br /> born <em>Apr. 28<sup>th</sup> 1744</em> at <a href="#mlpla000030.html">Birstol</a>. <br /> Her Parents, who loved the
      Lord<br /> directed her from her earliest <br /> years to the friend of Children <br /> and took her, when a Child to the <br /> Chaple at <a href="#mlpla000041.html">Gumersal</a>, where she at
      <br /> tended the Childrens meetings, and <br /> and used to be delighted to hear <br /> of our Saviourslove, and when <br /> comming home she would some <br /> time kneel down in a corner
      <br /> and pray to him to bless her <br /> and form her to his mind. <br /></p>
    <p><del>But</del> When she grew older she found <br /> that tender Childlike love to our <br />Savr growing cold, she wished to injoy<br /> the world, and its vain pleasures, <br /> but always
      felt a monitor within, <br /> warning her from going the broad <br /> road, which leadeth to destruction; <br /> she spent some time in great <br /><br /></p>

    <p>trouble of mind, not
      willing to <br /> follow the Lord, and full of fear<br /> to be last eternally; during this <br /> period, which was in her <em>16<sup>th</sup><br /> year</em>, she had a very remarkable <br />
      dream: it was to her as if she <br /> saw our Saviour on the Cross, in <br /> the most lovely attitude, saying <br /> to her, "all my sufferings, wounds <br /> and bruises were for thee, to
      <br /> save and redeem thy sinful soul." <br />This made a deep impression on her <br /> mind, and she turned in earnest<br /> prayer to the Lord, that he would <br /> pardon her sins and
      transgressions <br /> and renew a right spirit within <br /> her, &amp; once when walking in a field <br /> by herself, with tears and prayer <br /> lifting up her hands to him, she <br /> got
      an assurance that her guilt<br /> should be done away, and that <br /> he would prove her good Shepherd <br /><br /></p>
    <p> who seeks that which was lost <br /> with unwearied faithfulness. <br /> This has followed <sup>her</sup> all her life and <br /> often thro' grace been renewed. <br /></p>
    <p> She now felt a desire to be closer <br /> united with the Brns Cong<sup>n</sup> and <br /> to injoy the priviliges of the same. <br /><em>Oct 4<sup>th</sup> 1760</em>she moved into the <br />
        S<sup>rs</sup> House here in <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulnek</a>, <em>May 11. <br /> 1761</em>she was recd into the B<sup>rns</sup> Cong<sup>n</sup><br />and <em>May 8<sup>th</sup> the
        following year</em><br />partook for the first time of <br /> the H. Com<sup>n</sup>. She often spoke <br /> with great pleasure, of the time <br /> of her first com<del>m</del>ing, how
      happy<br /> she was in communion with our <br />Saviour, and how comfortable the <br /> S<sup>rs</sup> were together in the so called <br /> spinning days, and how they delighted<br /> midst
      great poverty in singing the <br />praises of the Lord. She was <br /> soon imployed in serving as an Over </p>

    <p>seer with the Girls, and afterwards <br />with Sisters.
      In <em>1790</em>she was accepted <br /> acoluth, and for <em>18 years</em> she held <br /> the Office of Houseservant, she <br /> showed much faithfulness in what <br /> was committed to her,
      and looked <br />upon it as a favour, which <br /> made her Office a pleasant duty. <br /><del>to her.</del> The last few years, she <br /> was not able to do as formerly <br /> but injoying the
      love of the S<sup>rs</sup><br /> they were willing to lend her a <br /> helping hand whenever required, <br /> particularly those S<sup>rs</sup> in her room <br /> showed her much love &amp;
      attention. <br /> Tho' nothing very striking seemed to <br /> distinguish her course, we are sure <br /> that she lived in communion with <br /> our Saviour, and with Childlike <br />confidence
      and humble faith looked <br /> to him for help and support in <br /> every time of need. <br /><br /></p>
    <p><em>Oct 4<sup>th</sup> 1810</em> she called to mind that <br /> it was 50 years since she moved <br /> into this house, she expressed <br /> herself that she could not suffi- <br /> ciently
      thank our Saviour, for all <br /> his love and care, his long suffering<br /> and forbearance, and for all his <br />mercy towards her, and looked back <br /> with gratitude and amazement how
      <br /> he had proved her true friends in <br /> all her spiritual and temporal <br />concerns, that she had laked <br /> nothing; and she renewed her <br /> convenant to cleave to him, to
      <br />trust his Shepherd care, till <br />hope and faith shall cease, and <br />Love prevail alone. </p>
    <p> Hitherto she had injoyed an unin- <br /> terrupted good state of health, but <br /> now she began to feel the infir- <br /> mities of age, and for these last 3 <br /> years, she was not able
      to attend </p>

    <p> the meetings as she used to do, <br /> which was a great trial to her. </p>
    <p> She was however able to go about <br /> in the house, tho' at last with <br /> great difficulty, till the <em>6<sup>th</sup><br /> of this month</em>, when she had to <br /> be confined to the
      sickroom, her <br />weakness increased rapidly; tho' <br /> she did not think that her de- <br /> parture was so near, she felt <br />resigned to our Saviours will, <br /> saying: "My times are
      in his hands <br /> "I can <del>say</del> do nothing but pray <br /> "to him to receive me, a poor <br /> "and worthless sinner, in mercy, <br /> "and I am sure he will." - </p>
    <p> On the <em>13<sup>th</sup></em>Â she called to mind the <br />blessings she had often enjoyed on <br /> that great memorial day, and <br /> particularly what she had felt the <br /> first time,
      when she celebrated it <br /> 55 years ago, during the singing of <br /> that verse: <br /></p>
    <p>O Church, how many hast thou yetWho do not love the Saviour?Who do not think his burden lightNor his sweet Yoke a favour!O ye, who don't stand well with him,Do ye long for redemption?Now, now,
      is for you the right timeCome all without exception.She spent the following days mostlyin a slumber, and when she awokebetween, <del>she</del> only complained on great weakness, she often
      foldedher hands, as being ingaged inprayers, when the lipps no morecould say; and on the 16<sup>th</sup> it pleased the Lord to call her to himself in a gentle and happymanner. Aged 71. 6 1/2
