					<p> The <roleName type="honorific">Single Sisr</roleName>
						<persName ref="#mlper000281">Han<hi rend="superscript">h</hi> Tordoff</persName> has left the following concerning her course of Life. </p>
					<p> I was born at <placeName>Houme</placeName> in the Lordship of Tong Dec<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1759
						baptiz&apos;d by the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> in my Childhood I frequented the <name event="religious">Childrens meetings</name> which prov&apos;d a great blessing to my
						heart &amp; I often prayd our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> to make me quite happy, the <orgName en="œconomy">Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Oeconomy</orgName>
						was then in <placeName>Houme Lane</placeName> where I injoyd the Love of the <orgName>Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></orgName> and had also our classes there, which were
						blest to my heart. <date when-iso="1770-03-25">March 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1770</date>, I was taken into the <orgName en="greater girls choir">great girls
							choir</orgName>, which I lookt upon as as a great favour, and got a desire to live with the <orgName>Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></orgName> which was granted me, and
							<date when-iso="1770-07-15">July 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1770</date>. I went to live in the <orgName en="œconomy">Sistrs Oeconomy</orgName> at <placeName
							ref="#mlpla000041">Gumersal</placeName>, for which I was very thankfull to our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> but finding many things to <add place="above">go</add>
						<del>come</del> thro <del>with</del> which I did not expect, it went very hard with me for some years, I had <name health="disease">not my health very well</name>, and having
						now to feel more &amp; more every day, how poor and sinfull I was by nature I stood in need of the love and forbearance of the <orgName>sist<hi rend="superscript"
							>rs</hi></orgName> and Sometimes thought I felt more then it was possible <add place="above">for me</add> to come thro&apos; with, which <del>it</del> would have been <add
							place="above">the case</add> had not my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> Slept in, &amp; thro his tender loving and kind heart towards me help&apos;d me thro, which he <del>had</del>
						<add place="above">has</add> often done and always <add place="above">prov'd</add> my friend; my forward and hasty Temper often causd me and the Sist<hi rend="superscript"
							>rs</hi> pain, and no I now begun to feel the natural corruption and deep depravity which lay in me <add place="above">and</add> being very reserv&apos;d, I did not like to
						tell it and was afraid any Body </p>

					<p> Should see it in me, I kept it as I thought undiscoverd as long as I possibly could, but at last resolv&apos;d to keep it no was longer, but tell it without reserve just as it
							<del>is</del>
						<add place="above">was,</add> I did so and found by degrees <add place="above">that</add>
						<name type="emotion">I became more chearfull</name>, and had more confidence to our dr <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>, I had a great
						desire to be <name event="reception">receiv&apos;d into the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName></name>, which favour was granted me <date
							when-iso="1776-02-11">Feb<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1776</date> to my great abasement; it was an inexpress able grace and favour to me,
							<add place="above">and</add> I went on for sometime chearfullm, and was happy in the nearness of my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> I thought then to be sure I should never feel <add place="above">myself</add> so bad as before, but alas
						this did not hold long; our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> had many things to shew me, that I had not known before, he let me see and
						feel my self in such a manner as <add place="above">to be</add> and one <del>with</del>
						<add place="above">and an entirely lost soul without him: and it</add>
						<del>out him a lost soul intirely this appear&apos;d</del> on all sides so dark &amp; Gloomy, as if I cou&apos;d not be help&apos;d, and in <name type="emotion">this sad
							state</name> I went on for sometime, till on <date when-iso="1776-11-10">Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 10<hi rend="superscript"
							>th</hi></date> I was <name office="spectator">Spectator</name> at the<name event="communion"> Holy Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></name> for this first time, this bowed
						me in the dust, and gave me a little incouragement that still our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Showed me mercy, and granted me this
						favour amidst all my Poverty, I felt a longing to injoy this highest good, but found that I was far from being clear, that my <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> had
						forgiven me everything, that there was something between him and me caus'd me great pain; in this situation I had many heavy days &amp; hours, and cou&apos;d not come in
						nightly to the Point, I wou&apos;d gladly have done somthing in my own Strength, but the more I strove, the darker I became, till at Length I could no longer <note
							type="catchword">hold</note>
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p> it out; I went alone into a room, where I fell on my knees before our <roleName type="honorific">Savr</roleName> as an undone wretch, when he was pleasd to <add place="above"
							>draw</add> near in so particular a manner, that all my distress left me in a moment, and my <name type="emotion">heart was enliven&apos;d with the sweet nearness of my
							best friend</name>, and now I felt, that he had blotted out all my sins and iniquities, but at the same time it was as if Some one said to me What thou now hast received,
						thou hast Still to carry in an earthon Vesel; thou must not lean alone on this thou must have it renewed every day and hour out of my wounded heart; This grace I shall never
						forget and must thank our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> for it even in eternity; <date when-iso="1777-05-04">May y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> 1777</date> I was <name event="reception">receivd</name> into the <orgName en="single sisters choir">Single Sist<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Choir</orgName> and on the <date when-iso="1777-05-25">25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of the same month</date> was <name office="spectator">Spectator</name>
						the last time <add place="above">at the <name event="communion">H. communion</name></add> for which I was very thankfull, and on the <date when-iso="1777-06-19">19<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of June</date>. partook for the first time of the Lords Body and Blood, in the <name event="sacrament">H Sacrament</name>; what I felt then,
						is inexpressible; therefore I must remain Silent; since that time I have seen and felt many things that are not to the mind of my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>, but thro&apos; ihs grace I have been able to come to him with every thing as a needy Sinner, who
						tho&apos; I was many times heavy and cast down on account of my inate corruption: yet found I had a mercifull <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName>, who could bear with all my infirmities; In the beggining of <date when-iso="1778-05">May 1778</date> I was seiz'd with a <name health="disease">bad
							Cold</name> which increasing in its effects made me think, I might perhaps at this time go to our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>; with which our Late <roleName type="honorific">Sistr</roleName> Closes her own account Her thoughts

					<p> Solid reflection &amp; particularly on the last moment, Which causd her some anxious concern as She was naturaly Timorous; but it was evident, that the <roleName
							type="honorific">Holy Ghost</roleName> was carying on his work in her heart in order to prepare her for her happy end; and <name health="disease">as her weakness increasd

								>Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 9</date> into the <placeName>sickroom</placeName>, where she injoy&apos;d the frequent visits of the <roleName type="honorific"

						at the same time did more on her then She was able to express, as She was of a Still turn of mind; about a week before her departure She spoke with great Clearness, how she

						herself intirely into his hands, whenever the happy moment came, which She waited for with tender Longing, till <add place="above">in</add><del>on</del> the forenoon of <date
