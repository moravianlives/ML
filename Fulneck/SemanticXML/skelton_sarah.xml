							>Fulneck</placeName> she has felt the following acco<add place="above">u</add>nt of hersilf. </p>
					<p> I was born at <placeName>Robert Town</placeName> in the parish of <placeName>Burstoll</placeName>, <placeName ref="#mlpla000084">Yorkshire</placeName> and <name event="baptism"
							>baptiz&apos;d</name> in the <orgName religion="Anglican">Ch: of Eng:</orgName> in my <date when-iso="1780" cert="medium">5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year</date> my
						Mother departed this life, my Father being left with 5 small Children, sent me to live with one of my relations; and remov&apos;d himself with the rest of the Family to
							<placeName>Pudsey</placeName>: in about a year after, he took one home again that I might have the oppertunity with the rest of the Children to go to the meetings at
							<placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName>, which I did with great pleasure for a time when <date when-iso="1785" cert="medium">I was about 10 years ould</date>, I
						begun to love the things of this world, and forgot in a great measure what I had heard of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> in the
						meetings. I then left my Father, and went to service: which indeed prov&apos;d hurtfull to me being led by others into very bad things, and following at the same time my own
						evil inclinations, but my faithfull <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> kept a gracious eye over me, and let me feel, that if I went on in this way I shou&apos;d be
						lost forever. My M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> with whome I liv&apos;d, did not like me to go to the meetings, but I intreated her one day very earnestly, she gave me leave,
						I then went to my Father and laid my case before him, and tould him, I could live there no longer, disireing him to take me home again, which he did: I then cou&apos;d go to
						the meetings at <placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulne<add place="above">ck</add></placeName> of which I was very glad <date when-iso="1788" cert="medium">in my 13th yr</date> I
						was <name event="reception">receivd</name> into the <orgName en="greater girls choir">G: Girls Choir</orgName> and from that time our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi

					<p> and wanted to be his intirely, I soon got a strong desire to go and live with the <orgName>Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></orgName>, but durst not make it known, thinking I
						was too bad; but when I cou&apos;d conceal it no longer I ventured to tell my Father, he gave me no incouragement at all: but as I cou&apos;d not give it up, I speak to my
							<name occupation="labouress" memoirSubject="no">Labouress</name> about it, who promisd not to forget me as it was a good while before I got leave to go, and I was weak and
						unsteady in mysilf; the things of this world took again hold of me, and provd a temptation to me in many respects but my dear <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> never left me, but let me feel I was not right, and <name type="emotion">causd me to be very uneasy</name> about my poor Soul, so
						that I coud do nothing but pray him to make out a way for any escape, from the many snares and temptation which were in my way.</p>
					<p>
						<date when-iso="1770-03-25">March 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1770</date> I obtaind leave to go and live with the <orgName en="single sisters choir">S. S<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi></orgName> at <placeName ref="#mlpla000041">Gumersall</placeName>, for which I was very thank full, and now it was my only desire to prosper
						in the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></orgName> to learn more of mysilf an also to become more acquainted with our <roleName type="honorific"
								>Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>. <date when-iso="1772-02-23">Feb<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1772</date> I had the favour
						to be <name event="receptionn">recievd into the <orgName en="congregation">Congr</orgName></name> which was a great comfort to me. <date when-iso="1773-05-1773">May 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> 1773</date> I was <name event="reception">receivd</name> into the <orgName en="single sisters choir">S S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Choir</orgName>; this change prov&apos;d both a blessing and a of heart to me, I felt more of my corrupted state by nature, but being very close, and not willing to be
						known as I really was: hinderd our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> work in my heart, yet I felt him constantly busy to bring me to the
						knowledge of himsilf as the Found of poor sinners, but instead of coming to him </p>
					<p> as a poor Sinner, I stood looking at mysilf so long till <name type="emotion">my misery became greater</name>, it was to me as if all the sins I had ever been guilty of, were
						laid before my eyes, and I became quite dark and perplex&apos;d: and thought I had better leave the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> then
						be known just as I was; for I thought, certainly no one has ever been like me, when I wou&apos;d have turnd to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName> it was as if something stood between, so that I knew not which way to turn for relief for my poor distressed Soul. <date when-iso="1773-11-28">Nov<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1773</date> I had the favour to be a spectator at the <name event="communion">H: Comunion</name>: which I
						took as a proof of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> love to me, that I might know he had not forgot me; even when I thought I was
						forsaken of all, and what a feeling I had of his precious nearness during that transaction, I can never describe in words; this encoraged me so that I coud go on chearfull for
						some time, but the feeling of my misery still oppressd me, for it was nor made quite dear to me that I had hinder&apos;d our <roleName type="honorifc">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi></roleName> work by my own striving, and silf? working, at the time when he wanted to bring one to a clearness in him and I felt (by the fresh discovery he gave
						me of my great misery and wretchedness) that he was now quite intent to do it, and as I cou&apos;d now do no otherwise, I disclosd my whole heart to my <name
							occupation="labouress">Labouress</name>; whome I found so tender and sympathizing that I was quite asham&apos;d. sometime after having not yet feelt our <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> forgiveness I came into darkness and confusion about it, and was not without thoughts of leaving the Congn
						being continually distress on account of my many sins, which I longd to have blotted out: and be absolvd from. </p>

					<p> in this longing disposition I once retird alone, and prostrated before our <roleName type="honorific">Savr</roleName> and he appear&apos;d before me in that bleeding figure as
						he hang upon the Cross, and gave me the asureance that he had forgiven one all my sins, <name type="emotion">this was a comfort which no words can describe</name>; thus I
						became chearfull and was thankfull for what I had injoyd. and I feelt an <name type="emotion">inexpressable desire</name> to be a participant of the <name event="communion">H:
							Communion</name>, which grace I was made a pertakes off, <date when-iso="1776-02-18">Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1776</date> to my
						great joy, from this time I gave mysilf up intirely to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>, and wish&apos;d for nothing so much as to
						live in a close connesion with him, till I shall see him face to face, - so for her own words --- Since she had the favour to be a partaker of the Body and Blood of our
							<roleName type="honorific">Savr</roleName> in the <name event="communnion">H: Commuion</name> she was very strict with hersilf: the sense she had of her own poverty made
						her always timerous, least any thing shou&apos;d creep in between our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> and her, and when ever the smallest
						thing did; she cou&apos;d never be easy till it was want&apos;d away by the Blood of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> which had once
						given her pardon: This watchfullness over hersilf prov&apos;d the means of her keeping in a close conexion with her unseen friend; she was for some years past at times <name
							health="disease">very sickly</name>, and towards the latter end of last year, she got a <name health="disease">bad cold and cough</name>; which never rightly left her
						tho&apos; severall means was try&apos;d for that purpose, <date when-iso="1778-01-18">Jan<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> 18 1778</date> she mov&apos;d to <placeName
							ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName> to see if change of air wou&apos;d not be of servise to her; but she was soon abliged to move into the Sickroom her sickness
						terminating in a <name health="disease">Consumption</name>; it was soon clear to her that our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> was
						hastening to prepare her for himsilf: and tho&apos; at times she wish&apos;d to recover, yet she soon resignd hersilf to the will of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> that he might do with her as he thought best, and so spent her time in the Sickroom in a tender childlike hearts conexion with him
						in her last days here below, she rejoic&apos;d at the happy prospect she had in view, often praying that the time might soon come, it was very agreeable to be near her the
						peace of our <roleName type="honorific">Savr</roleName> so surr ounded her, it was likewise a pleasure to her to be visited by the Sisters to whome she often tould how she
						long&apos;d to go to her everlasting rest which longing desire was happily fulfild <date type="death" cause="consumption" when-iso="1778-05-03">May ye 3d</date> in the morning
