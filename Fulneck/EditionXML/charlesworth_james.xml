					<lb/>Personalia of our late d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James Charlsworth
					<lb/>who enter'd into the Joy of his Lord July 30th 1770.
					<lb/>Our late dr Br. James Charlesworth has left the following short account
					<lb/>of some of the most remarkable particular Circumstances of his Life till
					<lb/>to the year 1753.</p>
					<p>
					<lb/>I was born at Little Gummersal in the parish of <placeName key="Birstall" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q865872">Birstal</placeName> in the 
					<lb/>County of York on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1721. And was Educated by my Parents in 
					<lb/>the principles of the Church of England, in a strict &amp; careful manner, &amp; preserv'd
					<lb/>from the Seductions w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> many <hi rend="underline">people</hi> <add place="above">youths</add> are expos'd to. When at the Age of
					<lb/>12 to 14 Years I began to keep company &amp; frequent some of the places
					<lb/>of Diversions in the World; I never <hi rend="superscript">ed</hi> do it with the same ease &amp;
					<lb/>Satisfaction w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I saw other people did, but always felt Remorse of
					<lb/>Conscience, &amp; when I was alone often pray'd to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to have Mercy
					<lb/>upon me &amp; keep &amp; preserve me from all Sin. At ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> the age of 15, I
					<lb/>left off all Pleasures &amp; became acquainted with a small Company of Mysticks
					<lb/>to whom I join'd my Self, Read their Books &amp; became very sober &amp;
					<lb/>Religious, but found my poor heart wanted something w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I had not.</p>
					<p>
					<lb/>When I was about 7 years of age (in the Year 1739) I become
					<lb/>acquainted with the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> at their first coming to Yorkshire, &amp; my dear
					<lb/>Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> made me sensible of my lost state &amp; condition, &amp; the Misery &amp; Corruption
					<lb/>of my Nature, &amp; that it was his Blood alone w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> in make me happy,
					<lb/>&amp; as such a poor Sinner. I fled for Refuge to his wounds &amp; found peace
					<lb/>thro' the Virtue &amp; power of his merits &amp; Death. In the year 1740 I went
					<lb/>to Lond<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. I staid some time w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> there, &amp; return'd again to 
					<lb/>Yorkshire the same year. I was Reced into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Decr: 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 1742
					<lb/>soon after the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> was establishd here, &amp; was admitted to be a
					<lb/>Partaker of the Body &amp; Blood of my Crucified Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> July
					<lb/>6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1743. I was Confirmd as a witness of the sufferings &amp; Atonem<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
					<lb/>of the Lamb of God by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spangenberg the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Dec the same year
					<lb/>before w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> had left my Busyness &amp; Relations &amp; went to Live at the

					<lb/>first S. B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Oeconomy at Holbeck where I continued till the 20
					<lb/>July 1744, when I was bless'd by imposition of hands to the Office of 
					<lb/>Vorsteher of the S. B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, after wch I was mostly employd in Preaching &amp;
					<lb/>visiting the young Men in the different Societies, which I continued till 1748
					<lb/>about w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> time I was obliged to engage so deeply in the Manufactory and
					<lb/>other outward affairs that I declin'd preaching, &amp; for sev<hi rend="superscript">l </hi>years together
					<lb/>went thro' a Scene of Distress in my own Mind with the External affairs
					<lb/>in w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I was engagd, however I continued <hi rend="strikethrough">therein</hi> to assist therein, &amp; went
					<lb/>several times to Holland on that Acc<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> &amp; bore a part in most of the Transac-
					<lb/>tions till the year 1753, when Ruin seem'd to threaten our whole Constitution,
					<lb/>if our <hi rend="superscript">dr</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had not miraculously interpos'd &amp;
						Inspird the d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Disciple
					<lb/>w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Courage &amp; Generosity more than Human, whereby he was enabled to
					<lb/>satisfy all the Creditors, being willing to take all the Debt upon himself
					<lb/>w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> had been Contracted without his knowledge &amp; Consent. 'Tis true I endea-
					<lb/>vour'd to hinder his engaging himself for such vast Sums of Money
					<lb/>w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> He had no visible fund to discharge withal, &amp; wo'd rather have
					<lb/>suffer'd any hardships myself, than be the occasion of Involving his
					<lb/>dr. Person, but he was Resolv'd to do it &amp; did it I dout not af the
					<lb/>Command of his Lord &amp; Master, who <hi rend="strikethrough">has</hi> indeed has miraculously
					<lb/>help'd him thro' to the wonder &amp; astonishmt of all men both Friend
					<lb/>&amp; Enemies, &amp; wch certainly among the Surprising Transactions of
					<lb/>his Life in the Kingdon of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <add place="above">will</add> see transmilted down to the 
					<lb/>latest posterity as an unparrelld act of <hi rend="strikethrough">his</hi> love &amp; faithfulness &amp;
					<lb/>Generosity to his people. with the conclusion of these dangerous
					<lb/>&amp; troublesome Affairs of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, I reckon I may also conclude
					<lb/>one period of my Life w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> probably contains pretty near the whole
					<lb/>of the mortal past &amp; when I look back how I have spent it and
					<lb/>consider that I have been almost twice seven Years in the Kingdom
					<lb/>of our <add place="above">dr</add> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, I really Blush &amp; my heart is asham'd before my
					<lb/>faithful Creator &amp; Redeemer, that I have been so little Joy to Him

					<lb/>but particularly for every thing in the year past, Thou know'st o

					<p>
					<lb/>The office w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he had in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> at Fulneck requiring
						that he
					<lb/>sho have a Helpmate, He enter'd Nov<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1754 into
						the M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> State with the
					<lb/>S S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eleanora Gutbier his present Widow, to whom he had approv'd himself
					<lb/>a faithful tender Husband, &amp; they have liv'd near 16 years together in
					<lb/>Grace &amp; Blessing.</p>
					<p>
					<lb/> In the year 1755 when the place Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> was Settled, He was
					<lb/>appointed to be the Vorsteher (or Warden) of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at the same time <add place="above">that</add> he
					<lb/>had the direction of the Manufacture, &amp; in this Office He continued till
					<lb/>it pleased our Lord to call him to his Eternal Rest.</p>
					<p>
					<lb/>From the very beginning of the Settlement here, He was particularly
					<lb/>engag'd in every undertaking &amp; till the year 1763, all the external
					<lb/>Affairs of this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> relating to the Settlement viz the Administration
					<lb/>of the Estate &amp; Buildings, were in his Hands. In this Situation
					<lb/>he had many difficulties to struggle with, &amp; felt often the Lord that
					<lb/>was upon him with much concern. From the year 1755, he was
					<lb/>not only employed in the External affairs, but He &amp; His dear wife
					<lb/>assisted in the Internal Labour. <add place="above">In 1754 He was ordain'd a</add>
					<lb/><add place="above">Deacon of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn's</hi> Church</add></p>
					<p>
					<lb/>In June 1756, he with his wife went to the Synod at Berthelsdorf
					<lb/>Tho' he was chiefly to the Service of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi> in Yorkshire, yet he was
					<lb/>also engag'd in the Affairs of Ockbrook, Duckenfield, &amp; in sundry concerns
					<lb/>of the Unity &amp; our Lord having bestow'd upon him particular Gifts &amp; Grace
					<lb/>to his Service, he remain'd active in all those matters.</p>
					<p>
					<lb/>In the Year 1757 he was appointed to be one of the Board of
					<lb/>Administation of the Affairs of the Unity in England, &amp; was usefull
					<lb/>therein, &amp; when the Oconomates Con<hi rend="superscript">fr</hi> was Settled, he was appointed

					<lb/>a member thereof &amp; continued as such till that Con<hi rend="superscript">fer</hi> ceas'd in the 
					<lb/>year 1769. Tho' his Talents in the Conducting the external <add place="above">affairs</add> were
					<lb/>known &amp; priz'd by his B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; on that account He was constantly
					<lb/>employ'd in that way, yet he also wish'd to be rather employ'd in 
					<lb/>the Internal Labour, &amp; often express'd his desire to be freed from all
					<lb/>his External engagements. In consequence of this his repeated
					<lb/>Request, He was Released in 1763 from being immediately active
					<lb/>in the Manufacture, tho' he remain'd the Counsellor in it till the
					<lb/>year 1766; when it came into another Channel.</p>
					<p>
					<lb/>Being Proprietor of the Estate, He frequently attended the Meetings
					<lb/>of the Parish for conducting the Town's Busyness, &amp; by his prudent
					<lb/>advice He gain'd the esteem of the acting persons in the Parish &amp;
					<lb/>was of Service in this point of view to the Settlement.</p>
					<p>
					<lb/>He went as Deputy of this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> to the Gen Synods at Marienborn
					<lb/>in 1764 &amp; last Year, &amp; returned from the last very infirm, tho' his disorder
					<lb/>w'd not permit him to go much about, yet he assisted in the Labour
					<lb/>in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; from this time, the publick Testimony of our Savr &amp; his

					<lb/>He had for many years past frequent Sicknesses, &amp; having a

					<lb/>inward Grief prey'd upon him, of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he was sensible &amp; wo<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>speak
					<lb/>of at times with concern. All this seem'd to impair his Body &amp;
					<lb/><hi rend="strikethrough">of the after land carnal which </hi> He often said &amp; wrote that his chief
					<lb/>Busyness &amp; concern was now to he prepar'd to leave this Body, &amp;
					<lb/>to enter into the presence of his Lord.</p>

					<lb/>Last spring He had a very severe attack of the stone Cholick
					<lb/>of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> He Recovr'd so as to be active in his Office, yet the Effects
					<lb/>were Visible. He had a second fitt of sickness with an Inflamation
					<lb/>in his Face &amp; a violent pain in his Head by w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he was confin'd
					<lb/>to his Room ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> a fortnight, but was again so well Recover'd
					<lb/>as to go about, but his Constitution was apparently weaken'd w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>
					<lb/>rais'd the apprehensions of his going home of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he spoke frequent-
					<lb/>ly with desire. He preached on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to a very large Auditory
					<lb/>with Life &amp; Energy, of the efficacious power in Jesus' Blood &amp;
					<lb/>Death to make us New Creatures, and his last meeting kept in
					<lb/>the Hall was a Discourse to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> for the
						Conclusion
					<lb/>of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Day on the W. W<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>"Shew forth his

					<lb/>in practice in Life &amp; Conversation,&amp; entreated our D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lord, kneeling
					<lb/>to happily effect it with each &amp; the whole; this has prov'd his
					<lb/>Valedictory discourse &amp; prayer for this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; the work of the 
					<lb/>Lord in general. He soon after had a Boil w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> gathered on his
					<lb/>Shoulder &amp; was attended with much pain &amp; inflam'd his Back
					<lb/>w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> threw him into a Bilious Fever. Even during his sickness
					<lb/>he shew'd his wonted paternal heart in Counsel &amp; Friedship to
					<lb/>those who came to him, as long as he had strength to speak.
					<lb/>He was tender &amp; loving to all, saying once "I have nothing against
					<lb/>any one &amp; hope no one has any thing against me.

					<lb/>we were still in hopes that by the discharge of the Abcess in
					<lb/>his Back (w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> was pretty large) his Constitution might have been
					<lb/>Reliev'd &amp; he Restor'd to Health, but on the 29th ab<hi rend="superscript">t </hi> 2 in the Morning
					<lb/>we observ'd an Alteration &amp; that the weight of his disorder was
					<lb/>fallen upon his Lungs, then it became evident that our gracious
					<lb/>Lord intended to take him soon into his Joy, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he himself expect-
					<lb/>ed wo<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be accomplished by the sametime real moving, amidst
					<lb/>his pain &amp; weakness. He spent his time in such a tender loving
					<lb/>&amp; Paternal manner towards all &amp; especially towards his dear
					<lb/>wife &amp; Niece, &amp; those by orphans to whom he had been Guardian,
					<lb/>&amp; in looking ardently to his faithful Lord in expectation of the
					<lb/>happy Moments quick approach; that it was truly edifying
					<lb/>to all who came near him.</p>
					<p>
					<lb/>After 12 o Clock in the Night he ask'd what were the Texts
					<lb/>for the Day, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> being Read as follows, the W: W<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. "My
						Soul
					<lb/>breaketh for longing that it hath unto thy Judgments at all
					<lb/>times" Feelest thou the Blood Churches ardent Longings
					<lb/>Cheek bedew'd with Million Tears forth thronging from th' 
					<lb/>enamour'd Churches Face? And the Text,. "Righteousness
					<lb/>shall be the Girdle of his Loins &amp; faithfulness the Girdle
					<lb/>of his Reins." With the whole merit of thy Life, Bless
					<lb/>us O d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lord &amp; god;" of which He took great notice, saying,
					<lb/>how comfortable &amp; pretty they were, believing confidently
					<lb/>the time drew near when Faith sho<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be turn'd into Vision.
					<lb/>when the Clock struck two, he seem'd something disappointed that he
					<lb/>was yet here, &amp; when another hour was elapesd, He look'd up in 
					<lb/>an earnest manner, &amp; expressed in his great weakness &amp; pain

					<lb/>his Desire to his d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lord, to take him to himself complaining
					<lb/>that this hour had been very long. Thus he continued looking
					<lb/>for the happy moment being quite Sensible, &amp; when He co<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>speake
					<lb/>no more, his Looks &amp; Gestures discouend the object his Soul
					<lb/>was engaged with, &amp; about half past Six his Lips turn'd Pale
					<lb/>in Jesus' Arms &amp; bosom with the Blessing of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> during
					<lb/>a blessed Liturgy. A very happy Sensation of our d<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Lord's presence
					<lb/>was felt during this Night by the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> present, &amp; many

					<p>
					<lb/>He has finish'd his course in a very blessed manner in
