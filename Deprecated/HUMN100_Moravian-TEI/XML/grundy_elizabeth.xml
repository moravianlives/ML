                  -Vo.10. G. Gd          Life           I. Holmes
                  of the widow Sr. Elizabeth Grundy, late Alvd,
                  who departed thei life at Nayldon in York-
                  shire, May the 9th 1799.
                  She has dictated the following account of her
                  life to her son, our Br. James Grundy:
                  I was born February 6. 1717. near Chowbent
                  in the parish of Leigh in Lancashire, and
                  brought up in the Presbyterian persuasion.
                  My parents were very pious, and educated their
                  children with great strictness. I was the youn-
                  gest of their daughters. Whenever I did any
                  thing amiss, my mother used to preach the Law
                  to me, which made me look upon God as an an-
                  gry Being. In my 8th year that I had the follow-
                  ing dream: I dreamed it was the day of judg-
                  ment, and I saw an innumerable multitude
                  around me. I wished to see our Savior but was
                  afraid of being seen by him; however, as I thought,
                  I moved forward, and thrust myself between 
                  two persons to have a right of him. This I had
                  no sooner done than he turned to me, as he 
                  was sitting at a table, and smiled. Hereby I was
                  to much encouraged, that I went strait up to
                  him, and now I saw two books lying before
               </p>

               <p>
                  him. One of them he opened, which I took to be the
                  book of life, as it appeared written with blood. Upon
                  this I awoke, but the dream left an impression
                  upon my mind, that our Savior was very loving
                  however, I left it again by having the law prea-
                  ched to me. Thus I spent my years of child-
                  hood like most others. I wanted to be good,
                  but could not. Still I depended much on be-
                  ing born of religious parents, as being the seed 
                  of the righteous, upon which the Presbyterians
                  of that day laid great stress.
                  My father dying in my 12th year, my mother
                  was left to care for our education, and to provide
                  for our maintenance. The latter she did by kee-
                  ping a school, and the former she performed in
                  the strictest manner, and she sometimes cor-
                  rected us very sharply, as she took Solomon’s
                  words for her rank: "He that shareth the rod,
                  hateth his son '_' Train up a child in the way
                  he should go, and when he is old he will not de-
                  part from it."
                  Before my fathers death I had a fever, which,
                  with occasional intermissions, lasted 18 weeks,
                  but I always thought I should recover. 
                  When I was 14 years old I went to nurse a child
                  of a relation; and going on to see my mother
                  our Savior drew me in to my heart on the road:

            <div type="page" n="3">

               </head>
               <p>
                  and in my prayer I addressed him as the God of
                  Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It came into my
                  mind to make a covenant with him, and then
                  being some stones in the place, I took them for
                  a witness of it. But I soon broke this covenant,
                  for getting into company I lived like others,
                  yet my conscience always condemned me.
                  Thus I formed good resolutions and as often brake
                  them again; still the Lord pursued me with
                  infinite patience.
                  In my 22nd year I comenced  commenced school keeping
                  under the inspection of the Revd. Mr. Valentine,
                  a Presbyterian Minister. He being an Arian,
                  tho not of the worst soul, I imbibed some of his
                  principles. I argued with my mother about
                  Predestination, and their great show of religion;
                  and told her, among the rest, that thou who
                  held that doctrine were hypocrites. This made
                  her examine herself, as she told me of on her
                  deathbed, thanking me for it and declaring
                  that she had found my observation true with
                  regard to herself. During her last illness she
                  felt great condemnation, all her sins appea-
                  ring to her view, which made her turn to our
                  Savior and cry out: "Dear Savior, where is
                  thy precious blood, that blood which thou did/
               </p>
            </div>
            
            <div type="page" n="4">

               </head>
               <p>
                  shed to cleanse me from my sins?" Scarce
                  had she uttered this ejaculation, when our Sa-
                  vior appeared to the eye of her faith, in his 
                  bleeding attitude, which the soldier opened his
                  side with the spear, and she felt as it were
                  his blood trickling upon her heart. Now she
                  was enabled to rejoin in God our Savior. Short
                  ly before her end she said: "Come, Lord Jesus,
                  come quickly," and then fell asleep in Jesus
                  with a lovely smile upon her countenance.
                  Her happily departure made so deep an impres-
                  sion upon me that I could never forget it,
                  at the same time begetting a strong desire
                  within me, to profess real religion; but to
                  this the vanities of the world proved a great
                  hindrance. Nevertheless, my mind was strong-
                  ly convicted of my folly; one night in par-
                  ticular, which at a dance, I was so terrified, 
                  that I was obliged to withdraw, being struck
                  with the reflection, what would become
                  of me, if I should be cut off in that state.
                  Another time I was so alarmed at my situation
                  that I went to the above mentioned minister
                  after midnight and called him up; but he told
                  me that I had nothing to fear, as I had always
                  been a good woman, and that God was merciful
                  and would not mark iniquity so strictly.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Thus I was rightly served for having applied
                  to him instead of our Savior. I expected he would
                  have put me in the way of doing something
                  whereby to merit heaven; but instead of this,
                  he addressed me to put it off by going into cheer-
                  ful company, lest I should grow melancholy.
                  I foolishly took his advice, endeavoring to shake
                  off conviction as much as possible. In this
                  way I proceeded till I was married, and even
                  after that, for a while, followed the fashions of
                  the world. But, my husband, being a religious 
                  member of the church of England, protested against
                  that mode of living. His Minister being an un-
                  awakened man and performing divine service
                  only in the morning, we went in the afternoon
                  to a Baptist chapel. Under a sermon in that
                  place on the words: "Almost thou persuadest
                  me to be a Christian," we were both so affected
                  that we wept, which the Minister showed, how far
                  a person may go, and yet be only almost a
                  christian. We continued to hear him till the
                  birth of my first child, when he wanted to per-
                  suade us not to have it baptized, to which my
                  husband would by no means agree. My hus-
                  band read frequently in the New Testament
                  and when he loved the book, used to say : "I

                  thank God for Paul's Epistles; best this of
                  my taste at that to live, for I would rather 
                  read of Goliath, Lampoon, Joseph, he's brethren
                  on of battles; however he continued reading 
                  Paul's Epistles, without minding one.
                  My husband being an officer is the exercise
                  his duty was frequently too hard for, so
                  that he was often ailing. In January 1749.
                  he ever taken seriously ill, and sent, that
                  he should like to deposit, adding, thou am
                  happy, who can soon leave the world in
                  peace.  I complained that he had lost
                  his regard for me, but he assured me,
                  that his love for me was not decreased;
                  but he saw nothing in this world worth existing
                  to stay in it for. I then asked him,
                  'whether he was first to leave?' He replied,
                  "All my fitness is what Jesus Christ did for
                  we on the cross." This I did not then under-
                  stand. In that state of heart he departed,
                  which was accompanied with such a happy
                  feeling, as filled me with astonishment.
                  His death took place Feb. 22, 1748. In the
                  29th year of his age.
                  After his Departure, their words: "I will be
                  a husband to the widow, and a father to the fa-
                  therly", were interpreted upon my mind; you

                  I was full of disbelief and not say, "Thy
                  will be done." Then I was left with out house
                  or home, having one child, called William, and 
                  far advanced in pregnancy with another. I 
                  soon set off for my native plan, which was
                  200 miles different, and travelled on foot nine 
                  days, in frost and snow. On the arrival at
                  the home of one of my sisters, my husband's
                  father sent for me and took me into his 
                  family.  Here I was in about three weeks
                  brought to bed of my son, James, with whom
                  I now live, and who is a member of the brother
                  church and one of their preachers.
                  After the birth of my son, confidently that 
                  he had now no father to care for him, it was
                  as tho' our savior stood at my bed side and com-
                  forted me. I laid my hand on the childs'
                  head and devoted him to the Loved and his ser-
                  vice and to the entirety his. This ever accom-
                  panied with the deepest sensation I had ever 
                  had of the presence of Jesus, and yet it was
                  as if he said to me, "Thou does not know me
                  yet." Indeed I did not know him, even by the 
                  name of Jesus, but only as the God of Abra-
                  ham, Isaac and Jacob; and when I did a-
                  gain and again, I found no comfort; but

                  at last, it was impressed on end to call
                  when Jesus, which I did, saying, "Lend Jesus
                  have mercy upon me!" No sooner had I cal-
                  led upon him by that name, them my condem-
                  nation was all taken away, and I rejoiced
                  wondering at there at the same time, that I had read
                  my Bible so often, and had never called u-
                  pon Jesus before. Now then words came
                  into my mind, "He shall be called Jesus, for
                  he shall save his people from their sins, and
                  I rejoiced in God my Savior.  This impression 
                  was so deeply fixed in my heart, that when  
                  relieving to rest, I always looked to him in
                  spirit on hanging of, on the cross.
                  For sometime after, I had been concerned 
                  for my salvation, and now I felt delirious 
                  to be connected with a people of God. In
                  this view I went to bear the Methodists, loo-
                  king upon the, as a people of God.  I read
                  Mr. Whitfield's Sermon and saved several
                  of Mr. Wesley's preachers. I joined the Me-
                  thodists, and with great Zeal frequented their
                  meetings tho I had sometimes to walk
                  four miles in the dark. But by and bye,
                  observing how they differed among themselves
                  about points of doctrine, I left them,
                  thinking they were not a people of God.

                  because they were not of one heart and mind.
                  About this time I heard of the Brethren,
                  getting my first impressions of them by 
                  means of their hymn book of which I was ve-
                  ry fond, especially of that hymn: 
                  "O tell me no more of this world's veins story;
                  The time for such trifles with me now is o'er.
                  I wished much to know, where to find thou
                  people, who had published their hymns. At
                  lengths I learned that they had a chapel in
                  Dierkenfield, and that they were expected
                  soon to preach at a home in Thackerley, a
                  with different from when I live. I waited
                  with the greatest pleasure and satisfaction  
                  and spent the whole day in his company.
                  Indeed I received him in another Apostle
                  Paul.  Immediately thought, "this people
                  shall be my people, their God my God, with 
                  them. I will live and die and be buried"; and 
                  of this resolution I never repented. This
                  was fulfilled what my dear late mother
                  said to me, shortly before her departure
                  for calling me alone to her bedside she said: 
                  "I have waited with our savior, and was

                  assured that thou shall be his and belong to the
                  people of God, but what people and where and 
                  when I cannot tell; but it will not be yet; 
                  After this Mr. Valentine, the abovementioned
                  Arian Minister, told me, I had changed for the
                  women by joining the Brother. I sent him the 
                  nine discourses on Christ's Divinity, by Count
                  Zinzendorf; but they did not please him. Soon
                  after he fell sick; I felt great concern for
                  him and went often to converse with him.
                  whenever I mentioned anything about the 
                  discourses I sent him, he was out of patience
                  and desired me to visit him no more; neverthe-
                  less, I told him, that I was concerned for him
                  and should call again to see him.  However
                  stayed away for sometime, but hearing that
                  he grew very weak, I resolved to visit him a-
                  gain, as I felt very anxious about his happi-
                  ness. Coming to his home I was informed by
                  his daughter, that he endured her to suffer
                  more to come to him, not even his own chil-
                  dren.  I therefore sent my love to him, which
                  was ongoing after his health.  This being deli-
                  vered, he desired his daughter to send me to him,
                  as he wished to see me.  When I came to his
                  bed side, he put out his hands to me, and ap-
                  peared like an affectionate, loving child, and 
                  said "We have had many arguments, but

                  now I know that Jesus Christ is my Savior." I re-
                  plied. " He is a Savior to them that believe." To
                  this he replied: "I do believe, and I have no me-
                  rit of my own; but trust alone in my Savi-
                  or's death and merits. There is something to
                  go through in death, but the prophet beyond it
                  is bright; but I cannot say much, I was very
                  weak. "We then took a tender leave of each other,
                  and soon after he departed in peace.
                  My oldest son, William, died the same year,
                  after a long illness.  Shortly before his departure,
                  being very sensible of his approaching dissolution, 
                  he called on to his bed, expected his desire to
                  go to Jesus, bade each other farewell, and looked his 
                  eyes and fell happily asleep in the Lord, in 
                  the 7th year of his age. 
                  In 1755 a congregation of the Brother was settled at
                  Dierkenfield, at which solemnity I was profound
                  and my heart was offered like that of Lydia.
                  From that time connection with the church of 
                  the Brethren became very weighty to me and has re-
                  mained so ever since, one which account I was
                  the more greived at not being received a mem-
                  ber of them; this favour was, however,
                  granted me the year following.
                  At Thackeray, I opened a little shop for my man
                  and had a good prophet of doing well;
                  but feeling my heart in danger of being drawn

                  away by worldly prosperity, and being afraid of
                  losing by any means that happiness, which
                  was then and has been ever since of the last im-
                  portance to me, I gave my shopkeeping in the
                  midst of prosperity, and these words of our savior
                  followed me continually, "What shall it profit
                  a man, tho' he gains the whole world and loves
                  his own soul." And I think it would because
                  for many, even members of the Brethren church, 
                  of this was barely considered. I can say with
                  truth, that from that day to this, our savior,
                  and fellowship with his people have been more
                  important to me than anything else in
                  the world.
               </p>
               <p>
                  In August 1756. I moved to Dukenfield, as
                  a member of that congregation. Here I found it very
                  difficult to come through. I had not only to go
                  twenty miles for the work, by which I earned a
                  livelihood, but the necessities of life, parti-
                  cularly bread ran to double the price, they had
                  been sold for a fifth before. Yet I never re-
                  pented of having moved hither, but was con-
                  tent and happy with a small portion of
                  very mean, fare; and my son, who was now
                  nine years old, was the same. Our savior
                  abundantly blessed us internally, and we
                  spent our time, while at work, with singing
                  of Him and his sufferings, being enabled to
                  take our refuge to him in all our circumstances.

               <p>
                  When things were at the worst we would sing:
                  "As small birds are - a hole to cheer
                  In hollow trees for cover,
                  When whirlwinds blow - when hail and snow
                  O'er man and beast do hover:
                  So I to then, - Lord Christ, do flee,
                  Within thy wounds retired;
                  When sin and death - did stop my breath,
                  Here I again reposed."
                  This time was indeed a blessed period.
                  In January 1758. I had the favour to par-
                  take of the H.C. for the first time in the
                  Brethren church. I felt so unworthy of it, that
                  I hardly durst venture;
                  "Heav'nly joy and holy trembling
                  I felt in me past dissembling."
                  This divine repast proved a great blessing to me.
                  Hitherto I had been in a certain rapturous
                  way, which in some measure was there more
                  looked for, them a sinners' believing reliance
                  on the all sufficient merit and atonement
                  of Christ. I had made a fine covenant with
                  our savior to be his in all circumstances, both
                  adverse and prosperous, not questioning but I
                  could stand any trial, for I fear, that he had
                  possession of my heart, and I had an assurance
                  that he would safely lead me. Not withstand-

                  ding this I had soon after a severe trial, which
                  was augmented by my want of self knowledge.
                  Falling sick and feeling myself very poor, and full
                  of unbelief, I began to question the love of our
                  Savior, thinking, if the Lord be with me, why
                  am I thus? Hitherto I had imagined that belie-
                  vers had a fund of support within themselves,
                  so that I thought, it was inconsistent with a 
                  child of God to have any doubts and fears. Thus
                  I was so confounded as to be almost driven to
                  despair, and because like a shipwrecked mariner,
                  thrown at once from the pleasing prosperity
                  the promised land upon a desolate rock, where
                  nothing appeared but horror &amp; devastation.
                  The gloom, which had thus overspread me, con-
                  tinued a good while, and tho' I had frequent
                  visits from our Savior, still I could not re-
                  gain my cheerfulness, for I had not yet lear-
                  ned to cleave daily by faith as a needy sinner
                  to Jesus. Indeed this point was not then so
                  well moderated by some of us, as it has been
                  since; After it was expected that a child of God
                  should be cheerful and happy without any in-
                  terruption, and this idea afforded me suffici-
                  ent cause for self condemnation. But since
                  then I have learned to know more of the
                  privilege, enjoyed by a believer, of turning
                  with all his selfishness, to our Savior and finding

                  in him a present help in time of need, which
                  is an inexhaustible fund, where we may take
                  grace for grace, and not look for it in any
                  of our own attainments.
                  Some time after I was appointed to begin
                  a school for girls in Dukenfield, which
                  gave me great confidence in our Savior,
                  considering it as an answer to my prayer;
                  for I was at times so full of unbelief, that
                  I thought myself beneath his notice. I opened
                  this school with eleven girls, children of some
                  of the Brethren church, and continued it fifteen
                  years. This was a happy period both for me
                  and the children, several of the latter after-
                  wards became members of the Congregation and
                  likewise some of their parents.
                  At length, not being able to procure a proper
                  place for my school, and having to give up the
                  hours I had hitherto occupied, I was, to my
                  great grief, obliged to drop it. In conse-
                  quence of various disagreeable occurrences,
                  it appeared as if the time for my conti-
                  nuing the school was over.
                  About this time my son, whom from his
                  birth I had entirely devoted to our Savior,
                  moved into the Brethren house in Dukenfield,

                  in the year 1760, and in 1766. He went to Ful-
                  neck, This last removal went very near me,
                  but I durst not stand in our Savior's way, be-
                  lieving it would be for the best.
                  Having lodged for sometime with a private
                  family [at some distance] from Dukenfield, who behaved very
                  well to me, I began to grow tired of having
                  so far to go to the meeting. I therefore,
                  sought leave to live in Fulneck, which I
                  obtained. I went thither in 1778, and lodged
                  as a visitor in the widow's house. Here I had
                  to learn a new business, for the sake of earn-
                  ing a livelihood, which made it heavy
                  to me in the beginning, and I was at times
                  unhappy in my mind. But the chief reason
                  of all my distress was, that I did not in every
                  circumstance turn as a poor sinner to our Sav-
                  ior; He, However, at length, enabled me, con-
                  confidently to come to him, as my unchangea-
                  ble friend, who had always approved himself
                  to me as my merciful Believer and Savior.
                  I was much assisted at this time by the
                  advice given me by a certain Brother, who
                  with the tenderness of a father encoura-
                  ged me, assuring me that I would gradu-
                  ally regain my wounded cheerfulness; and
                  this I found verified. But what gave me
                  comfort above all other things, in my greatest

                  trials, was the imperfection that my Savior had
                  died for me, and this, I trust will remain so
                  unto the end. I say indeed from my inmost soul:
                  "His death and passion ever,
                  Till soul and body sever,
                  Shall in my heart engraved remain."
                  This has been indelibly impressed upon my
                  mind, ever since he first manifested himself
                  to my soul as my Redeemer.
                  In May 1780. my son received a call to begin
                  a school and care for the Brethren Society in
                  Bayldon. In consequence of this he married.
                  My daughter in less growing consumption after
                  her first delivery, moved for her health to her pa-
                  rents in Huddersfield, where she departed this
                  life, and the child soon followed her into eternity.
                  I therefore went to live with my son in Octo-
                  ber 1787. and began a school for girls; and in
                  this situation I have remained till now, when
                  I live in daily expectation to be dismissed
                  from all labour and sorrow, eternally to rest
                  and rejoice in the presence of my God &amp; Savior.
                  In this place a new period in my life com-
                  menced, and I learned to know, more than ever,
                  that I must lean on my Savior, and him only.
                  It was clear to me that I had a call to Bayl-
                  don, and that I was in my proper place when
                  teaching school; our Savior who often visited

                  me and blessed my endeavors. I became more
                  stripped of my self righteousness, and learned to 
                  rely more fully on the merit and faithfulness
                  of Jesus, in all circumstances for which I 
                  can never thank him sufficiently. Neverthe-
                  less I now and then got into a way of self  
                  , which caused me no small anxiety:
                  but my all merciful Savior has helped me
                  and been very gracious to me, amid it all
                  my infirmities of soul and body. I have often
                  been troubled with needless perplexities when 
                  reflecting on old age, and how I should get a 
                  maintenance in that case; for I was always
                  afraid of being burdensome; which I have never
                  been to anyone, not even when I had two 
                  children to support by my own hand-labour.
                  But in this respect also the Lord has been
                  better than my fears and put me to shame,
                  by prospering my endeavors, so that I have
                  more abundance now in my 83rd year, than 
                  I have has at any time, since I became 
                  a widow, which is 51 years: and I cannot
                  but acknowledge it as a singular favor,
                  that I am able, tho' in much weakness,
                  to teach children as well as ever in any 
                  part of my life; so that my old age has
                  been signally favored with respect both 
                  to external and internals; for which I

                  tude to my Savior.
                  The above account of her life she dictated
                  to her Son a short time before her end.
                  She was mind beloved and respected by all who
                  knew her both here and at Duckenfield, and
                  had proved a blessing to many. Soon after her 
                  arrival at Bayldon, she heard of an old lady,
                  in one of whose tenements we had our former
                  meeting place, one of our Brethren occupy-
                  ing the house; but being unfriendly and pre
                  judiced against us. she gave us warning to 
                  quit the premises, which proved the occasions
                  of our building the present small chapel
                  and schoolhouse. Our late sister verified this
                  lady and by means of her conversations gained
                  her entire affection and confidence. The old
                  lady became sensible of her lost condition, 
                  sought for grace a the commission of sins
                  thro' the atoning blood of Jesus, which she
                  also found and departed this life in peace.
                  She was greatly interested in the prosperity
                  of the Society at Bayldon, and when her son

                  labours, as for some years there had been no in-
                  crease to the Society, but rather a diminution
                  in member, owing to the departure of several
                  of the first member; she animated them to 
                  do their part faithfully, saying the Lord would
                  not be wanting on his side, adding: "You will
                  see (better) brighter Days, after I am gone."*.

                  At the funeral oration, previous to their-
                  terment, which I was favoured to Deliver on
                  May 15. 1799. I had the please to see
                  all the seats in the chapel occupied, tho'
                  it was at the early hour of 7 in the morn-
                  ing, to gain time for conveying her re-
                  mains to Fulneck, where she wished to be
                  interred, and which is at the distance of

                        She had for many years been troubled with a

                        of natural rest; yet she never murmured,

                        The Society also increased. A few weeks after 
                        her Departure 8 new members were added to 
                        the same. At her Death their number was 17.
                        exactly as many as she found in connexi-
                        on with the Brethren, other find coming
                        to Bayldon. And when I left Yorkshire
                        in 1804, their  number was between 40&lt;50.
                           and I learn by letters that they continued to
                           increase in number and grace.

                        in the evening she found breathing very diffi-
                        cult. Her son looking at her with earnest con-
                        cern, she turned her eyes to him, as it were, to 
                        comfort him and said:
                        <lb/>
                        "Tho' waves and storming o'er my head,
                        Tho health a strength a friend, be gone,
                        Shortness of breath preventing her from fini-
                        shing this her favourite verse, she said to her son, Go on; which he did as follows:
                        <lb/>
                        "Tho' joys be withered ill and fled,
                        Tho' every comfort be with withdrawn;
                        Stedfast on this my soul relies,
                        Jesus, thy mercy never dies."
                        <lb/>
                        She joined in the last lines, and then said, 
                        that is it. For sometimes after this she 
                        continued labouring under great difficulty 
                        of breathing, and at length was very desi-

                        When put again into her own bed, she prayed
                        intimately: "Dear Savior, come and fetch me
                        thy poor sinner home; come, Dear Savior,
                        and fetch me." Soon after this her son
                        thought she had been asleep, but her breath
                        grew shorter and shorter. Thus she expired 
                        in the most gentle and peaceful in manner
                        and went over to see him, whom here she
                        loved, and whom she also served to the ut-
                        most of her power, with great faithfulness
                        Her pilgrimage here below lasted 82 years
                        3 months and 3 days.

                        "She is now with the Son at home;
                        Bow humble expectation
                        Is, that he'll let us also come,
                        To join that congregation."
