               <p>The course of Life of <persName ref="#mlper000219">Abigal Bently</persName> I was born at <placeName>Wike in the Parish of Barstel</placeName> <date when-iso="1722-05-23">April y<hi
                        rend="superscript">e</hi> 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1722</date> my Parrents was of the <orgName>Church of England</orgName> and brought me up in the same, as far as I can
                  remember my first thought of being fared was thro' hereing my <persName>Mother</persName> speak with another what time Children begun to be anserable for Sin and they thought at
                  Seven-years, this had such an impression on my mind that I often went alone and wish'd <persName type="deity">God</persName> wou'd let me die before that time for then I took it for
                  granted I should be saved, <date when-iso="1729" cert="medium">when I was about Seven Years</date> I began to be <name type="emotion">afraid</name> of dying, my Parrents strove to
                  preserve me as far as there circumstances permitted them, <date when-iso="1733">in my Eleventh year</date> I was sent to live with a Neighbour where I heard and saw all sorts of bad
                  things had not our dear <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> had a perticular Hand over me I should have been ruined in Soul and Body, when I was there they sent me into a
                  Feild to work where I was so cold that I had no feeling of Hands nor Fat nor could I come to any House, all on a sudden it came in my mind that <hi rend="superscript"><persName
                        type="deity">God</persName></hi> could warm me and I grew directly warm this was the first time I <del>know</del> thot <persName type="deity">God</persName> could here us
                     <del>or know </del> or know any thing of us after some time I left this place and removed into a nother <del>place</del> that was more agreable, here I took much to reading and
                  intended to be very good, but amidst it all I ataind to no satisfaction but a constant condemnation follow'd me with every thing I did, so far her own <del>words</del>
                  <hi rend="superscript">writing</hi> about this time she began to hear <persName>Mr Igham</persName> and when the societys of the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>
                  was sitled <del>she</del> was me of the first of that number when the S S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Oconomy was seteld at <placeName>Oxhaire</placeName> she after some time had
                  leave to be one of them where she continued for <del>some time</del>
                  <hi rend="superscript">a while</hi> but her being of a very League turn made it very <hi rend="superscript">heavy</hi> for her amidst of the <orgName>Sisters</orgName></p>

                     congregation</name> and as it coud not be perciev'd that she got any satisfaction in her Heart the Labours thought it more proper for her to go and live with two or three
                     <roleName en="honorific">Sisters</roleName> who' was under the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi></orgName> care which she took very much to heart and could hardly be
                  persuaded to do as was however thought for the best <del>and</del> she took it so very near that it brought on a <name health="disease">violent sickness</name> for <hi
                     rend="superscript">us</hi> she her self express &amp; it coud never bear to be Defard of the fellowship of living in the midst of <orgName>Sisters</orgName>, and yet at the same
                  she was in her heart very dry and her being so very self righteous <del>was</del> made it very heavy for her to fell as a Sinner depart alone upon our <roleName type="honorific"
                     >Saviour</roleName> and this has been ameans of her course being some what heavy in the Congregation, and so she continued removeing for some time from place to place to place by
                  the direction of the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> when at last she got leave to go and live with some <orgName>Sisters</orgName> at the Home where she
                     <del>at</del> began to <name health="recovered">feel a little more of her self</name> and was brought in to very great <name type="emotion">concern</name> about her Salvation but
                  as she was once coming from a meeting this verse was perticularly aplyd to her Heart, Out of pure grace unmerited, Salvation show'rs on our Head Merely because the <roleName

                  made sure of her Election * when the <placeName>Choir House</placeName> was begun at <placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName> she with some others Out of the <orgName

                  <del>Mortimer</del> to remove with them to that in <placeName>Pudsey</placeName>, but here it she did not spend her time so <name type="emotion">chearfully</name> as could have been

               <p>for she lost many happy hours for her own heart thro' looking so much at others and being so very strict with her self she could not easily look over things that some times accord

                  entirely broken up, and so she with the rest of her <orgName>Sisters</orgName> came here into this House where she continued very <name type="emotion">chearfull</name> for some time
                  and cou'd not express her self enough of the joy She felt that she was now got to her right home, but thro' her very strict way of thinking she brought her self into <del>many</del>
