					<l>Sojourning here were drawing to the end, &amp; wod say with vettedness the sooner the better</l>
					<l>&amp; as he had not much Sickness &amp; He thought sometimes he might continue a long time, but</l>
					<l>a Fortnight ages he was oblig&apos;d to take his Bed, altho he was not inclin&apos;d to</l>
					<l>speak much, yet nor of the experience he had of our Savr yet it was evident our Savr</l>
					<l>was his object &amp; his heart liv&apos;d in a Connection with him, his son observes, &quot;I had</l>
					<l>occasion to be asham&apos;d of myself when I found how near a Connexion he had with our</l>
					<l>Savr &amp; says farther I shall had many happy hours with him in his Sickness wch</l>
					<l>I shall never forget especially in 2 or 3 of his last Days, when he wish&apos;d that our</l>
					<l>Savr wod come soon &amp; fetch him home. His daughter &amp; Grand Daughter came to see</l>
					<l>him, &amp; at taking leave of him, his Son being present &amp; He look&apos;d at them &amp; said</l>
					<l>I have no other Council to give you but that ye Love our Savr &amp; one another,</l>
					<l>w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> his son says melted my heart to hear that from Him. I thought it was something</l>
					<l>like <add place="above">what</add> the Apostle John said <add place="above">viz</add> little Childr<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Love one another. He took tender leave</l>
					<l>of one of another of his Family who came to see him, &amp; chiefly was occupied in his</l>
					<l>Thoughts of being soon at home with the Lord waiting for the happy moment</l>

						home she gave one a Verse to Sing for</l>
					<l>her, but I cannot sing none, I have heard often of Brns Joining with the singing</l>
					<l>when they was blessd for going home with a strong voice but I cannot.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>In the Evening B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lyons Visited him again, &amp; spoke with him once <add place="above">more</add> of that happy</l>
					<l>change w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> now drew near, then bless&apos;d him for his departure during the Sing<hi rend="superscript">g</hi>. So go</l>
					<l>then go dear heart &amp; hide &amp;c &amp; some other Verses with a very happy Sensation of our</l>
					<l>he offered &amp; ask&apos;d him if he had understood what was said &amp; Sung, he said I feel it.</l>
					<l>Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> near presence. <add place="above">he ask'd him if he had understood what was said &amp; sung. He said feel it</add> He after<hi rend="superscript">w</hi> said to his Son I shall soon be in a very happy</l>
					<l>place, but continued in extream pains all Nlight till abt 5 oClock Monday Morning</l>
					<l>when his pains seem&apos;d to abate a little, &amp; he cod breathe easier, he lay compos&apos;d with</l>
					<l>an extraordinary clearness in his Countenance &amp; Eyes then Slept quite calmly for</l>
					<l>an hour, then opening his Eyes he looked very earnestly at his Son, but clos&apos;d them</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>soon again in <hi rend="strikethrough">happy</hi> final Sleep breathing his last without the least</l>
					<l>his Son says It was a happy hour to one during his Sleep &amp; departure tho</l>
					<l>I never shall forget Our Savr and so <add place="above">very</add> near my heart that I cannot express</l>
					<l>&amp; am thankful to all the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> for all their Love &amp; faithfulness toward</l>
					<l>him. Our vunerable B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> has thus cls&apos;d the time of his abode below in</l>
					<l>very blessed manner wch has lasted 77 Years &amp; 6 months.</l></lg></p>
