			<p>
            <lb/>The Cour of Life of the Single Sister Anna Shoesmith
            <lb/>I was born  NorthernGreen in the parish of Halifax Aug<hi rend="superscript:true;">st</hi> 13 1752 and
            <lb/>Baptz by B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> in the year 1758 I removed with my parents to
            <lb/>Fulneck, I of uncommon Light turn of mind caused much
            <lb/>dissatisfaction to my dear parents dureing the course of years spent w<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi>
            <lb/>them and also deprived my self of many priviledges amongest
            <lb/>the Children which might aprove'd about blessing to my own 
            <lb/>Heart and a comfort &amp; joy to those about me; but my bad conduct soon overcame
            <lb/>me Especial if my parents forebore there reprove my trouble was presumably
            <lb/>at an End. Thus I spent my time March 1764 when I was took into the
            <lb/>Great Girls Choir from which time I begd my parents to get me leave to
            <lb/>live in the choirhouse they told me many circumstances of my unfitness
            <lb/>&amp; desired me to intreat our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> for Grace &amp; solidness of Heart to get more
            <lb/>deeply Ground in the knowledg of My self and want of Him. this made.
            <lb/>a real impression for a Time upon me &amp; caused me to turn to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to beg him
            <lb/>in my prayers to allow &amp; prepare my heart to be more to his mind in all my
            <lb/>ways, and on overhearing my parent saying to Each other that
            <lb/>I had leave to live in the choirhouse the rejoiced me very much &amp;
            <lb/>made me turn with Earnestness of Heart to our d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to preserve and keep
            <lb/>me to the End of all my Days &amp; in a fortnight Time I had the Grace to
            <lb/>remove into the choirhouse &amp; continued for some time chereful &amp; happy
            <lb/>but this injoyment lasted not long, for I became dry &amp; indifferent to
            <lb/>every thing that was Good and ordorly for a Child of God one in my Situation &amp;
            <lb/>great unEaseyness of Heart was My daily course Esspecialy on seeing
            <lb/>first one &amp; then another of my room companions made partakers of the
            <lb/>congregation My perplexations increased &amp; my hearts distress
            <lb/>was quite unbearable but this Lasted not long for I took my own
            <lb/>means &amp; method to make of bearable by thinking lightly &amp; indiffrent over
            <lb/>every thing that was a blessing to a Child of God, yet amidst all this </p><pb facs="#facs_2" n="2"/><p>
            <lb/>unhappy condition my Gracious Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> kept his hand upon me and 
            <lb/>drew me as with Cords <hi rend="strikethrough:true;">of Love</hi> so that I cou'd no longer withhold
            <lb/>my heart from his love &amp; mercy &amp; felt Liberty to out my
            <lb/>woes &amp; wants with a Thousand Tears, conf found him
            <lb/>whom My soul so much wanted in this &amp; meltedness
            <lb/>of Heart my Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> blest &amp; comfortd me as his pardond one &amp; I became his
            <lb/>poor needy &amp; dependant Creature, &amp; by the first opertunity I pourd
            <lb/>out my heart into my Labourer who begd me to keep close to
            <lb/>to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> <hi rend="strikethrough:true;">as his</hi> &amp; often keep band with him over all
            <lb/>my wants &amp; I might be sure of having a Happy course during
            <lb/>all future years. July 17<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1768 I had the Grace to be receivd into the
            <lb/>congregation, which rejoicd me very much but my body and
            <lb/>Light turn of mind deprived me of making the best use of the solid
            <lb/>council &amp; advice given by the Sisters to me &amp; cou'd rather be drawn
            <lb/>to follow those of my own turn of mind then otherwise be perswaded
            <lb/>to seek for Solidness &amp; stability of heart, this fare her own dictating
            <lb/>in The Year 1772 our happily departed Sister was received into the
            <lb/>Single Sisters Choir this made a change for some little Time &amp; she
            <lb/>was moved into a Sisters Room but it was presently perceptible
            <lb/>that Her course &amp; companions therein was of an unprofitable
            <lb/>&amp; painful Consequence yet nothing could preswade Her from it
            <lb/><hi rend="strikethrough:true;">beleaving all friendship</hi> suffering herself to be thus insnar'd
            <lb/>Soul of its maker nurture from affection to
            <lb/>She &amp; deprived her Heart <hi rend="strikethrough:true;">of the</hi> only schooling of the H Spirit
            <lb/>&amp; in this infatuation of pretended friendship she spent Her
            <lb/>Latter years &amp; a weakly habbit of body brought on a perceptible
            <lb/>decline of Strengths so that in the beginning of the
            <lb/>year 72 she was obliged to remove into the sick room where
            <lb/>a more real sence of her Hearts situation became more Her
            <lb/>object of concern and our d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> in Mercie vouchsafeth her
            <lb/>many gracious visits &amp; she has his needy one turnd to him
            <lb/>with Heart &amp; soul <hi rend="strikethrough:true;">inamourd with His Mercies</hi> she Earnestly</p><pb facs="#facs_3" n="3"/><p>
            <lb/>sought for Grace as a needy Sinner &amp; bore her weakly Tabernacle
            <lb/>with Great patience its apointed Times on the first of July
            <lb/>she injoyed the Holy communion in the Sickroom with a melted &amp; Sinnerlike
            <lb/>dispossion she was a  little better she also participated with the
            <lb/>congregation on the 11<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> of the same month with a Thankful &amp; comforted Heart
            <lb/>&amp; Thus continued in a happy Expectation of her souls bridegroom
            <lb/>fetching Her to His arms &amp; bosom. the Consumation of
            <lb/>all her desires was blessedly compleatd Early on the morning
            <lb/>of the 3<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> of August &amp; in the 20 years of her age.</p></body></text></TEI>
