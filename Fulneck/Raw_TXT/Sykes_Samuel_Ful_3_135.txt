Br Saml Sykes.
The suddenness of the call from
time into eternity of one of the most
active members of the Congn who had
long resided in our midst, renders a
sketch of his character almost unnecessa
ry. And yet we love to think of the
dear departed and to trace some of
the non striking of its features. Then
was a frankness freedom from guilt
in his character; but the strongest trait
was active sympathy and kindness of
feeling towards all - ?? willing to aid
and assist even at the expense of his
own case and comfort. His energies, his
talents, and his time; As far as his own
duties allowed, were at the service of
Congon. He will be a missed man
in Fulnec. His charity made him
blind to the defects of others. and even
at times, led him to countenance ??


by his presence.
others what some would censure and
condemn.
He possessed a buoyancy of spirit, and
considering his age, a cheerful hilarity wch
has often astonished us. He delighted
to witness and assist in any gathering
of the young, to give espression utterance to feeling
of either national or social joy, And
his cheerful voice was heard encouraging
and prolonging expressions of delight re
joicing.
At the Christmas season especially
it was his yearly custom to collect a
number of his old friends to meet the
family circle. And also at this
season, he invariably devoted our ???
to gather together his aged friends
chiefly females, when with his own happy
countenance beaming with delight
he encouraged them to speak of the
goodness of God in the days past, and
closed the evening with prayer and


praise
Our late Br was born at
Linthwaite Hall near Huddersfield
Janry 11th 1796. His parents Both
his parents even members of the Mora
Brethren's Church, and his good and
pious Mother was very anxious, that
he should be trained up under the fos
tering care of that Church she so
much loved.
Many years previous to his
birth, the Brn had occupied used the old
Hall as an out preaching place at
tached to Wellhouse Congn, and every
month one or more of the Brn
visited and preached there to a small
flock, several of whom were in society
fellowship with the Church. These
periodical services were continued & were blessed to
which were blessed to many
many were continued during the
youthful years of our late Br and
and made a deep impression on


the young heart of our late now
happily departed Br.
The frequent visits of young
ministers and students of the Church
who never failed in their journeys to sp?
the Yorkshire & Lancashire Congns to call
at this hospitable abode, afforded oppor
tunities for him to hear of the love of
Christ and the Lords dealings with his
people.
Moreover he was blessed in having
a most affectionate & Christian Uncle
whose gentle spirit was ever ready to
counsel and advise him, and by his ??
and godlike walk and conversation was
a bright example. Of this, his old uncle
James, he often spoke with affectionate
regard. And truly he was a man
of God, an Isralite in whom was no
guilt, an humble follower of the
Lamb, simple and unaffected as a
Child. for he lived very near to the


Saviour. He walked with God, and
his eyes diffused with tears, while his
lips spoke of the love and mercy of his
Jesus.
Thus our late Brs early years were
spent in the bosom of an affectionate
family who were assiduously careful
of this their only child.
In 1808 his parents sent him
to the boarding school at Wellhouse, &
he often spoke of this period of his life
with unfeigned gratitude.
The year following he was bound
apprentice to Br Thos Sykes of Ashton.
Here his uprightness, diligence and
faithfulness, won for him the esteem
of his master, and the warm hearted
and Enduring love of his Christian
mistress. With these attended the
services at Dukenfield, and here also
he attained to further privileges in the
Congn. and was confirmed.
At the close of his apprentice


ship he returned home, and com
menced business for himself
But he longed for to nearer closer in
tercourse with the members of the
Congn., and as soon as a better he
determined as soon as a situation was
vacant, he would embrace the oppor
tunity. He had not long to wait
for in Febry 1818 he was called to fill
be assistant to Br Hanniman in the
shop at Fulnec. This he considered
a providential leading, and to his
dying day, he thanked his dear Saviour
that he had been led to this place to
dwell among his own people.
Oct 9th the was married to the Sl Sr
Lydia Verity, overseer of the needle work
in the Srs House. They before their
married life determined from the com
mencement of their married life that
all their doings should be influenced
by the love and fear of God. And in
accordance with the practise then


prevailing in the Congn he invited all
the married Brn & Srs to a cheerful love
feast. Throughout life, he continued
to value and enjoy all the peculiar
customs and usages of the church.
On Oct 1st 1830 he was called to
serve the church as Diacony master in
the shop and soon after was called elected to
fill the offices of Committee member &
first Chapel servant. In all these his
faithfulness & activity gained him the
love and esteem of his Brn & Srs.
Oct 6th 1842 our dear Br was
called upon to bear a heavy affliction in
the loss of his dearly beloved & faithful
wife. this was indeed a sore trial
but his confidence was in the Lord of
hosts, & it was not put to shame. He
was thus left a Widower with 7 dear
children, for whose welfare spiritual &
temporal he ?? showed the most
unwearied care and affectionate soli
tude. His children gave him great


pleasure, and up to the time of his
happy departure was favored to be
near him and enjoy his fatherly
care. If at any time he gave expression
to his ansious concern for them it
would be in these or similar words
"I wish my boys may keep in the way
and be screened from the evils of the
world. I should have more pleasure
in thinking of them if they joined the
Congn. This I trust will be the case
sometime." Doubtless his prayers and
tears have been treasured up in the book
of God's remembrance and will not be
forgotten. See paper
His Christian course was even for

though He said little of his experience
what he did say testified that he was
no stranger to the happiness which
a sense of peace and reconciliation
through the blood of Jesus produces.
With humility he would sometimes
deplore his coldness of heart and
that he suffered the cares of this


life to supress too much of his attenting 
His chief delights see believe was in the
Lord his God. The Writer of this
short account has had, especially
of late, many edifying conversations
with him satisfactory to the mind
that the one thing needful was
not forgotten. This was especially
the case during an alarming illness
in the beginning of this year. Death
was near, eternity at hand which
called forth deep searching of heart,
but his faith was fixed on the
Rock of Ages. "Nothing", he said
"nothing but my Saviour's blood and
death will do for me now." No hope
no plea but the attonement he made
for sinners I am I have been an
unworthy and sinful creature,
but he knows that I have loved
him." And can you trust him now?
asked his visitor. With a firm voice
he answered "yes," adding "I know
he will receive me." A few minutes
after the said, "I should like to recover

of my family; but if not, into
his hands I commit my spirit

morage from the nose, from which
he recovered he after occasionally
complained of langour and week
ness; but there were no symptoms
to cause alarm that (death) departure
was no near at hand. On Christmas
day, finding himself not well, at
the request of his children he called
on the doctor to consult with him,
and then was present at the latter
part of the morning service. Feeling
At dinner he assured his family that
he felt much relieved, and more
than once expressed this great
pleasure in seeing his children
around him. After diner he
lay on the sofa and conversed
freely with his eldest son. Contrary
to the entreaties of his children, he
determined to go to the Christmas
lovefeast at 5 o'clock and desired all
his children to go before him that
he might himself see all safe
and lock up the house. One
daughter however determined to
wait for her father as while he went
up stairs to secure the windows


and the doors of the rooms. More
than once she heard his voice
calling to her to hasten her
departure lest she should be
too late saying "I will soon follow"
Again she heard his voice from
the top of the stairs in a mourn
ful tone saying "I am very ill"
She assisted him down stairs
and onto a chair in the kitchen.
Fortunately at that moment his
son William and son-in-law Sewell
entered the house and assisted him
onto the sofa in the parlour where
he spoke but once repeating the
words "Oh my dear Saviour." He
lay conscious but unable to articulate
though he made many attempts,
and before the lovefeast was over
his ransomed spirit had joined
the congregation of the redeemed
before the throne.
"Happy soul thy days are ended,
All thy mourning days below
Thou by angel guards attended
Didst to Jesus presence go."
We mourn our loss, yet rejoice in
his eternal gain, and now we


do that for his honoured remains
which he often did for others.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust
to dust, in sure and certain hope
of a glorious resurrection, remem

meet again and so shall we be
ever with the Lord, where fore

words."
