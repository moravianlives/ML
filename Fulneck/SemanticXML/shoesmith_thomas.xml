							The Course of Life

							He was born Febr 20 1741 in Norwood Green
							in the Parish of Halifax Yorkshire; and
							baptizd in the Church of England His Parents
							being some of the first Yorkshire People that
							adher&apos;d to the Breth<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> perciev&apos;d in his Boys years
							that he was often much drawn by our dearest
							Saviour and he knew it timerself but continually resisted the Grace offerd unto him, and
							even hinder&apos;d his B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> by his bad Course.
							He did not like to go to the Meetings and would
							have even hinder&apos;d his Parents, for which Purpose once, <add place="above">when</add> he was about 14 Years of Age, he
							contriv&apos;d to behave very badly while they
							were gone to the Meetings at Fullneck that
							they might fear to go another Time, but that
							Night he could not sleep till after Midnight
							for the Disquietude of his Heart and was
							terribly frighted by a Vision or Spectre
							which, he always said, came to him while he
							was yet awake. This caused him to alter his
							Behaviour to an orderly but dejected Course.
							When he was about 17 he obtained Leave to live
							in the Course House where he continued 4

							or 5 Years, at first he was therein an hopefull
							Youth &amp; was soon reciev&apos;d into the Congregatn
							but after a while he became refractory and
							so very high minded that he lost his Senses
							and for some Time it become needfull to keep
							him in Chains, when he had recovered so far
							as to be able to work for his Living he went
							to dwell with his Parents, but he still would
							go his own bad Way in Disobedience to his
							Creator and his Parents, &amp; was so stubborn &amp;
							unruly as to shew a Disposition to beat his
							own Father. Thus it became unavoidable
							that he must leave his Fathers House and
							seek a Place for himself. He then boarded
							for some Time with a relation and went on
							in the Worlds bad Ways, but the Convictions of
							his Heart often made him uneasy. In about
							a Year he sought Acquaintance with his present Widow but her Relations opposing their
							Connexion he came awhile to his Father and
							then went to live in Leeds where he listed for a
							Soldier, but soon repented it and was got free by
							his Father, &amp; soon listed again &amp; repented again
							but was then oblig&apos;d to remain a Soldier about
							3 Months, tho&apos; very miserable &amp; much shock&apos;d at
							the bad actions of his Comerades, till the Soldiers
							finding him unfit for their Purpose, gave him
							his Distrarge in London. A Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> pitying him
							lent him Money to return <add place="above">to</add> his Father and he

							came to him sickly &amp; under Convictions. After
							living in a Brothers House in Pudsey for some
							Months he married his present Widow, by
							whom our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> has given him one Daugh<hi rend="superscript">tr</hi> who
							is still with its Mother in the Care of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
							On March 4 1768 He &amp; his Wife at their Request
							were acknowledged as Members of the Society
							His Hot &amp; impatient Temper sometimes still
							broke out in a very disagreable Manner when
							contradicted the otherwise he kept to his Work &amp;
							went on orderly. As to his Heart &amp; Conscience he
							constantly shewd &amp; express&apos;d himself self condemnd
							dejected &amp; reserved. When his impending Disso
							lution began to appear this Spring, by plain
							Tokens of a Consumption he could not bear to 
							hear any Thing of it. The many Mention stirring up an Enmity in him till about May 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							one Night he got a gracious Look from his
							mercifull Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> whereby he was quite alterd.
							believ&apos;d thenceforward that our Lord would take
							him in Mercy, became genuinely openhearted
							(which had been hitherto wanting) confess&apos;d
							that Pride &amp; fleshly Lusts had been the Cause
							of all his Deviations, &amp; said: the Enmity of ones
							own Heart is much worse to bear than <add place="above">all</add> bodily
							Pain. According to his earnest &amp; written
							Request he was publickly absolved on June 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							and the whole congregation sung their hearty Wish
							es for him. As his Body grew weaker he became
							more &amp; more desirous of going to Him who

							died for him, whom he could now look on as his
							best Friend. Oh! said he I have been a great Re 
							bel against our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> but now He will have
							Mercy on me and I want to go to him this very
							1/4 of hour if it might be while you are here, he
							mention&apos;d in a contrite Manner his own bad behaviour at the Time of his Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephens last
							Sickness, and also to his own Wife at different
							Times. On July 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> His Head continually catchd
							as convuls&apos;d in he often gaspd for Breath, and
							looked ghastly as a dying Man: yet often repeated
							very Sweetly: Dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> come &amp; fetch me! 
							Dearest Lamb! my Saviour! my dear Lamb!
							B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greening said: dost Thou then love that Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>?
							he replied very earnestly: yes I do love Him, I did
							long to live for him as a Boy: but afterwards I
							was unfaithfull but now He has forgiven me 
							&amp; will be very pretty to live with him for ever,
							ah! if I was but with Him! after this by a
							Discharge of much Matter from his Lungs he
							was relieved for some Days, once when he had
							spoken agood deal of his being a Rebel, &amp; of our
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mercy he said: I was once out of my Senses
							Oh! I shall have much to thank him for when
							I come home! This his ardent Longing to go to
							his Souls Redeemer was granted him on July
							the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> after receiving the Blessing of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
							in the 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year of his Age.
