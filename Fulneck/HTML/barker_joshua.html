      <h2>Joshua Barker</h2>
      <h2>1</h2>
      <p> Departed <em>March 24th 1761</em> Our Brother<a href="#mlper000555.html">Joshua Barker</a>was born in the <em>Year 1696, <br></br> on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of December</em> at
         								<a href="#mlpla000339.html">Hopton in the Parish of Mirfield</a> he lived with his <br></br> Father till <em>19 Years of
            							Age</em> at which time he was put Apprentice to a Broad-Cloth- <br></br> ier in
         						that neighborhood, he was married to his present Widow the <em>15<sup>th</sup> of
            							July <br></br> 1719</em> by whom he has had 8 Childrn two of whom went home in their Infancy <br></br> and one at Mans Estate and of the 5 survising ones, one Son is a member
         						of <br></br> our Society, he liv'd happily with his Wife and being of a religious turn he went <br></br> with his Wife constantly to the
         							<a href=".html">Church</a> &amp; Sacrament, and had religious Meet- <br></br> ings kept in his house where they us'd to pray and read
         							Burkets Exposition on <br></br> the new Testament; his self working was for some time in his way, so that to <br></br> be a poor
         						Sinner at the feet of <a href=".html">Jesus</a> was a hard matter to him for some time, <br></br> and he was a long time among the B<sup>rn</sup> before he got a feeling of our Sav<sup>rs</sup> Dying <br></br>Lovein his heart. When <a href="#mlper000536.html">Mr Ingham</a> preach'd in the Beginning in these parts <br></br> he went to hear him,
         						his Wife at first was against it; but upon her hearing <br></br> both <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Ockertshausen</a> at her own house her
         						Prejudice dropt away and they <sup>both</sup> went <br></br> both together, he always had a great attachment to the
         								B<sup>rn</sup>, and upon <del>the</del> his <br></br> Land Lords being against the Preaching at his house, he rather left it than com-
         						<br></br> ply with his Desire not to let the Gospel be preach'd there. He soon became <br></br> a Member of our
         							Society, and had the Grace to be receiv'd on the <em>22<sup>d</sup> of April <br></br> 1752</em> into the Cong<sup>n</sup> &amp;
         							<em>Nov. 19<sup>th</sup> in the same year</em> he partook of the highest Good in <br></br> the holy Sacrament for the first time. Within these 2 Years he has occasionally <br></br> said to his Wife I shall not be long here but shall soon be
         						go home, but don't be trou- <br></br> bled for you will not stay long after me. At the regulating of the Bands and Classes <br></br> anew in <em>January 1760</em> he became a Band Servant, in which capacity he was a <br></br> faithfull Helper &amp; belov'd by his B<sup>rn</sup>, and found a Blessingfor his own heart. <br></br> On <em>Monday night the 10<sup>th</sup> of November</em> he was
         						taken with a violent and pain- <br></br> full Disorder so that his Disolution was expected before morning, the Vio-
         						<br></br> lence of which was however somewhat abated the next Day when he was visited <br></br> by <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup>
            							Watson</a> on his return from <a href="#mlpla000043.html">Huddersfield</a>. He was very chearfull not- <br></br>
         						withstanding his great bodily Pain &amp; in a sinnerlike Connexion with the man <br></br> of Sorrows, whom he said he
         							longed to see face to face, &amp; beg'd him and the <br></br>B<sup>r</sup>n to bear him on their hearts, before Him on that account.
         						From his first <br></br> becoming sick he always thought he <br></br> should yet Permission to leave his mor- <br></br> tal Tent, and from hence be taken the faithfull one to see, at
         						which he <br></br> frequently rejoic'din his heart, &amp; speaking with a Brother of the great Long- <br></br> ing he felt to be at home with
         						his wounded Friend that only matchless Heart</p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> Heart and observing his Wife looked thoughtfull, he said to her when I am <br></br> with him I will speak a good Word for you, that he may soon
         						fetch you also <br></br> and I'm sure he will not deny me my Request and this he comforted her about <br></br> their parting. Soon after the Sacrament, being visited by a B<sup>r</sup>Â he express'd <br></br> his great Longing for that highest Good, in order to strengthen his heart under <br></br> the great bodily pain he felt and declared
         						that the better Death and Passion of <br></br> the Lord<a href=".html">Jesus</a> was what his heart rely'd upon and his its only Good for time &amp; <br></br> Eternity. Once being visited he
         						express'd his Desire to be buried with his B<sup>rn</sup><br></br> at <a href=".html">Lambs Hill</a> and seemed grieved that on account of his outward Circumstances <br></br> he must give up that hope but he was soon comforted upon our assuring <br></br> him we wou'd see to it that his desire shou'd be accomplish'd. <em>Jan 21<sup>st</sup></em> he had <br></br> his part of the holy Sacrament with some other sick for which End he came on Horse- <br></br> back <del>to the</del> to the <a href=".html">Chapel</a> which
         						was the last time of his being there. On the <br></br>Great Sabbath<a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Watson</a> carried him the Sacram<sup>t</sup>, and first related <sup>to him</sup> what <br></br><del>had</del> had pass'd in the Cong<sup>n</sup> at <a href=".html">G.H</a>. on Maunday Thursday and then <sup>in a</sup> child- <br></br> like <del>Prayer</del> Prayer beg'd that mouth which spoke his own clean, to speak this <br></br>B<sup>r</sup> who could not enjoy the Application of the bloody Gore from his Back in y<sup>e</sup><br></br>Pedilavium on account of Sickness clean, and to hasten the ripening of this fruit
         <br></br> of his Deaths Agony &amp; take him home to himself
         						or soon enable him to appear <br></br> again among his B<sup>rn</sup>. Then he sung: What Lord thee so
         							tormented &amp;c. O let him in <br></br> thy nail holes see his Pardon &amp; Election free &amp;c. Give him absolution, and a gen-
         <br></br> tle
         							praising Tone, deep Foundation in thy Cross's Stem, and then during an <br></br>inexpressible tender &amp; melting feeling he receiv'd his share of the holy Sacram<sup>t</sup><br></br> after which he was particularly chearfull and happy and frequently said to his <br></br> Wife, now I have got
         						what I wanted, and seem'd highly blessed. That Night <br></br> was a very painfull night to him and his
         							Disorder very became again very vio- <br></br> lent. On Monday being visited by one of the B<sup>rn</sup> to
         						whom he again signified his <br></br>Longing to be at home which Desire was granted him the next day in the Eve- <br></br> ning about 8o'clock after having
         						lain quiet &amp; still from about 4o'clock with- <br></br> out speaking, he sweetly fell asleep &amp; grew pale on
         							<a href=".html">Jesus</a> arm &amp; Bosom, in y<sup>e</sup><br></br> 65<sup>th</sup> year of his dying Life, with that Childrens Watch Word; all that <br></br> are in the Graves shall hear his
         							voice. Now there's no Soul who doth <br></br> not want (ev'n when in her LordsJoy) and doth not quick upon the Grant <br></br> fetch her Corpses revrently. </p>PAGE BREAK</body>
