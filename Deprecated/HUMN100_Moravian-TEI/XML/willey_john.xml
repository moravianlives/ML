                  Memoir
                  Of Br John Willey, a Servant of the Lord
                  in the Brn's Church, who departed this
                  life in Gracehill, October 6th 1847.
                  Aged 66 years.
                  Written by his children
                  
                  Not having been able to find any
                  account of our dear father's life, written
                  by himself, we can merely record some of
                  the principal outward outward changes which he 
                  met with here, adding, the few remarks on 
                  himself and his experience, which have 
                  recurred to us in the private diaries of his
                  congregation and in his cor(r)espondence.
                  He was born Dec. 13th 1781 in Ful-
                  nec; his father, Michael Willey (born 1729
                  died aged 86, having served the the Congregation
                  66 years" was at that time laborer of the
                  Congregation at Pudsey.  He had one sister be-
                  ing and one brother, Joseph, both older
                  ​​​​​​​than

                  than himself; of whom his brother
                  was many years an active mins-
                  ter of several congregations, and
                  was called home before him to his 
                  eternal rest, Aug. 11th 1841.  A strong
                  affection existed between the bro-
                  thers, and some of our dear father's
                  happiest seasons were the visits
                  which he was occasionally though
                  rarely able to pay to his brother and
                  family.  His early life, though chequer-
                  ed by the death of an affectionate
                  mother, when he was only 6 years
                  of age, appears to have passed very 
                  pleasantly among the youth in Ful-
                  nec.  His old teacher B.  Bradley, kept
                  an unfailing place in his memory, 
                  and he spoke much and with great
                  kindness of his well-remembered
                  care and love.  As a sign of the com-
                  parative innocences of those early 
                  years, he would mention the fact 
                  that he had never heard an oath
                  ​​​​​​​until he had attained the age of 12 years

                  years. From some narratives of
                  that time which he would occasion-
                  ally call to mind, it seems as tho'
                  his habitual good temper had early
                  displayed itself, and rendered him 
                  a favorite amongst his teachers and
                  companions.  At the age of 14, he went,
                  as was there customary, to learn a 
                  trade in Bedford, where he experi-
                  enced great kindness from Br. Livius,
                  of whom he long retained a grateful
                  recollection.  Here of course, he was
                  somewhat more of the world and of
                  its ways of sinful pleasure, and ap-
                  pears to have lamented the want of
                  Godliness amongst many of the young
                  people with whom he was associated.
                  It was particularly whilst on a visit
                  in London, on his way to Kingswood
                  that he was struck with the deep de-
                  pravity of human nature, and
                  found gratitude to that Lord, to whom
                  he had been early led, and who had
                  so mercifully held his preserving hand

                  hand over him. At the same time,
                  we doubt not, he obtained deeper
                  views of his own sinfulness, and
                  of his need of the salvation wrought
                  for sinners, though the meritorious
                  life and death of our Lord and Sa-
                  vior Jesus Christ.
                  In 1802, when 21 years of age,
                  he went to Bristol; and on his fa-
                  ther's being appointed laborer of
                  Kingwood congregation about that time,
                  he was frequently with him there
                  assisting in the school in that place.
                  It was here he was viewed with the
                  Congregation, and shortly after, in 1804,
                  very permitted to partake for the
                  first time of the Holy Communion
                  There events seem to have made a
                  way deep impression upon his
                  mind, if we may judge from a
                  remarkable experience which
                  he has recorded as having happened
                  in him on the morning of Palm sunday
                  1804.  If it came upon me sleeping, he

                  he writes, it made the same impression
                  as though I had been awake.  There
                  came over me a great fear and trem-
                  bling violent sweat, and a dread of
                  being destroyed instantly.  I lifted up
                  my hand and raised my eyes, but
                  could not rise, for the clothes were as
                  a rock around me.  There stood one
                  whose eyes were fixed on me, with a
                  shining light; before him an upright
                  pillar, with which I expected to be slain,
                  for the sense of my guilt increased my
                  fear.  I never can forget his look.  He
                  spoke - O how long have I delayed my
                  coming; how long have I observed thy
                  ways; I have had patience with thee;
                  thou hast had advantages but thou hast
                  neglected them; thy crimes are very great,
                  thou hast been preserved through mer-
                  cy hither to, but now ______ Here I pray-
                  ed earnestly for mercy, that I might not 
                  Be destroyed in my sins; yet my heart
                  was hard as the rock.  I was powerfully
                  convinced that it was Jesus who
                  ​​​​​​​stood before me, and continued praying till

                  Till at last he mercifully Caused floods
                  of tears to flow from mine eyes.  Where
                  I still in treated him to have mercy 
                  on me a wretched and guilty sinner,
                  his countenance changed, he seemed
                  filled with compassion, looked on me
                  with pity, and spoke to me kindly, so
                  that I was convinced I was heard.
                  His last words were very impressive.
                  "Be in earnest for your soul's salvation
                  lest I come quickly with a woe."  Where
                  he vanished, the pillar that that seemed rea-
                  dy to destroy me, appeared changed into
                  a hom(e) of salvation.  I awoke to my
                  utter astonishment, and continued 
                  long in prayer for the assistance I have
                  daily and hourly need from a cruci-
                  fied Savior.
                  Our dear father appears about this time
                  to have been tried with a delicate
                  state of health, sometimes suffering
                  from new and affections, which had
                  their bad effects upon his spirits.
                  In May 1806 he went to Fulnec, and
                  after midsummer the same year, he

                  he entered as a teacher with Misfield
                  school.  The next year he went to Fulnec,
                  to take charge of the Day school there,
                  but was soon again (Sept 1808) recalled
                  to Mirfield.  The 5 years spent in the
                  school there, he remembered with
                  much pleasure; he remembered great
                  affection for his pupils, and not a few
                  of his old schools have shown that they
                  recall his memory with pleasure.  He
                  spoke after of his agreeable and brotherly
                  intercourse with Br. Pohlman, there
                  Minister and Director of the school
                  at Misfield.  His spare time was spent
                  in visiting the sick in the neighbor-
                  hood, and in cultivating that science
                  which always retained such attractions
                  for him, and in which he certainly dis-
                  played mean talent.  The corespond-
                  ence afterwards maintained with his
                  relative, Sir W. Hamilton on astronomical
                  subjects, was a source of great delight
                  to him; and the laborious and neatly
                  expected tables and calculations
                  which he has left behind him, show his

                  His ingenuity and talent. It was in
                  Mirfield in March 1809, that he first
                  publicly proclaimed the Gospel,to be-
                  come a faithful minister of which, we
                  sincerely believe, was his highest aim.
                  In Sept. 1812 he was called to be Sgle.
                  Brn’s Laborer in Fulnec ;a part which
                  he found more difficult than the one
                  he had occupied in Mirfield. He lament
                  ed the wait(weight) of the spiritual life in ma-
                  ny members of the choir for the good
                  of which he was appointed to labor; and
                  cases might occur here, as elsewhere,
                  where his meek and yielding temper
                  would make the exercise of proper disci-
                  pline, and faithfulness in reproving, a
                  difficult task for him.
                  In June 1814 he was called to Dublin,
                  As Sgle Brn’s Laborer, and remained in that  
                  past for 3 years, during which time we
                  know of little worth recording concerning
                  him. In 1817 he was ordained in Grace-
                  Hill by Br. Benade, and called to serve
                  the Congn. at Ballinderry. August 21 he
                  was married to the Sgle .Sr.Susan Hutton,

                  that teacher in the ladies school at 
                  Gracehill. In Ballinderry they spent
                  10 useful and happy years; but also
                  their four oldest surviving children
                  were born; one little daughter being
                  taken from them by the Lord in early 
                  infancy.   In 1826 they removed to
                  Cootehill, a congregation which had been
                  for some years without a Laborer, and 
                  was in a very low condition, seeming
                  to require all the energy which health
                  and activity could supply. Here, as long
                  as his health permitted him, our dear
                  father labored cheerfully and in blessing.
                  An account which he draw up for him-
                  self of the various preaching places
                  he attended in the neighborhood, and
                  the success he met with in proclaim-
                  ing the joyful news of saluation, tes-
                  tifies to his activity. In the year 1833,
                  1 year after his arrival in Cootehill,
                  he visited 12 out-preaching places,
                  mostly once a fortnight, at an average
                  distance of 4 or 5 miles, and some
                  12 and even 17 miles from Cootehill.

                  The following memorandum at the
                  close of 1832,will share the spirit in
                  which he labored:”When at the close
                  of this year, I take a view of my poor,
                  imperfect services in the vineyard of 
                  our Lord, I see much cause for the 
                  deepest humiliation, on account of my
                  innurmerable transgressions,failings,
                  and short-comings, and fervently pray
                  my merciful Saviour and gracious
                  Lord and Master, to forgive me in all
                  things  where in I have been to blame;
                  whether it be in the omission of my
                  duty, or in the performance of it in a
                  wrong spirit, by hearkening at times
                  to the secret whisper of approbation in 
                  my unhallowed breast, and forgetting
                  to give all the honor and glory to the Lord.
                  It is by his gracious assistance, I 
                  have been enabled to testify to my 
                  fellow-sinners, the richness of his
                  Grace; whereas, if he had left me
                  to myself, I should have sunk into

                  and pride might be so mortified in
                  me, that I might even remember, that
                  I am naught but a poor, worthless,
                  unprofitable servant, and Christ
                  my All!
                  Lord keep me contrite, low and poor,
                  Thus shall I praise thee memorie(his memory);
                  Myself thrice blessed I can call,
                  When I am nought, and thou my all!”
                  In Cootehill,our dear Father’s
                  health quickly declined, and symp-
                  tons of those complicated diseases
                  began to show themselves, which
                  gradually affected almost every vi-
                  tal part, and mostly disabled him
                  from duty during the last six years
                  of his life. Soon after his first serious
                  attack, we find his experience recorded
                  thus:”In the beginning of May 1841,
                  I had a violent attack of influenza
                  which lasted a long while, and caused
                  me to notice to rest early in the after-
                  noon. In the month of July I left
                  Cootehill for Ballinderry in hopes
                  that the change of air might be of

                  service to me ; but this not being the
                  case, I begged my dismissal from ac-
                  tive Service in Cootehill, for I saw my- 
                  self necessitated to notice from the work
                  and labor of love in which my soul
                  delighted, by the severe Affliction by
                  with which a merciful and long-suf-
                  ferring Saviour visited me. I humbly,
                  bow down with submission to his bles-
                  sed will, and can say in this trial.
                  As I was enabled to do when lately
                  receiving the account of my dear Bro-
                  ther's departure: “It is the lord, let him
                  Do what seemeth him good.” I feel too
                  weak to participate deeply of the cup
                  of affiliation, and my dear Saviour
                  favors me, by permitting me to leave
                  all my griefs with him, and he con-
                  fonts me in such a manner that I can
                  not say I have had an hours real dis-
                  tress. After nearly 15 years labor amongst
                  the little flock at Cootehill,  having long
                  shared both joy and grief with them,
                  It is no wonder that I feel much at
                  the thoughts of being obliged to resign

                  my change of them. My prayers at least
                  on their behalf, shall be continued at
                  the throne of grace. In looking at the fu-
                  ture, it is still my desire, that if our
                  Dear Lord and Master should be pleased
                  to bless the means used for my recovery,
                  I may yet be employed in some part or
                  other of his vineyard, to bear still further
                  testimony of his great love to sinners. O
                  might I be more devoted to Him and
                  serve Him more faithfully till the end
                  of my days.”
                  In the course of some months, our father
                  thought himself sufficiently recovered
                  to asume his labors in Cootehill, and
                  accordingly removed thither from Bal-
                  linderry in March 1843. The Brn. &amp; Srs.
                  rejoiced exceedingly on his return, wel-
                  coming him with the sincerest to-
                  kens of affection; and the ensuing pas-
                  sion season proved a time of great en-
                  joyment to this little flock and to their
                  pastor. But in the autumn of the same
                  year he felt his strength again failing,
                  and in the winter he was frequently

                  unable to preach.
                  In the summer of 1844, he felt in(it) ne-
                  cessary again to leave Cootehill, to which
                  he never returned, but took up his resi-
                  dence with his children at Glenary,
                  till the following year 1845. In April
                  he returned to Gracehill, with the expecta-
                  tion of ending his days in the midst
                  of that Congregation.  In the summer of
                  1846, according to the Doctor’s advice, he
                  sought change of air, and spent upwards
                  of 4 months and lodgings near Bally-
                  Castle, close to the sea-shore, which he
                  believed through the Lord’s blessing,
                  helped to prolong his life.
                  In the beginning of October he re-
                  turned to Gracehill, and in the follow-
                  ing winter endured much pain and
                  severe suffering, with patience and
                  resignation. To his Saviour’s will,
                  which his faith and love taught
                  him to regard as always conducive
                  to his own real good. The vacations

                  around him were during these three
                  years of trial, seasons of great plea-
                  sure to him, and we have at such
                  times been frequently struck with his
                  cheerfulness and time enjoyment of
                  life amidst all its drawbacks, and
                  edified with the example of resigna-
                  tion and Christian patience which he
                  presented to us. He did not converse
                  much on subjects of spiritual experi-
                  ence, but his own interest in the
                  truths of revelation, and particularly
                  his love for and delight in our hymns
                  was always apparent.
                  When the spring of 1847 returned with-
                  out any lasting improvement in his
                  state, he could express himself as per-
                  fectly resigned to the Lord’s will with
                  him, though he naturally longed for
                  ease and outward comfort, and faith-
                  fully used every means recommend-
                  ed. His faith meanwhile seemed
                  purified in the fire of these afflic-
                  tions, and his love and gratitude

                  than Perhaps at every former period of
                  his life.
                  we find the following reflections written
                  in the summer of this year:
                  It had been my lot to be afflicted for
                  the last five years of my life, but I had
                  abundant cause to bless the Lord for
                  his meeting me in the way he has done,
                  since nothing else would have brot
                  me so closely to his feet.  I have learnt
                  more of the love of Jesus in the school
                  of affliction, than I ever knew before,
                  and I can rejoice in Christ Jesus as
                  my faithful helper in time of need,
                  my good physician and nurse, and
                  my merciful savior who for forgiveth
                  all my iniquities. I have no confi-
                  dence in any other; in him alone I
                  place my trust, and find him al-
                  ways willing to help me. I delight
                  to look to him by faith, and to think
                  that though he is in the brightness
                  of his glory, he permits me a poor
                  sinful creature to behold him in
                  His

                  his suffering, in his deep humiliation
                  in the garden, died on the cross. He
                  knows that nothing else can comfort
                  me in the midst of my pain, and
                  thus he structures my cup and makes
                  me resigned and cheerful. I have
                  passed through years of trial and
                  suffering, I have come through great
                  tribulation, yet I do not wish it
                  had been less; I am sure my Savior
                  has proportioned this chastisement
                  to the necessities I neglected to bring
                  me wholly to himself, that I might
                  see the exceeding sinfulness of sin,
                  be completely weaned from this present
                  evil world, and live solely to his praise
                  and glory. Blessed be his name, he
                  has in a great measure affected his
                  gracious purpose, and my joy no man 
                  can take from me." In another place 
                  he says: "The blessings I have enjoyed,
                  especially during the latter part of my
                  sufferings, have been so rich and great,
                  that I have most sincerely thanked our
                  precious Savior Jesus, for visiting
                  Me

               <p>            
                  me with this very affliction, since it
                  has opened to me more clearly the 
                  pathway to glory." After making
                  an affecting comparison between his
                  own distress, and the far greater
                  and meritorious sufferings of his
                  Saviour, he adds: "I know he loves
                  me and I love him sincerely, but 
                  not as I ought. I can never love
                  him here as I ought for what he has
                  done for me." The change of residence
                  to the shore of the lake which was
                  made at his request in May, seemed
                  at first to revive him, but it became
                  gradually more and more evident,
                  that it was not the Lord's will to 
                  lengthen his life here, but to take him
                  soon from tribulation here below, to 
                  the pleasures for even more at his right 
                  hand. About the middle of Sept. he
                  returned to his resting place in Grace-
                  hill, there in patience to await the
                  Lord's good time to call him 
                  In the visits which the laborers
                  of the Congregation paid him in these last weeks,

                  he appeared to continue in the sacred
                  resigned and happy frame.  His humil-
                  iation deepened till the last, his views
                  of faith were cleaner, his love grew
                  stronger. He mentioned the ways which
                  he used to sing _ And there may I as
                  vile as he, Wash all my sins away,
                  but which he now called joyfully re-
                  peat _ And there have I as vile as he,
                  washed all my sins away. He said
                  he believed if he had seen this Gospel
                  doctrine so clearly at the time of his early
                  ministry as he did now, his preaching
                  would, with the Lord's blessing, have
                  been more effectual. His extreme weak-
                  ness had after led himself and others
                  to think the time of his departure mean
                  at hand, and as often he had again, re-
                  gained his strength, battling the skill 
                  of the physicians.
                  On the night of Oct. 5 he was home 
                  to rest as usual, and though exceed-
                  ingly weak, he was in a peaceful,
                  happy state of mind, full of heavenly
                  contemplation, his thought evidently
                  resting.

                  resting on some object which filled 
                  him with a calm and holy joy. Whilst
                  being settled for the night, he repeatedly
                  said: "How much! how much to sleep
                  in Jesus!" One of his children asking
                  him, whether he meant the sheep of the
                  body, he only answered with a placid
                  smile. He'd had, no doubt, a presentiment
                  that he was about to fall in to that sleep
                  in Jesus, which with his believing peo-
                  ple only the spiritual awakening to
                  endless happiness in his presence _
                  His last words were: "How much
                  to be a sheep of Jesus." After this, he
                  slumbered quietly til towards morn-
                  ing, where a change apparently coming
                  over him, his wife and the three of his
                  children there with him, assembled
                  around his bed to witness his gentle
                  and happy departure from this world
                  of suffering, to that happier one of end-
                  less felicity and glory. They sung a 
                  verse with breaking voices, of which
                  he appeared just conscious and
                  soon after he gently slept away, re-
                  signing

                  signing his spirit without a struggle
                  with the faithful hands of Jesus, of that
                  Lord whom he believed in and loved,
                  and in whose presence, we doubt not,
                  he now enjoys the happiness and rest re-
                  served for those whose sins are washed
                  away in his blood, and whose spirits

                  one beloved by all who knew him, and
                  doubly endeared to us, we sorrow not
                  as those that have no hope; may rather,
                  so confident are we of his present hap-
                  pier state, so glad to think of his release
                  from so much suffering, that we rejoice,
                  and join him in praising the Lord for 
                  his past mercies to his servant, and for
                  the communication of that happiness
                  which he is now enjoying.
