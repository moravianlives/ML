               <p>Our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> showed me his <name type="emotion">loving</name> and forgiving heart, and I felt that he had suffered, bled and died for me. Being
                  of an unsteady turn of mind I soon came into things again which was contrary to our <roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> will, an which account I spent many heavy hours but
