The of Life of the gr. girl Faith Naylor. She has left the following
acount of her Self
I was borne at Holme 1744. Decber ye 1t 1744.
my Parents being in Conextion with ye Brn
ever since I was about two years Old, they took
me to ye Meetings with them, for which I soon got a
likeing. when Bror Helt came to York-shier
ye Children were taken Under His care. I took great
delight in going to ye Meetings which He keept; ye
tender & lively Manner in which He Used to
disscribe ye Wounds of our Saviour was ye meens of
bringing me to have a desire in my heart to know
some thing of that Suffering Savr., in 49 there was
a School began at Holme, & I was one that went to
it; & took much delight therein because I lov'd ye Sisrs very
much. (when Br Helt went away, Br. Gross came
whom I also lov'd very much, but after His being
Cal'd home to our Savr, there was no Childrens
parents which Griev'd me very much, where upon
I thought I wou'd apply to ye Sisrs, to be taken
under their care. I spoke to Sisr Sophia, who was
at that at that time ye great Girls Labouress. 
She Ask'd me what was my Reson for wanting to
come among of great Girls? I told her that I wanted
it for no other Reason but that I might enjoy something
for my heart, & ye Children had none no body to care
for them, this my desire was soon granted me, ye Classes
& other Opertunities of ye Girls, prov'd a great blessing
for my heart), I (Soon) got a Strong desire to live in
ye Choir House, Spoke with my parents about it
& Obtaind their leave, I then made my desire know'n
to my Labouress, (here being at that time no Great Girls
in ye Choir house, it I was, Ask'd how I Came upon
Such thoughts, for I was to young, but however I Contin
ued to intret for it) & in a Short time, I obtaing this great
grace, to my great joy, with four other Girls,


I was but wild & Awkward, therefore every thing
Seem'd very Strange to me, & I found had a great
deal to learn. Yea some times thought I shou'd never
Come thro' this. I unadvicdly happen'd to tell my
Mother, who afterwards attempted to take me home;
which brought me into some distress I haveing no
inclenation for going back to my parents when I Con
siderd ye Matter rightly in my heart; I begd ye
Sisrs to Stand my frinds & interceed for me, for it
was my ditermination never to leve ye Choir-house
it however went but heavely with me for some time
& I caused my self at well as my Sisrs a great deal of trouble
this gave me much Consern of mind, & brought me
to be a Sinner before our Savr for my Unbroken
ness of heart, one day when I was very much
Opress'd about about my self & feeling that I did not
yet know our Saviour as wounded for my Sins
I went by my Self, laid my Self with all my Misery
befour our Saviour, beg'd Him to give me a drop of
his Blood in my heart & let me fell his pardoning
love in my heart, & ye forgiveness of my Sins, in
his blood, I shall never forget this blessd moment
in all my life, for it was to me as if I Saw my
gracious Redemer Standing before me & laying
His thro' pierced hands upon me, this Caus'd a
divine peace thro' heart & mind and provd an
abiding grace
Novber ye 13th 1759. I was Recd into ye Congre
gation where upon I gave my Self anew to our Savr
which prov'd a real blessing to me, but some time
after this I began to fell be dissatisfied about my
self, being Sensable, that I was not yet in that
Conextion with our Savr as I Shoud & Ought to
be, I often Spoke with our Savr about it &


beg'd him with tears to help me, & make me he
such a happy heart, as night Yeild joy to him & 
to my Sisrs. He granted my request, & I grew very 
happy, & Chearfull (when I was mov'd out of a lesser
Girls room into ye biger, it Cost me Some pain, but
in a short time I grew Satisfed, and my only pain of
heart now was that I did not become more a joy to
my Lambs heart, who had undergone so much for me
June ye 24th 60. at ye New regulation, of bands, &
Clases of or great Girls, I got at ye Same time, a New
blessing for my heart)
Janry ye 3d 61 I got a Voilent sickness, which Seemd
as if it wou'd be ye means of bringing me soon to
my Everlasting home, of which I should have been
very glad, if it had ben our Savrs will, tho' it never
was quit Clear to me that I Shoud go at this time
but however this Sickness prov'd a great blessing to me
my heart became more tender towards my dearest
Savr then ever, He often let me fell his sweet Nearness
and I kept many a hearty band with him, & begd
Him very often, that if he did not see fit to take me
at this time home he himself, yet that he however
Shou'd not tarry long, but if possable to hasten my
preparation, & fetch me soon to himself, so fare
her own words; after this she went for a few weeks
to her room Companions again, but on April
ye 10th She Came again into ye Sick-room where upon
She Said to her Sick waiter, now I Shall go no more
out of ye Sick-room till I go home, it was really
a pleasare to all around her, who beheld her serene
and Chearfull State of heart & mind, amidst ye
 great pain She under went; if when any one piked her
She woud answer dont mind me, it will soon be over
When Sisr Mary who was going on a Visit to london


took Leve of her, She thank'd her for all ye Care
& trouble which She had Spent on her;
about a fourt night before her departure a visible
alteration was to be seen in her; so that all most
ever day Seemd as if it wou'd be ye last, tho' at times
She was very brisk, & Chearfull, so that it was a
pleasure to be with her, one day as She awoke
out of a Soft Sleep, & look'd peculerly pleasent.
She was Ask'd what She look'd so for? She Answerd
O I have seen such a Number of Angles, & you Cant
Emagen imagine how prity they Look'd, I desired them to
take me with them to our Saviour, but they Said
they must not take me yet, but they wou'd, Come
in a very Short time a gain, and then they wou'd
take me with them. She retaind her Sences to ye
last, & was often heard speaking with our Saviour
saying, O Come quickly my dearest Lamb ye
time Seems long, when will thou fetch me She begd
Continually for ye Sisrs to Sing for her; and just
before her Departure, with a Clear Voice gave
out that Vers the Lamb with all his Greif & Smart
& then was sung farther Open Arms take her,
Pail Lips &c Grant her to leav unshaken, and
dureing those words, from hence She now is taken
