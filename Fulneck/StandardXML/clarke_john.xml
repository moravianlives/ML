            <lb/>cation was for a little time prevented from going to hear, because as he said ye
            <lb/>Comon prayer was read, &amp; he lik'd best to hear Ministers who Pray'd by
            <lb/>Heart &amp; not by Book, when B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Browne came to assist M<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ing
