					<p> Our <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<persName ref="#mlper000429"><hi rend="superscript">Robert Lilley</hi></persName> was born in the <date type="birth" when-iso="1697-10">Month of Oct<hi rend="superscript"

						Hardship. Having learned the <name occupation="clothier">Clothiers Bussiness</name> and being now <date when-iso="1723" cert="medium">26 years of age</date>, <name

						2 Daughters. One of the latter went happily to our dear <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> before him, out at the <placeName>S. S<hi

						Children, Husband of his Wife, and Father of a Family, was equally concerned for the Salvation of his whole House, and was not satisfied untill they all heard with him the

						<roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> Grace, he once during a <name event="religious">Preaching</name> of <persName ref="#mlper000536">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Inghams</persName> became particularly happy, thro&apos; the <roleName type="honorific">holy Ghosts</roleName> applying the Word to his heart. When <persName>M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Spangenberg</persName> went about settling Societies in these Districts he became a Member of the same. He having a great Love for the
							<orgName>Church</orgName> he was brought up in and being now more clear in what one went properly to divine Service for, he continued going to Church for a long while
						believing that our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> blessed him there like wise. But as his Heart could be no more satisfied without
						Fellowship, and he not meeting with it there, this determined him to follow solely and alone the Track our dear <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName> Might lead him among the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>, in which Resolution he was very steady, untill he was <name
							event="reception">recieved</name> into the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, which came to pass <date when-iso="1748-08-13">Augst
								13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1748</date> on account of which Grace he was very much melted and thankful. <date when-iso="1748-11-13">In the same Year, namely the
								13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Novr</date> he went with the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> to the <name event="communion"
							>holy Comunion</name> for the first time, and as he has never enjoy&apos;d it before in his Life time out of a profound Respect he had for the same, His Heart was so much
						the more bowed on account of this great Grace and concerning which he said: No Tongue is able to express the feeling of my Heart, that such a poor Worm as me, is permitted to
						enjoy this highest Treasure. This Awefull Impression of the <name event="sacrament">holy Sacrament</name> abade with him to the End of his Life. An accidental Circumstance
						proved the Occasion to determine him and his Wife to spend the Remainder of their Days in <placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulneck</placeName> and having obtained Leave to move
						thither, He was soon <note type="catchword">there</note>

							1759</date>. His Grace Election was very important to him and which he kept continually in his Eye, and when he had the Favour to become <name office="disciple">Cong<hi
								rend="superscript">n</hi> Disceple</name>, which Dignity he was twice invested with, his heart was so humbled and broken because of the Sense of his unworthiness that
						he went to his <name relation="son">Son</name>
						<persName>James</persName>, entreated him to assist him in praying our dear <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> that His Intention with him
						might be obtained. In his Course and Walk, this in a Measure unobserved, he enjoy&apos;d much of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName>
						Love and Grace, and so as he grew weaker and feebler in his Body his Tenderness towards his <roleName type="honorific">Redeemer</roleName> encreased, and his Longing to be soon
						with him grew more ardant. He was often seen weeping when by himself, and if asked what was the Cause of at, he said: <name type="emotion">These are not Tears of Sorrow, but
							Tears of Love to my <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName></name>. When he was the last time at the <name event="communion">holy Comunion</name> in the
							<placeName>Hall</placeName>, he had an Intimation of it that this would be the last time he should enjoy that greatest of Blessings here below; But heartily wished that he
						might have no long and serious sickness in order not to give his <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> any trouble, which Request be clear <roleName
							type="honorific">Lord</roleName> granted him like wise: for when on the <date type="death" when-iso="1759-12-16">16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Dec.</date> he went to
						Bed about 9 o&apos;Clock in the Evening, he slept till about 1 o&apos;Clock in the Morning, and at 2 o&apos;Clock his Soul </p>
