            <lb/>The course of Life of our Dear B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> William Birkhead
            <lb/>who departed this Life March the 13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1771
            <lb/>our Dear B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r </hi>William Birkhead was born Sept. 29. 1703
            <lb/>At Dighton, in the Parish of Huddersfield, where he was brought
            <lb/>up to the Church of England. He learned the clothiers Trade;
            <lb/>But he did not Follow it long, before he Took wholly To
            <lb/>Husbandery, in which he continu'd for the Chief part of his
            <lb/>Life. but when his Strength Fail'd him for that Employment
            <lb/>He Took to carding &amp; Spining, whereby he got his Bread at home
            <lb/>with his Dear Wife. prettily &amp; Honestly till with in a few days
            <lb/>of His End. He left us nothing in Writing from under his own
            <lb/>Hand, concerning his Life, therefore: we trust content ourselves
            <lb/>with The Following. In the year 1740 he was awakened 
            <lb/>at Dighton, in which little Place, the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> kept <hi rend="underlined:true;">there</hi> Meetings, and
            <lb/>Settled a little Society. In the year 1758 he was receiv'd into the
            <lb/>Society here in Mirfield. April the 4<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1763. He was at Fulneck
            <lb/>receiv'd into the cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n.</hi> went the first time to the Holy comunion
            <lb/>at Fulneck in 1766. April 26. He was Married in 1726 To Hanah
            <lb/>Ainley the present Widow; their Marriage was Bless'd with
            <lb/>9 Children, 4 Boys, &amp; 5 Girls. 6 are gone home; 2 Daughters
            <lb/>are in the Choir House at Fulneck; and one Son is with
            <lb/>The B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> in North carolina. our Happily departed B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> was
            <lb/>of a Still and Bashful Turn of Mind, and not apt to Push
            <lb/>Himself for ward as Some are; and left the Disposal of himself
            <lb/>quite to the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> with regard to his Degrees in the cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n.</hi> and on
            <lb/>the other hand: the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> are also well known that they are not over
            <lb/>Hasty with regard to reception into the cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n.</hi> and admission to the
            <lb/>L.S. and this between them both; the Time was Protracted to an
            <lb/>unusual length, which appears from the Date of his awakening
            <lb/>1740. To his reception in to the cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> in 1753. however our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi>
            <lb/>knows best how to lead those whom He will make his own; and
            <lb/>This is a sufficient reason for us to believe that it was the right
            <lb/>way, &amp; the best. our dear B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Birkhead Enjoy'd a pretty good.
            <lb/>Share of Health in General, but about 4 months ago, Symptoms
            <lb/>of a Dropsy appear'd, yet so Favourable, that he could do
            </p>

            <p>
            <lb/>His Work to the last. He was not confin'd to his Bed above 2 or 3
            <lb/>Days, which is a Wonder in such Disorders. He came to the
            <lb/>Chapel to the Holy Comunion: almost to the last; and had it but
            <lb/>once brought home to his House, where he Enjoy'd it with his dear Wife
            <lb/>with a believing &amp; Hungery heart; and beg'd Sincerely: that he
            <lb/>might Enjoy it the Next with our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r.</hi> He was an Honest, Simple
            <lb/>and Childlike B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> a Man of very few Words: but His unexceptionable
            <lb/>Walk and conduct Spoke for him, and gain'd him the Esteem,
            <lb/>and Sincere love of all the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> &amp; Sisters in the cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n.</hi>
            <lb/>Most commonly at Speaking with him before the com<hi rend="superscript:true;">ion</hi>; he was
            <lb/>Found in a State, &amp; Situation of Heart &amp; Mind: which was a joy to his
            <lb/>The Labourer. He thought of Himself as becomoth a Sinner: that he
            <lb/>was unworthy, of the least of Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Mercies, &amp; Favours. He often
            <lb/>Wonder'd at his call to the People, and Esteem'd it a particular
            <lb/>Lot of Grace, that he belong'd to the Church of God. He was a Meek
            <lb/>and Patient Heart during his Sickness. the 13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> Instant after
            <lb/>The Meeting: I was told, that he was very Low, and would Probably
            <lb/>not over live the Night, &amp; that he desir'd to see me: it was
            <lb/>most violent weather, however: I went, and made Him my last
            <lb/>visit, and some very tender, &amp; Hearty conversation with Him
            <lb/>in the End of which: I Bless'd for his departure, gave Him a
            <lb/>a Kiss, &amp; my leave of Him, and to Him, to Morrow I Shall be
            <lb/>oblig'd to be from home, but that my Heart &amp; Prayers should
            <lb/>conduct him to the very Door of his Eternal rest. the
            <lb/>very same Night about 10. o'clock, He fell Softly &amp; Happily
            <lb/>asleep, in the 68 year of His age. Saturday 16 we want to His House
            <lb/>and Sung some verses with a Happy feeling: then the corpse
            <lb/>was carried to Fulnek.
