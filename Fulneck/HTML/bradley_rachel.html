      <p> The single S<sup>r</sup><a href="#mlper000222.html">Rachel Bradley</a> who hap- <br></br> pilydeparted this life<em>Aug. 30<sup>th</sup> 1809</em>. <br></br> has left the following short account: <br></br> I was born in <a href="#mlpla000235.html">Goweer in the parish <br></br> of Huddersfield</a><em>Oct 15<sup>th</sup> 1742</em>. Shortly <br></br> before I was born, my Mother began <br></br> to attend the meetings of the B<sup>rn</sup>;;<br></br> and as soon as she possibly could <br></br>
         						she took me to the meetings too, the <br></br> first time I remember having any serious <br></br> thoughts concerning our Saviour was <br></br> in my <em>6<sup>th</sup> year</em>, when <a href="#mlper000689.html">B<sup>r</sup> Hauptman</a><br></br> was Keeping as a Childrens meeting: <br></br> He spoke so movingly about the suf <br></br> ferings &amp; death of our Saviour that it <br></br> made a deep impression on my mind. <br></br> It
         						being Good friday, he told us that <br></br> this was the day when the Lord died <br></br> to redeem us out of the hand of the <br></br> destroyer,
         						telling us to pray to our Sa- <br></br> viour to make us good &amp; happy Chil- <br></br> dren, and give us a Heart
         						to love him. <br></br> I <del>prayed if</del> thought, so I will, &amp; prayed <br></br>fervently, so that I felt him very near</p>PAGE BREAK
      <p>to my heart. Going to Bed at night I <br></br> thought I saw our Saviour, he
         							showed <br></br> me his hands &amp; his feet, and I felt <br></br> such a love to him, that I beg'd <br></br> of him to take me to himself.<br></br> In my <em>8<sup>th</sup> year</em> my Parents being in <br></br> very low circumstances, my Oncle and <br></br> Aunt payed us a
         						visit, and offered <br></br> to take one of us Children to their <br></br> house, my Aunt fixed her choice on <br></br> me, to my great grief, because
         						she <br></br> had no liking for the B<sup>rn</sup>. As <br></br> my Parents insisted
         						upon me going <br></br> I went out of obedience, but spent <br></br> 2 very unhappy years. My <a href="#mlper000370.html">B<sup>r</sup> Richard</a><br></br> coming from <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulnek</a> about that time <br></br> gave me an oppertunity to aquaint <br></br> him with the uneasiness of my mind, <br></br> I told him that I should never go <br></br> to Heaven if I remained here. He <br></br> asked me where I should wish to <br></br> be? I answered any where among the <br></br>B<sup>rn</sup>. My inclination was to live <br></br> with the S. S<sup>rs</sup>, but could not see </p>
      <p> how it was possible to be brought about. <br></br> Being one Night very uneasy, I kneel- <br></br> ed down by my bed, and prayed <br></br> to our
         							Saviour with many tears, that <br></br> if is was his mind for me to live <br></br> with the S<sup>rs</sup> he would make it <br></br> known to me, by putting it into <br></br> my Mothers heart, to come and see <br></br>
         						me, that I might tell her all <br></br> the trouble of my mind; to my <br></br>great surprise she came next mor- <br></br> ning, I was struk, and thanked<sup>to</sup> the <br></br>Lord, because I knew it was his doing. <br></br> When she asked me how I did <br></br> I answered; very well!
         						she said she <br></br> was glad to hear it, for she suffered <br></br> much on my account the last night <br></br> &amp;
         						could have no ease of mind till <br></br> she knew what was the matter <br></br> with me. I inquired about her re- <br></br> turn, she told me in the
         						afternoon, <br></br> I took no farther notice, but dressed <br></br> myself to go with her, on seing what <br></br> I was about she wished me not to </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> do it, saying my Father would be much <br></br> displeased, not withstanding I set <br></br> out, but my Mother using all manners <br></br> of
         						persuasion for me to remain where <br></br> I was, I told her that I could not <br></br> return, unless she spoke with <a href="#mlper000328.html">B<sup>r</sup><br></br>Pyrlaus</a> concerning me, which she faith <br></br> fully promised to do, &amp; I returned to my <br></br> Oncle &amp; Aunt who rec<sup>d</sup> me gladly, telling <br></br> me that I was beloved by them as <br></br> their own Child. I
         							thanked them for <br></br> their Kindness towards me, but aquaint- <br></br> ed them with nothing farther. My
         						<br></br> Mother fulfilled her promise, spoke <br></br> to the B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; they soon found a place <br></br> for
         						me, my S<sup>r</sup> came to fetch me <br></br> &amp; I felt very thankful to the Lord<br></br> for what he had done for me. <br></br> The next day we came to <a href="#mlpla000094.html">Little town</a><br></br> where I remained for a short time, <br></br> from thence I obtained leave to live <br></br> in <a href="#mlpla000041.html">Gummersal</a> S<sup>rs</sup> House, and after <br></br> living 2 years there, I removed to <br></br><a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulnek</a>. Now indeed my heart was <br></br> melted before our Saviour, seing with <br></br></p>
      <p> what unwearied Kindness &amp; patience<del>our  Saviour</del> he has followed me, I shed <br></br> sinner tears before him, and intreated <br></br> him fervently to keep &amp; protect me <br></br> during my pilgrimage here below; <br></br> &amp; I must own to his praise that he has <br></br>
         						never left nor forsaken me, I feel my <br></br> self a very great sinner, but hope thro' <br></br> his enabling grace I shall
         						give joy to <br></br> our Saviour &amp; his Cong<sup>n</sup>. I my <em>15<sup>th</sup><br></br> year</em>I had the favour to be rec<sup>d</sup><br></br> into the Cong<sup>n</sup>which proved a great <br></br> blessingto my heart. But now the <br></br> depravity of human nature began to <br></br> show itself more &amp; more. I felt a great <br></br> inclination to
         							enjoy the pleasures of this <br></br> world &amp; often thought of going back &amp; <br></br> leave the Cong<sup>n</sup>; I grew also very re- <br></br> served, so that I could not open <br></br> my heart to any one. But my
         						ever <br></br> faithful Saviour<sup>followed</sup> me his poor Child <br></br> with unwearied Kindness &amp; made it <br></br> clear to me that it was his will that

         						the <br></br>forgiveness of all my sins. I now <br></br> returned home happy and comfort- <br></br>
         							able, in the nearness of my mercyful<br></br>Saviour, he also gave me grace that <br></br> without reserve I could open my <br></br> mind to my Choir. Labores. wishing<br></br> to keep noting hid which might hin- <br></br> der my cource of grace. I felt now <br></br> a great desire to
         							enjoy the Holy <br></br> Com<sup>n</sup> and this great favour was gran <br></br> to me in
         							my <em>22<sup>d</sup> year</em>. And now <br></br> I wish for nothing else, but to re- <br></br>

      <p> Thus far her own Account, which she dictated <br></br> to a friend in the <em>year 1805</em>. and added <br></br> at the same time, that this short acc<sup>t</sup><br></br> given of her early life had been the <br></br> most remarkable to her, and the period <br></br> in which she sought &amp; found real <br></br>
         							happiness, &amp; tho' more then 40 years <br></br> had elaps'd since, during which time <br></br>much had occurred yet she could say <br></br> nothing more, but thank and praise our <br></br>
         						our Saviour for all his love &amp; care. &amp; <br></br> forbearence, midst all her ailments and <br></br>
         						shortfallings. We can add to this, <br></br> that she was devoted with soul &amp; body <br></br> to the Lord, his
         							suffering beauty had cap- <br></br> tivated her heart, to read &amp; speak about that <br></br>
         						subject was her greatest dilight, she was also <br></br> useful in several ways, &amp; served with a willing <br></br> &amp; chearful heart. Tho' she had a very sickly <br></br> tabernacle, and was several times so ill that <br></br>no hopes was left for her recovery, yet she <br></br> was resigned to our Saviours will, and could <br></br> never express her graditute sufficenly for his <br></br> help &amp; support both internal &amp;
         						external. <br></br> Of late years she was much troubled with an </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p>asmatick complaint, but she bore it with <br></br>great patience, &amp; sought comfort with him <br></br> who has been her refuce in all trouble. <br></br> As she loved &amp; was beloved it was a pleasure<br></br> to her to be in her room with the S<sup>rs</sup> as <br></br> long as she was able to go down, but about <br></br> 3 weeks before her departure she was
         						obliged to <br></br> confine herself to the sickroom. She expressed <br></br> herself on that occation, to the following effect: <br></br> "I have now done with all things in this world
         						<br></br> and am waiting for our Saviour to take me <br></br> to my eternal home, I am lost in wonder when <br></br>
         						I think on his love &amp; faithfulness, to me the <br></br> poorest among the needy, O what a blessed thing <sup>it is,</sup><br></br> that he has given me that asurence | tho I deserv'd <br></br> hell | that he will receive me in the blessed<br></br> man<del>t</del><sup>s</sup>ions above, I will then greet his feet with <br></br> sinner tears &amp; say to him; This Lord<a href=".html">Jesus</a> is <br></br> my only plea, Here is a sinner who would <br></br> fain - Thro the Lambs ransom
         						entrance gain. <br></br> With these happy meditations she spent her time, <br></br> | tho' she suffered much of
         						shortness of breath | till <br></br><em>Aug 30<sup>th</sup></em> when it pleased our Saviour
         						in a <br></br>happy &amp; gentle manner to take her home to him <br></br> self. <sup>Aged</sup> 66 years 10 Months 15 days. </p>PAGE BREAK</body>
