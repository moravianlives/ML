My Parents <del>was</del> <add place="above">were</add> of the <lb/>
					<orgName religion="Anglican">Church of England</orgName> wherein I was <name event="baptism">Baptiz'd</name> &amp; brought up. In my Childhood <lb/>
					I was convinced of sin &amp; felt I was not right &amp; alreadly then believed that I must <lb/>
					attain to something at yet unpossess'd, or I could not be saved.  My natural diss- <lb/>
					position was flighty so that what <name emotion="tender">tender</name> impressions I had in my heart, <del>was</del> <add place="above">were</add> <lb/>
					of short duration. When I was <date cert="medium" when="1758">13 years old</date> a Discenting Gentlewoman took <lb/>
					me into her family, where I was instructed in <del>those</del> <add place="above">the</add> principles <add place="above">of that denomination</add>; I read their <lb/>
					Bookes &amp; particularly Backesters Call to the unconverted, which <name emotion="frighten'd">frighten'd</name> <lb/>
					me exceedingly, for I felt I fell short of all righteousness, &amp; therefore endeavour'd <lb/>
					to reform my life by more strict observance of my duty, especially by reading, <lb/>
					praying &amp; frequenting the meetings, which I prefer'd before those of the <lb/>
					E. Church, because I thought these people were more sincere. In <date when="1730" cert="high">1730</date> my <lb/>
					Father being sick I visited him &amp; was <name emotion="greatly concerned">greatly concerned</name> for his Salvation, <lb/>
					&amp; therefore kneel'd down by his bed, read &amp; pray'd by him, putting the Bible <lb/>
					into his Hands, when he open'd to that portion of Scripture, Remember <lb/>
					thy <roleName type="honorific">Creator</roleName> in the days of thy youth, that when thou art old he may <lb/>
					not be hid from thine Eyes. This <name emotion="so affected me">so Affected me</name> that I immediately rose up, <lb/>

					In <date when="1733" cert="high">1733</date> my Lady also departed &amp; I return'd to <placeName ref="#mlpla000054" cert="high">London</placeName>, where I waited on 2 <lb/>

					by the late <del>Disciple</del> <add place="above">ordinary of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></add> in <placeName ref="#mlpla000139" cert="high">German</placeName> which <persName ref="#mlper000602" cert="high" type="real"><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Spaningburg</persName> interpreted <lb/>

					I soon understood they were the pilgrims that I was come to see. <lb/>
					My coming to the <orgName religion="Moravian Church">B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> was kept secret from the family for 3/4 of a <lb/>
					year till at length they got intelligence that I went after a religious <lb/>

					me very strictly about the <orgName religion="Moravian Church">B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>, &amp; ask'd me whether I realy knew that I <lb/>
					was going among a pearcel of strolers. I told him he must be mistaken <lb/>
					for I was convinc'd they were Child<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of <persName type="real" cert="high">God</persName>; he said how had I come <lb/>
					to this knowledge? I told him I had <name emotion="felt it in my heart">felt it in my heart</name>, that there was <lb/>
					no salvation but in the Gospel they preached thro' <name emotion="faith">faith</name> in our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> <lb/>

					preserved from outward transgressions &amp; knew I must have <name emotion="forgiveness">forgiveness</name> <lb/>
					otherwise I cou'd not saved. He ask'd me many more questions, so that <lb/>
					at length I grew quite weary went &amp; fetch'd him all the Books that <lb/>

					atentively &amp; then return them again; with this I left him at that time <lb/>
					but in a few days he sent for me to his House return'd me the Books and <lb/>
					saying he would have me consider it well over before I left the <lb/>
					Church. I told him, I knew what I was about, as also the people &amp; <lb/>

							<del>Continuation of the life of Sarah Gurney <lb/>
							I have to add the following</del>: Since I came into the <orgName en="single sisters choir">single sisters</orgName> house <lb/>
							at <placeName ref="#mlpla000003" cert="high">Fulneck</placeName> the <roleName type="honorific">Holy Ghost</roleName> took me into his school, &amp; showed me that <lb/>
							I ought to <name emotion="love">love</name> our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> more than I did &amp; that I had not that <name emotion="earnest">earnest</name> <lb/>
							<name emotion="desire">desire</name> which I should have for the manifestation of his <name emotion="love">love</name> to me. Though <lb/>
							he had followed me from my infancy, yet now he discovered my depravity <lb/>
							poverty &amp; helplessness returning my abode in the sisters house in a particular <lb/>
							manner, I was in <name emotion="darkness">darkness</name> sometimes through unbelief &amp; the <name emotion="feeling of my misery">feeling of my
<lb/>
misery</name>, &amp; if it one not for his <name emotion="love">love</name> &amp; <name emotion="pitty">pitty</name> he would have taken his <name emotion="grace">grace</name> from</p><p><lb/>
							me but he did not, but from time to time helped me, letting me see clearly <lb/>
							that without him there is <name emotion="no happiness">no happiness</name>, I felt my lost estate but he drew me <lb/>
							near to himself &amp; did not let me <name emotion="rest">rest</name> till I could by <name emotion="faith">faith</name> apply his <add place="above">Atone</add> <lb/>
							ments <add place="above">to myself</add> &amp; know that I was his &amp; he was mine. If I had been <lb/>
							more faithful to his leading I should have experienced <name emotion="more happiness">more happiness</name> &amp; have <lb/>
							been more to his honor. I am still his poor child. I see &amp; feel my sinfulness <lb/>
							&amp; that so very slowly toward the mark I press, but <persName type="real" cert="high">Jesus</persName> <name emotion="comforts">comforts</name> me, who out <lb/>
							<name emotion="mercy">mercy</name> free me all my <name emotion="guilt">guilt</name> with <name emotion="patience">patience</name> in the accursed tree. Now my <lb/>
							hearts inclination is a deep prostration for my <roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> <name emotion="pain">pain</name>, To be therby <lb/>
							<name emotion="melted">melted</name> so that each one felt it how I <name emotion="love">love</name> that Man. May his <name emotion="love">love</name> be <lb/>

							<del>from here to eternity</del> though I shall fall short in time &amp; eternity. I can <lb/>
							never <name emotion="praise">praise</name> <add place="above">him</add> sufficiently for what he has done to me his worthy child. <lb/>
							His <roleName type="honorific">Holy Spirit</roleName> often reproved <add place="above">me,</add> but when with <name emotion="contrition">contrition</name> I <add place="above">owned all</add> to him, he <lb/>
							<name emotion="forgave">forgave</name> me again, In short I live by his <name emotion="forgiveness">forgiveness</name>. He <del>I was</del> <add place="above">cared</add> for me <lb/>
							with <add place="above">the</add> <name emotion="tenderness">tenderness</name> of a Mother. O that I could <name emotion="praise">praise</name> my heavenly Father and my <lb/>
							<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> <del>&amp; I could</del> better than I do! O that I <del>did</del> <add place="above">might</add> never forget his <name emotion="mercies">mercies</name> to me <lb/>
							<del>which alas I have often done</del> <del>by he</del> <add place="above">and tho' I have often to my great loss been forgetful, yet he</add> my great <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> still remained the same <lb/>
							For <del>was</del> <add place="above">which I now</add> will <name emotion="praise">praise</name> him as well as I can, &amp; <del>will</del> <add place="above">shall</add> do it better when I see him. <lb/>
