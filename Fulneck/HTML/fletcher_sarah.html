    <h2>Sarah Fletcher</h2>
    <p>I was born <em>July 2<sup>nd</sup> 1820</em> at <a href="#mlpla000129.html">Mapperley, <br /> a small village in Derbyshire</a>. My dear <br /> Mother being a decided child of <a href=".html"
        >God</a><br /> endeavoured to bring her chldren up <br /> in the nurture and admonition of the <br />Lord; and I do not <del>rember</del> remember the <br /> time when my thoughts were not
        <sup>wont to</sup><br /> dwell upon serious things; but alas they <br /> were too much of a reasoning <sup>sceptical</sup> nature. <br /> Very little took place during my childhood <br /> that
      is worth<del>y of</del> recording; I had the priviledge <br /> of attending a small School, that was kept <br /> by the daughters of a most worthy and <br /> excellent Independant Minister,
      whose <br />loving and affectionate manner will ever <br /> be sweet to my memory. I attended their <br /> School untill I was in my <em>14<sup>th</sup> Year</em><br /> when my dear Mother
      placed me in the <br /><a href="#mlpla000268.html">Srs House at Ockbrook</a>. where, after a <br /> few weeks I became exceedingly happy <br /> and comfortable the life of a S<sup>rs</sup> House
        <br /><del>House</del> being well adapted to my nature </p>

    <p>cheerful, yet somewhat <sup>reserved</sup><del>timid</del> dispos- <br /> ition. In the beginning of <em>37</em> I
      received <br /> with several others of my companions, <br /> instruction for confirmation, or rather <br /> in my case for Adult baptism, my <br /> dear Mother being a baptist I had <br />
      consequently not received that sacrament<br /> in infancy; but I cannot say that <br /> either the instructions or the rite <br /> itself made any lasting impressions <br /> upon my mind; I
      enjoyed the instruc <br /> tions, as I did, imbibing knowledge <br /> of any kind that came in my reach. <br /> Unaware almost to myself, I formed <br /> my own views on <del>religous</del> the
      way of <br /> Salvation, and as might be expected <br /> stumbled upon many errors, At one time <br /> instead of simply going to <a href=".html">Jesus</a>, I was seeking the fruits of the
      Spirit and <br /> at another I was fully impressed with the <br /> idea, that tho' I was very very far from <br /> what I ought to be as a christian, yet I <br /> must wait the Lord's time to
      make <br /> me different, I could do nothing. At this </p>
    <p> time "Baxters Saints Rest" fell into my <br /> hands, which by the blessing of the Lord<br /> made a very deep impression on my mind <br /> and showed me that there was much for <br /> me to
      do, viz an earnestness of spirit, and <br /> a determination to give the Lord no rest <br /> till he was graciouslypleased to reveal <br /> himself to me. From this time I was much <br /> more
      in earnest, but my adorable Saviour<br /> was not my all in all; consequently the <br /> way seemed long and <sup>hear I</sup> often felt inclined <br /> to exclaim "who is sufficent for these
      things! <br /> In the year <em>50</em> I received a call to be the <br />Warden of the Single Sisters in <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, <br /> and tho' deeply conscious of my own
      insuff- <br /> iciency for such a post, I felt such a strong <br /> conviction that it was from the Lord<br /> I dared do no other than accept it. In the <br /> first year I had many trials and
      difficulties <br /> caused in a great measure by my own <br /> inexperience, but afterwards my working <br />very pleasant, and light to me. <em>The <br /> Year after</em>I came to <a
        href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, the texts for </p>
    
    PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> my birthday struck me very much on <br /> looking at them sometime before. The <br /> daily word was "In the Lord shall
      all <br /> the seed of <a href="#mlpla000075.html">Israel</a> be justified and <sup>glory</sup> shall <br /> 45<sup>th</sup> of <a href="#mlpla000075.html">Isaiah</a> &amp; 25<sup>th</sup>
      verse, and the doctrinal <br /> text was, the second of Acts &amp; the latter part <br /> of the 47<sup>th</sup> verse "And the Lord added to <br /> the church daily such as should be saved."
      <br /> I felt to hope that these texts had a reference <br /> to some that were very near &amp; dear to me, who <br /> were not added to any christian church, <br /> and over whom my heart had
      often yearned. <br /> I never once thought of them in connection <br /> with myself, I thought I was added to the <br /> church, and of the real meaning of the <br /> daily word I had at that
      time very little <br /> knowledge, oh how possible it is to deceive <br /> ourselves and others. On the morning of my <br /> birthday, I found three verses on my table <br /> which had been
      drawn and placed there <br /> by a very dear and worthy sister, as was <br /> her custom, the three were very striking, but <br /> the text of one was <del>love</del> "Lovest thou me" </p>
    <p> to <sup>which</sup> was added the verse </p>
    <p>Lovest thou me I hear the Saviour say,Would that my heart had power to answer yea: Thou knowest all things, Lord in heaven aboveAnd earth beneath, thou knowest that I loveBut 'tis not so in
      word, in deed, in thoughtI do not cannot love thee as I ought,Thy love must give that power, thy love alone </p>
    <p> On reading the last line <sup>with clasped hands</sup> I exclaimed, oh <br /> my belovedSaviour that is the very thing <br /> why <sup>didst</sup> thou not show me that before. it is <br />
      indeed thy love that must give me power <br /> to love thee in return, there is indeed "nothing <br /> worthy of thee but thine own Oh do thou <br /> grant that "with the love wherewith thou
      lovest me </p>
    <p> Reflected on thyself I <del>would</del><sup>may</sup>love thee <br /> My dear Saviour had that instant drawn <br /> me to himself but when he put his holy <br /> spirit into my heart, oh the
      sink of iniquity <br /> I saw there "sin did indeed revive and <br /> I died" Rom 7<sup>th</sup> ch 9<sup>th</sup> verse. So heavy was the </p>
    
    PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p>weight of guilt upon me, that I often
      <br /> felt I must sink under it, or that I should <br /> lose my senses; I stood a guilty hell deserving <br /> sinner, and felt that I must be lost, if my <br />Saviour had not died for me;
      but I could <br /> take no comfort, the promises were as tho' <br /> I had never heard them, except occasionally<br /> a text such as Line is crossed out in pencil, what is written above is
      illegible"I will not always strive with Line is crossed out in pencil, what is written above is illegibleman least the Spirit which I have made <br /> should fail before me" was as a little
      gleam <br /> of sunshine, and then the cloud passed <br /> over again. I remained in this state of <br /> mind some Weeks, till one sunday evening <br /> the text was from some part of John's
      first <br /> Epistle, but what chapter or verse I have <br /> no recollection from the distressed state of <br /> my mind. During the sermon I earnestly<br /> besought the Lord to reveal himself
      to me, <br /> And he did, the peace and joy that I felt <br /> that night, none but a pardoned sinner<br /> can have any conception of I had not a <br /> shadow of a doubt of my acceptance in
      the <br />Beloved. And tho' <a href=".html">God</a> has not at all times </p>
    <p> been in my thoughts, yet my beloved<br />Saviour has never suffered my feet to slide <br /> O thou who hast begun a good work in <br /> me, do thou perfect it unto the end. <br /> Oh do thou
      empty me of myself, and fill <br /> me with thyself be thou my all in all <br /><em>185<del>7</del>5</em> I again devote myself body soul &amp; <br /> spirit unto thee dear Saviour, but oh
      <br /> do thou keep me, thou know'st how weak <br /> and frail I am, how prone to stray from <br /> thee, and how contrary I continually act <br /> to thy mind. </p> <p>Thus far her own</p>
    <p>In addition to what our late Sister<br /> has stated her fellow laborer adds <br /> the following on behalf of herself <br /> &amp; the choir, &amp; can truly say, that <br /> both she and
      every inmate of the <br /> house, feel that they have lost <br /> in our late Sister, a sincere and <br /> valued friend &amp; conscientious <br />Christian. </p>
    
    PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> Upright in
      principle &amp; faithful <br /> in business, she did all she had <br /> to do, with a single eye to the interest <br /> of the concern she was entrusted <br /> with, &amp; never for an hour,
      would <br /> sacrifice duty to pleasure.</p>
    <p> To be unexpectedly called upon to <br /> part with a friend so faithful <br /> &amp; untiring in her exertions for the <br /> good of the whole household, does <br /> indeed fill all our
      hearts with sorrow, <br /> We deeply mourn our loss, but we <br /> cannot but say, that our loss is her <br /> eternal gain. She knew in whom <br /> she believed, &amp; when the summons <br />
      came for her to lay by her earthly <br /> duties, she was enabled to say: "Thy <br /> will be done!" And we doubt not <br /> would hear the welcome: "Well <br /> done good &amp; faithful
      servant, enter <br /> thou into the joy of thy Lord!"</p>
    <p> As a fellow laborer &amp; member of our <br />Elders' Conference, our dear <a href="#mlper000242.html">S<sup>r</sup> Fletcher</a><br /> was much esteemed by us all, for <br /> the candour of
      her mind, &amp; her </p>
    <p> strictly conscientious discharge <br /> of her official duties. She would ever <br /> openly &amp; clearly state her views on <br /> any subject she was interested in, <br /> &amp; in case of
      a difference of opinion <br /> firmly &amp; faithfully maintain her <br /> cause, without however in the least <br /> being self opinionated or obstinate.</p>
    <p> Her warm interest in the Lords work <br /> &amp; the spread of His kingdom, both <br /> at home &amp; abroad, she quietly, <br /> yet continuously manifested, not <br /> only unto the Searcher
      of hearts, who <br />delights to hear the prayers of his <br /> people, when they plead with him <br /> for the furtherance of his gospel, but <br /> also unto man, by the lively &amp;
      intelligent <br /> interest she always displayed in <br /> conversations on the subject of <br /> missionary labours, &amp; by her untiring <br /> &amp; successful endeavours, to collect <br />
      subscriptions for such objects, as the <br />Foreign &amp; Home Missions, the Bible <br /> Society &amp; so forth. The local committees <br /> of these associations, will miss in her <br /> a
      valued member, &amp; a successful <br /> collector. </p>
    
    PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> We were often struck with her correct <br /> memory of men &amp; things, relating <br /> to Missionary enterprises,
      especially <br /> those connected with our own <br /> Church, of which she was a very <br /> consistent &amp; attached member. </p>
    <p> She also took her place as a teacher <br /> in our Sunday school, &amp; by her <br /> prayerful &amp; careful preparation for <br /> her work, succeeded in securing the <br />love &amp;
      gratitude of her scholars, to <br /> whose hearts her memory is much <br /> endeared by her valued instructions <br /> in spiritual things. </p>
    <p> She now rests from her labours, &amp; <br /> her works do follow her. Whatever <br /> she did, she did unto the Lord, <br /> &amp; this imparted real worth to her <br /> activity. Her memory
      is dear to<br /> us. </p>
    <p> When the Minister of the Cong<sup>n</sup> saw <br /> her on the evening of the so called <br /> "Sisters' coming in day," she was <br /> remarkably calm &amp; cheerful in her <br /> mind,
      &amp; resigned to the Lord, who <br /> had laid her on a bed of sickness, </p>
    <p> while the other inmates of the <br /> house, were holding their festive<br /> meetings in the adjoining prayer <br /> hall. For the visit paid to her <br /> &amp; the prayer offered up by her
      bed <br /> side, she expressed her thanks in <br /> a very cordial &amp; lively manner. <br /> Little did the Minister think, that <br /> on his return from Crook, whither <br /> duty called him
      away for several <br /> days, he should no longer be permitted <br /> to see her among the living.</p>
    <p> To a fellow laborer who visited her <br /> late on Sunday evening, &amp; who engaged <br /> in spiritual conversation &amp; prayer <br /> with the dear patient, she remarked <br /> on his
      enquiry, if she felt her Saviour<br /> near, that He was her only real <br />comfort &amp; true support: "for what <br /> should I do without him now?" <br /> And truly He was with her in her
      <br /> last hour. Her own memoir tells <br /> us, that she knew in whom she believed. <br />Trusting in his merits, &amp; saved by his <br /> bloods hedding &amp; death, she gently fell <br />
      asleep in <a href=".html">Jesus</a> to be for ever with <br /> the Lord</p>

    <p> I was born July 2<sup>nd</sup> 1820 at <br /> Mapperly, a small village in <br /> Derbyshire. </p>
    <p> My dear mother being a decided <br /> child of God endeavoured to <br /> bring her children up in the <br /> nurture &amp; admonition of the <br /> Lord; &amp; I do not remember the <br />
      time when my thoughts were <br /> not wont to dwell upon serious <br /> things; but, alas! they were too <br /> much of a reasoning, sceptical <br /> nature. Very little took place <br /> during
      my childhood that is <br /> worth recording. I had the <br /> privilege of attending a small <br /> school, that was kept by the <br /> daughters of a most worthy &amp; <br /> excellent
      Independent Minister, <br /> whose loving &amp; affectionate manner, </p>
    
    PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> will ever be sweet to my memory. <br /> I attended their school until I was <br /> in my 14<sup>th</sup>
      year, when my dear Mother <br /> placed me in the S<sup>rs</sup> house at <br /> Ockbrook, - where, after a few weeks, <br /> I became exceedingly happy and <br /> comfortable, the life of a
        S<sup>rs</sup> house <br /> being well adapted to my naturally <br /> cheerful, yet somewhat reserved <br /> disposition. </p>
    <p> In the beginning of 1837 I received, <br /> with several others of my companions, <br /> instruction for confirmation, or rather <br /> in my case for adult baptism. <br /> My dear Mother
      being a Baptist <br /> I had consequently not received <br /> that sacrament in infancy. </p>
    <p> But I cannot say that either the <br /> instructions, or the rite itself, made <br /> any lasting impression on my mind. <br /> I enjoyed the instructions, as I did <br /> imbibing knowledge
      of any kind that <br /> came in my reach. </p>
    <p> Unawares almost to my self, I formed <br /> my own views on the way of salvation, <br /> &amp; as might be expected stumbled upon <br /> many errors. At one time I was <br />seeking fruits of
      the Spirit, instead of </p>
    <p> simply going to Jesus, &amp; At another <br /> time I was fully impressed with the <br /> idea, that though I was <br /> very very far from what I ought <br /> to be as a Christian, yet I must
      <br /> wait the Lord's time to make me <br /> different, I could do nothing. At <br /> this time "Baxter's saints' rest" <br /> fell into my hands, which by <br /> the blessing of the Lord made
      a <br /> very deep impression on my mind, <br /> &amp; showed me that there was much <br /> for me to do, viz. an earnestness of <br /> Spirit, &amp; a determination to give <br /> the Lord no
      rest, till he was gra- <br /> ciously pleased to reveal himself <br /> to me. From this time I was<br /> much more in earnest, but my <br /> adorable Saviour was not my all <br /> in all;
      consequently the way seemed <br /> long &amp; heavy &amp; I often felt inclined <br /> to exclaim: "Who is sufficent for <br /> these things!" </p>
    <p> In the year 1850 I received a call <br /> to be the Warden of the S<sup>le</sup> S<sup>rs</sup> in Fulneck, <br /> &amp; though deeply conscious of my own <br /> insufficiency for such a post,
      I felt </p>
    
    PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> such a strong conviction that it <br /> was from the Lord, that I dared <br /> do no other than accept it. </p>
    <p> In the first year I had many trials <br /> and difficulties, caused in a great <br /> measure by my own inexperience, <br /> but afterwards my work was very <br /> pleasant &amp; light to me. </p>
    <p> The 2<sup>nd</sup> year after I came to Fulneck, <br /> the texts for my birthday struck me <br /> very much, on looking at them some <br /> time before. The daily word was: <br /> "In the
      Lord shall all the seed of <br /> Israel be justified &amp; shall glory. Is. 45.25 <br /> &amp; the doctrinal text was, the second of Acts <br /> &amp; the latter part of the 47<sup>th</sup>
      verse: "And the <br /> Lord added to the Church daily such as <br /> should be saved." I felt to hope, that <br /> these texts had a reference to some, that <br /> were very near &amp; dear to
      me, who were <br /> not added to any <del>Church</del> Christian <br /> Church, &amp; over whom my heart had <br /> often yearned. I never thought of <br /> them in connexion with myself, <br />
      I thought I was added to the Church, <br /> &amp; of the real meaning of the daily word <br /> I had at that time very little knowledge. <br /> O! how possible it is it is to deceive ourselves
      <br /> &amp; others!. On the morning of my birthday </p>
    <p> I found three verses on my table <br /> which had been drawn &amp; placed <br /> there by a very dear &amp; worthy sister, <br /> as was her custom, the three were <br /> very striking. The
      text of one was <br /> "Lovest thou me?" To which was <br /> added the verse </p>
    <p>"Lovest thou me? I hear my Saviour say,"Would that my heart had power"to answer, yea, "Thou knowest all things, Lord inheaven above "And earth beneath, thou knowestthat I love! "But 'tis not
      so, - in word, in deed,in thought "I do not, cannot love thee as I ought;"Thy love must give that power; thy love alone!</p>
    <p> On reading the last line I exclaimed <br /> with clasped hands, Oh my beloved <br /> Saviour, that is the very thing <br /> Why didst thou not show me that <br /> before. It is indeed thy love
      that <br /> must give me power to love thee <br /> in return, there is indeed, "nothing <br /> worthy of thee but thine own" <br /> O do thou grant that "with the love <br /> wherewith thou
      lovest me, reflected <br /> on thyself I may love thee!" <br /> My dear Saviour, had that instant </p>
    
    PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> drawn me to himself but when <br /> he put his Holy Spirit into my heart
      <br /> Oh the sink of iniquity I saw there <br /> Sin did indeed revive &amp; I died <br /> Rom. 7:9. So heavy was the weight <br /> of guilt upon me, that I often felt <br /> I must sink under
      it, or that I should <br /> lose my senses. I stood a guilty <br /> hell deserving sinner, &amp; felt that I must <br /> be lost if my Saviour had not died <br /> for me, but I could take no
      comfort; <br /> the promises were as though I had <br /> never heard them; except occasionally <br /> a text such as "For I will not contend <br /> for ever, neither will I be always wroth:
      <br /> for the spirit should fail before me &amp; <br /> the souls which I have made" Is 57.16 <br /> was a little gleam of sunshine, &amp; then the <br /> cloud passed over again. I remained
      <br /> in this state of mind some weeks, till <br /> one Sunday evening, the text was <br /> from some part of John's first Epistle, <br /> but what chapter or verse I have no <br />
      recollection from the distressed state <br /> of my mind. During the sermon <br /> I earnestly besought the Lord to reveal <br /> himself to me, &amp; He did. The peace &amp; joy <br /> that I

    <p> of my acceptance in the Beloved. <br /> And though God has not at all <br /> times been in my thoughts, yet <br /> my beloved Saviour has never <br /> suffered my feet to slide. </p>
    <p> O thou who has begun a good work <br /> in me do thou perfect it unto the <br /> end. O do thou empty me of myself, <br /> &amp; fill me with thyself be thou <br /> my all in all. </p>

    <p> when they plead with him for the <br /> furtherance of his gospel, but also unto <br /> man, by the lively &amp; intelligent <br /> interest she always

      Foreign <br /> and Home Missions, the Bible Society, <br /> and so forth. The local Committees of <br /> these Associations will miss in her <br /> a valued member, and a successful <br />

      she was a very <br /> consistent &amp; attached member. </p>
    <p> She also took her place as a <br /> Teacher in our Sunday School, and <br /> by her prayerful and careful prepa- <br /> ration for her work succeeded in <br /> securing the love and gratitude
