also at a Time where work was very scarce which necessitited Her
mother to suffer Her to ask bread in the neighbouring families & also work
whose Benaovolence she often spoke of with the greatest Gratitude of
Heart & also at that time & tho yet a very blessd & dureing her childrens years she discovered our implicit atachment to our Savr & by
the Friendly countence of those neighbours who frequent the meeting kept by &
Mr Ingham at Horton kept the first meetings at Horton she thro' the freindly
Countenence of Her some in the neighbourhood, she got herself always into the

she wou'd love our Savr yes Even to her lives End; she also had the privildge
of enjoying the School kept by the Sisters wch was only 2 days in a week or
a forthnight & so prevent her being aprenticed by the town, she took very
diligently to work with her poor mother & Her the other Children & continued
so to do tell on all Occasion to acquire a decency of clothing necessary in hopes that 
she might still come into a nearer Connection with our Savr people she continued
in a steady perserverence to the Meeting & was recevd into the Great Girls Choir
at which Time she enjoy such a blessing & Special Grace from our Savrs precious nearness
that was an abiding Token to her heart that she was acceptd of by Him
which to made everything Else so in valuable to her that no perswations or
compasion had any long influence in Her course but on all occasions kept frequentd the childrens meeting which of any long dueration in the time

at her reception into the Sisters Choir, where she got a particular that she that her


was to live intirely ??? dear Savr & to become Subordinate to her Choir of Sisters
& His dear people of the Congregation, this followed her in all the
difficulties thrown her way by Her Relation from whom she had no
small Tryals to strugle with, yet she remaind low & little in Herself accounting
all  things good Enough for her If she cou'd but only keep Her she hold of Him Him
who had redeemd Her Soul from death & condemnation.
Novbr 13, 1753 she was recvd into the congregation for wch Grace she had
wept many Tears & Especially as Her Sister being recd before Her whose course & conduct
was no Edification it caused Her many a painful thought to see that Grace so
Little noticed; dureing those years between Her reception & communion she
had sickness at which Time she got a deeper insight into the great deficiny of Her own Heart 
which she openly Communicatd to some Sisters & said I must begin quite a new a poor
being also pretty Closely spoke to by Her Labourer who feard some indiffrency
was keeping in with Mary as she made no Speed to take seek a Sheltering place in Her
Choirhouse, her intireness of Heart soon closed in with the kind admonition & she
took a fresh determination to make short work & with her usual diligence & peufryers to get Her self in order & on Sept 4
1756 she had the Grace to become a perticipent of our dear Lords Corpses & blood
Sacrementuly, which So Strengthed her in Hearts the inward Course that she thought it
neither Life nor Sound to remain a moment longer in Her present Situation
yet was pervertd thro' various circumstances for its perceived she injoyd not that
Grace June 4 1756, which was she she has with a bowed & a thoughtful Heart confest & has remaind confirmed to be the most happy & most
agreable part of Her Lifes Course to thro' this & the following Testimonee of Her

poorest Times of Her course in the Choirhouse has given an Exemplary Testimonee of
a thankful heart even for the poorest Meals & Vituals she has been permitted to injoy amongst
us, which has put she Mary a dissatisfied Consience as to the Blush


she had the inspection of Room of Sisters & as Her conduct was plain Simple & undisguised
she felt mothers smart with real concern discoverd when she percived anything, that not was not becoming
it Causd those who had not yet Seen who had not yet seen or wou'd take yet see the Crooked
ness of there own & perversness of the Human Heart to get a dislike to Her Honer & 
plain way of acting, which caused gave Her often painful Hours, to see such their precious
moment trifled over & the previlidges of Grace so poorly made use of & Her
incessant prayer was that our Savr that our Savr might become their only objects
& then She was sure they wou'd have no resentment for Her conceit for she Love them much
& carryd no resentment, this 3 years past our dear Sister has been in a declining
State of Health & coud Earn little but ???? Her self in Her usual Manner
porpor____ Her Express with all thankfulness according to Her according according to Her
usual Manner as haveing every thing she wantd, & we had hopes that
Her disorder wou'd go off, & in the foregoing of Her departure it was
percived she had taken Cold, & not been careful over herself as Her
weakly Constitution did require yet she for continued her we usual work & went
into Her room as usual but on Sunday Last rec'd one day Thursday night she restd very poorly & had a voilent interval of
reuching to vomit & pain in Her head, & when helpd with anything on ??? Cryd always this is
quite Sufficient & restd a little & the following day was moved into the Sickroom
rested pritty well that night & in the morning complained of a pain in Her Bowels
which was presently follow'd with a continual Reuching, & the docter who was
very attentive to Her complaints found that the Medicine took not the least
had little words affect to Her releive, she constantly repeatd to the Sister who came to See Her
& also to those she sent for I shall Surely go to our dr Savr, thankd them for their
Love & desired them to pray for Her that she might have patience to wait Her
approaching hour, the Sisters was quite affectd at Her great Serenity of Her asked & the peacefull
feeling from our Savrs precious nearness
it being Speaking time to the communion, the Choir helper told Her what she
had been imployd in or she woud have been more present with Her, at which she
expressd Her Eager desire to pertake once more of the Body & blood of our Lord


which give ocasion for a Most Happy & Sinnerlike conversation between them as
following. My dear Srs Loral My Heart has been always one with you upon the death and
sufferings of My dearest Savr who has bore with me on all occasion & alone has
brought me thro', He has been my neverfailing Freind from first to Last, I
