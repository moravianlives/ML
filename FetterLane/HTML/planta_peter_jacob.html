    <h2>Peter Jacob Planta</h2>
    <p>Memoir of the Life of our late venerable &amp; <br />happily departed <a href=".html">Br Peter Jacob Planta</a>, who <br />entered into the joy of his Lord, at <a href="#mlpla000063.html"
        >Ockbrook</a>, <br /><em>May the 6<sup>th</sup> 1815</em>, in the 94<sup>th</sup> year of <br /> his age, written by himself.</p>
    <p>I was born at <a href="#mlpla000085.html">Jonkioping a town in <br /> Sweden</a>, <em>Dec<sup>r</sup> the 5<sup>th</sup>, old stile in the <br /> year 1721</em>. My Father's name was <a
        href="#mlper000535.html">Jacob <br /> Planta</a> &amp; my Mother's maiden name <br /><a href=".html">Martha Ruda</a>. They were both of the <br />Lutheran Religion. I had two sisters, <br />
      the elder was born during my Mother's <br /> marriage to her first husband, whose <br /> name was <a href=".html">Peter Hilling</a>. Our Parents <br /> spared no pains in giving us a religious
      <br /> &amp; genteel education; we had morning <br /> &amp; evening prayers in the family, to <br /> which the servants were also admitted.</p>
    <p> My dear Mother would often read in <br /> the bible, &amp; after prayers, used to re- <br /> late to us pleasing scriptural his <br /> tories, especially such as had a reference <br /> to the
      life, sufferings &amp; death of our <br /> dear Lord &amp; Saviour, &amp; also his conversations </p>PAGE BREAK <p> with his disciples &amp; some of the persecut- <br /> tions which the latter
      had to endure for <br /> his sake. On such occasions I used to <br /> sit on her lap, &amp; sometimes asked what <br /> reward the disciples had for their faithful- <br /> ness to our Saviour:
      to which she replied: <br /> "They are richly rewarded for they are now <br />exceeding happy with Him in his heavenly <br /> kingdom, singing his praises, &amp; adoring<br /> him for ever! I
      said with tears, O my <br /> dear Mamma, I wish that I had lived at <br /> the time our Saviour was upon earth, <br /> I also would have served him &amp; suffered<br /> for his sake. My Mother
      replied weeping, <br /> my dear child, if you had lived at that <br /> time you might perhaps have been of <br /> the number of those who cried out, cru- <br /> cify him! crucify him! I said, O
      no, I never <br /> would, but I should have loved him dearly. </p>
    <p> She then blessed me, &amp; prayed the Lord to <br /> keep me as his property, &amp; to preserve <br /> me throughout my future life from sin, <br /> &amp; the seductions of this evil world,
      until <br /> I should be with him in his heavenly <br /> kingdom, &amp; then added that all those who <br />loved &amp; served him here, would share <br /> in the same blessings which his
      disciples <br /> did. - This made a deep impression on my <br /> mind, &amp; was the first time when I </p>PAGE BREAK <p> but to have felt a real &amp; tender love &amp; <br />attachment in my
      heart to our dear Saviour, <br /> &amp; in the sequel I always wished &amp; prayed that I <br /> might become &amp; remain a true child of <br /><a href=".html">God</a>. When I was about <em>4
        years of age</em>, <br /> I experienced a remarkable preservation <br /> of my life. Having ran out of the house <br /> unobserved, with a spoon in my hand, I <br /> came to <a
        href="#mlpla000177.html">Lake Wetter</a>, which was not <br /> far distant from our house, &amp; there <br /> being a broad plank laid over the water, <br /> I got to the end of it, &amp; was
      sitting on <br /> it, playing with the water, &amp; throwing <br /> it up with the spoon, admiring the <br /> drops which appeared to me like pearls. </p>
    <p> A woman who came to fetch water, called <br /> out to me to take care that I did not fall <br /> into the water, to whom I replied: I will <br /> not fall in, but she had scarcely returned
      <br /> to her house before she thought that she <br /> heard a plunge in the water, upon <br /> which she set down her pail, &amp; ran <br /> towards the lake. Perceiving me in <br /> the water,
      she ventured in, &amp; with difficulty <br /> caught hold of me by the hair of my <br /> head, &amp; drawing me out, she laid me <br /> across the plank, believing me to be <br /> dead. She then
      carried me home to my <br /> Parents, who, with the whole family were </p>PAGE BREAK <p>greatly alarmed, &amp; exceeding distressed, as they <br /> could perceived no signs of life in me. I
      <br /> was however put into a warm bed, &amp; after <br /> some time, while they were lamenting over <br /> me, I came to myself &amp; said dear Mamma <br /> don't cry for me, I am here, &amp;
      to the great <br /> joy of the whole family I recovered. As <br /> I increased in years, I experienced several <br /> preservations of my life, having been <br /> in danger of losing it, both by
      fire &amp; water <br /> &amp; once escaped being murdered. My Parents <br /> being desirous to give me a good education, <br /> procured a private Tutor in the house, <br /> until I went to a
      large school, in which <br /> I continued till my Father's happy depar- <br /> ture, which took place <em>in my 10<sup>th</sup> year</em>.</p>
    <p> My Mother's intention was that I should <br /> continue my studies, wishing me to be <br /> a Ministter of the Gospel, which also accord- <br /> ed with my inclination. However a <br />
      Relation persuaded my Mother to put <br /> me apprentice to an eminent Surgeon<br /> &amp; Apothecary in <a href="#mlpla000086.html">Gothenburg</a>. Here I had <br /> a favorable opportunity to
      learn Pharmacy <br /> &amp; Chemistry, &amp; as my master had very <br /> extensive practice, &amp; employed me to <br /> visit his patients, I gradually began <br /> to practice myself. &amp;
      gave considerable <br />satisfaction to my employer.</p>
    <p> Having been awakened to a sense of </p>PAGE BREAK <p> my lost condition, I was for several years <br />much concerned for my salvation, yea I may <br /> say ever since I was a child, the Holy
      Ghost<br /> carried on his work in my heart, by which <br /> I was prevented from many sinful things, altho' <br /> I did frequently fall into sin, repenting &amp; sinning <br /> alternately, so
      that when I would do good, evil <br /> was present with me. I felt frequently a <br />great desire to separate myself from the <br /> world, &amp; used to walk in the fields, where I <br />
      could be alone, praying to our dear Saviour, <br /> in which I took great delight. At such <br /> times I felt much pleasure in singing, <br />praises &amp; thanksgiving <a href=".html">God</a>;
      &amp; nothing <br /> afforded me greater joy, than to thank our <br />Saviour for the many preservations I had <br /> experienced from him, when in danger of <br /> my life. However I also,
      alas! often forgot <br /> myself, &amp; gave way to levity when play- <br /> ing with my companions. But the good <br /> spirit of <a href=".html">God</a> frequently reminded me <br /> to seek
      the One thing needful. I felt a <br />strong desire to be a child of <a href=".html">God</a>, &amp; <br /> when I was invited with my Parents <br /> to entertainments, at which was music <br />
      &amp; dancing, I felt afterwards, great un- <br /> easiness, &amp;, like one who is sick, not <br /> understanding properly the accusations <br /> of my conscience. <em>When I was about 13
        <br /> years of age</em> I had a great desire to <br />enjoy the Holy Comn, for which purpose </p>PAGE BREAK <p> I underwent an examination, &amp; was encouraged <br /> to partake. The first
      time I had the favor to <br /> approach the table of the Lord, it was with <br />fear &amp; trembling, lest I should receive it <br /> unworthily, but at the enjoyment of this divine <br />
      repast, I felt exceedingly happy, yea more <br /> so than I can express. In the sequel, whilst <br /> the Holy Ghost was operating upon my heart, <br /> I frequently examined myself, fearing I
      was <br /> not yet a child of <a href=".html">God</a>, &amp; yet earnestly <br /> desiring to be one. Such was the state of <br /> my mind when I came to <a href="#mlpla000086.html"
        >Gothenburg</a>. I <br /> experienced, at first much attention from the <br /> family in which I resided as an Apprentice, so <br /> long as I conformed to every thing in it. How <br /> ever
      the great concern I had for my salvation <br /> &amp; the thought of not being a child of <a href=".html">God</a>, gave <br /> me much uneasiness. I was always glad<br /> whenever I could be
      alone, &amp; pour out the desire <br /> of my heart before <a href=".html">God</a>, &amp; frequently prayed <br /> in stillness to him. I also resolved to with <br /> draw from all worldly
      amusements &amp; to <br /> spend the little time I had to myself, in <br /> spiritual exercises, longing to be assured that <br /> I was a child of <a href=".html">God</a>. Sometimes I <br />
      arose in cold frosty nights, prostrating <br /> myself before <a href=".html">God</a>, &amp; praying most fer- <br /> vently unto him, but it afforded me <br /> no relief. I thought then that my
      <br />sorrow for my sins was not yet great </p>PAGE BREAK <p> enough &amp; often repeated the 10 Command- <br /> ments, in order to see &amp; feel my deviations <br /> &amp; sins, but as I could
      not cry &amp; weep like <br /><a href=".html">David</a>, who all the night made his bed to <br /> swim, &amp; watered his couch with his tears, <br /> I thought my grief was not intense
      enough.</p>
    <p> But all my endeavours were in vain, because <br /> I erred, in supposing that if I could but weep <br /> much over my sins &amp; repent of them, then <br /> the Lord would receive me as his
      child, &amp; com- <br /> fort me. I was convinced of the all sufficiency <br /> of our Lord &amp; Saviour, suffering for sinners, <br /> but thought I must be thus qualified before <br /> I
      could receive this blessing. I became now <br />very zealous, frequently reproving others for sin, <br /> &amp; my singular conduct brought on me much <br /> persecution &amp; hatred, which
      however I <br />gladly suffered, bearing all with patience <br /> &amp; never resenting any ill treatment, but <br /> on the contrary did such persons all the <br /> service I could, &amp;
      whenever opportunities <br /> offered, spoke to them concerning our Saviour.</p>
    <p> Two persons in the family where I lodged <br /> being awakened to a sense of their lost <br /> condition, one of them caused me much<br />trouble &amp; uneasiness, on account of his
      <br />fears &amp; unbelief, thinking he could not be <br />forgiven. He fell at last into a <br />melancholy, frequently hiding himself, </p>PAGE BREAK <p> &amp; even attempted to take away his
      life so that <br /> he appeared in a state of mental derangement.</p>
    <p> I used my utmost endeavours to nurture him, <br />fearing that in case he should commit suicide <br /> a great dishonor would be brought on the gospel. <br /> One time he sent me a message
        <sup>with</sup><del>of</del> his last fare- <br /> well, having locked himself up with a view to <br /> self-destruction. This caused me unspeak- <br /> able distress, &amp; tho' I was at that
      time en- <br /> gaged in very urgent business, &amp; in company <br /> with several persons, yet I took the key of <br /> the cellar, ran down &amp; locked the door, &amp; <br /> kneeling down
      by a hogshead of turpentine, I wept<br /> &amp; prayed most fervently to our Saviour, (with <br />great confidence), that he would preserve the poor <br /> man's life, &amp; it seemed to me as
      if I heard <br /> a voice saying - Be comforted, no evil shall <br /> hurt him. This I believed, &amp; arose, giving <br />thanks to <a href=".html">God</a> my Saviour, &amp; returned cheerful
      <br /> ly to my business, till about 12 o'clock at night, <br /> being uneasy<del>ness</del> in my mind, I removed some <br /> boards &amp; other things, when I found him alive <br /> &amp;
      feeling thankful to <a href=".html">God</a> for his preservation, <br /> I asked him why he had not performed <sup>executed</sup> his <br /> intention, to which he replied, that when he <br />
      was about to attempt it, he fell, &amp; all his <br /> strength was taken from him, so that he <br /> could neither move a limb, nor speak <br /> a word, till I came. I spoke comfortably<br />
      to him, encouraging him to take his <br /> refuge to our Saviour &amp; conducting him <br /> to his room, I prayed with him, &amp; in the <br /> sequel he grew better. The other person </p>PAGE
    BREAK <p> who was awakened was the Cook, who <br /> died suddenly, but very happily. She had <br /> been much beloved by her Mistress, &amp; <br /> her Mistress' Mother, &amp; her sudden death
      <br /> caused the old Lady to swoon away. I was <br /> then, (altho I had been much despised &amp; <br /> derided on account of religion,) called upon <br /> to speak comfort to the old lady,
      &amp; as soon <br /> as she recovered, she took me by the hand <br /> &amp; begged my pardon, adding: "I have been <br /> the cause of the persecution you have suffered."</p>
    <p> I replied, 'I have no occasion to forgive you, <br /> for you have done me more good than harm, since <br /> it has caused me to cleave closer to my Sa- <br /> viour, who will hear the prayers
      of all repent- <br /> ing sinners. Thus her hatred &amp; persecution were <br /> turned into great love &amp; kindness. About <br /> this time I attended the preaching of the <br /><a
        href=".html">Rev<sup>d</sup> M<sup>r</sup> Lindberg</a> in <a href="#mlpla000086.html">Gothenburg</a>. He observed <br /> in his sermon, that there were several kinds <br /> of people, who
      were hindered from enjoying<br /> the happiness which the Lord would willingly <br /> bestow upon them, if they would but come in <br /> the way &amp; order of his appointment. Among <br /> one
      of these sorts of well meaning souls, I <br /> found myself so completely described as if I <br /> had opened my whole mind to him. He <br /> remarked that some people thought that if <br />
      they could arrive at a certain degree of ex- <br /> cessive grief &amp; anguish, &amp; could shed repenting <br /> tears night &amp; day, that then the Lord</p>PAGE BREAK <p> would have mercy
      upon them, forgive them <br /> all their sins, &amp; be gracious unto them. But, <br /> said he, this is worth nothing, for nothing is <br /> meritorious on our part. Nothing but alone <br />
      the meritorious holy life, bitter sufferings, bleeding <br /> &amp; dying of our Lord &amp; Saviour<a href=".html">Jesus Christ</a>, <br /> his being wounded for our transgressions, &amp; his
      <br />sorrows &amp; anguish until death, this alone <br /> meritorious, &amp; whoever can believe this, <br /> will obtain mercy &amp; forgiveness of all his sins.</p>
    <p> He added - My dear Friend, whoever thou art <br /> &amp; wherever thou art standing or seated in this <br /> place - Come with me, &amp; let us mount up <br /> by faith to <a href=".html"
        >Mount Calvary</a>, &amp; behold the <br /> Cross of Christ, the sufferingLamb of <a href=".html">God</a>, <br /> view his wounds, his thorny crown, &amp; all his <br />torments by faith. It
      was then, that with <br /> a happyastonishment I truly beheld, as <br /> for me, my Saviour bowing his head, <br /> &amp; giving up his spirit into the hands of <br /> his dear heavenly Father,
      &amp; in that mo- <br /> ment all my uneasiness &amp; heaviness, <br /> which had tormented my conscience <br /> forsook me, &amp; I was filled with such <br />joy &amp; happiness, as not to be
      able to <br /> describe it, &amp; I heard no more what <br /> the Preacher said, but rejoiced in stillness, <br />thanking my dear Saviour, being fully <br /> assured that he had forgiven me all
    </p>PAGE BREAK <p> my sins. I returned home filled with <br />Gratitude &amp; entering my chamber, I <br /> locked the door, fell prostrate before him, <br /> &amp; offered him the sacrifice of
      thanksgiving.</p>
    <p> I felt as new born, but this lasted only a <br /> day &amp; a half, when a person treated me ill, <br /> Which caused anger to arise <sup>with</sup>in my breast, <br /> altho’ I did not reply
      one word, yet it caused <br /> me to lose this impression of happiness, &amp; <br /> plunged me into distress, so that I could <br /> not rest, fearing I had lost the grace<br /> bestowed upon
      me, &amp; should be lost. I called <br /> upon a Minister, to whom I opened my mind, <br /> &amp; informed him of my situation &amp; grief. He <br />comforted me with these words: “My dear
      friend, <br /> the <a href=".html">Apostle Peter</a> once asked the <a href=".html">Lord Jesus</a>, <br /> how often he should forgive his brother? Till <br /> seven times?” To which our Lord
      replied: <br /> I say not unto thee until 7 times, but <br /> until 70 times 7. Now if our good Lord, <br /> commanded a sinful man to forgive his <br /> brother so often, what must not he
      himself <br /> do, when a poor sinner repents, &amp; prays <br /> to him for forgiveness, since he is the foun- <br /> tain of all goodness, grace &amp; mercy!” I asked <br /> him if I might
      pray to our Saviour to <br />forgive me? to which he replied: <br /> certainly, for as often as we fall we <br /> must rise &amp; go to our merciful<br />Saviour, who will in no wise cast out
      <br /> those who come to him. I asked <del>if I</del></p>PAGE BREAK <p> &amp; may I go to him whenever I want com- <br /> fort? to which he answered, By all <br /> means. This proved a great
      comfort to <br /> me &amp; it caused me to feel quite happy, <br /> because our Lord would be so gracious<br /> I followed his advice &amp; found comfort. Feeling <br /> myself one time
      exceeding unworthy, so that <br /> I durst not venture to go to the Holy Com<sup>n</sup><br /> I called upon a pious Clergyman to whom <br /> I opened my whole mind. He comforted me <br /> by
      saying: My dear Friend, even such as you <br /> are, the Lord<a href=".html">Jesus</a> calls to come, for he <br /> says: "Come until me all ye that labor &amp; <br /> are heavy laden &amp; I
      will give you rest; <br /> take my yoke upon you &amp; learn of me <br /> for I am meek &amp; lowly in heart, &amp; ye <br /> shall find rest unto your souls. He <br /> admonished me not to
      absent myself, <br /> adding that he intended the following Sunday <br /> to partake of the H. Com<sup>n</sup>  himself &amp; <br /> that if I would attend, the Lord would <br /> certainly bless
      &amp; comfort me. Hereupon <br /> I ventured with trembling, &amp; during the <br /> participation experienced inexpressible joy<br /> &amp; comfort. During the time when I ex- <br /> perienced
        <sup>endured</sup> much persecution, I felt a <br />great desire to become acquainted with <br /> a genuine child of <a href=".html">God</a>, if there were <br /> any in this world, &amp;
      often prayed that <br /> the Lord would bring it about. And <br /> was once walking in a private place </p>PAGE BREAK <p> and weeping, I perceived a hill on the top of <br /> which was a cavity,
      which when I perceived, I <br />rejoiced, thinking this a suitable place, in which <br /> I could pour out my whole soul before the Lord, <br /> unobserved as I thought by any one. I em- <br />
      braced this opportunity with gratitude, &amp; <br /> kneeling down, prayed with fervor to our Saviour, <br /> mentioning to him all my concerns, intreating <br /> him with great earnestness, if
      there was any <br /> genuine child of <a href=".html">God</a> in the world, he would <br /> bring him to me, or me to him, in order <br /> that we might become acquainted, during <br /> which
      prayer I felt richly comforted with <br /> his divine presence. Whilst I was at prayer, <br /> it happened that 2 persons belonging to the <br />B<sup>rn's</sup> Cong<sup>n</sup> came that way,
      &amp; when they <br /> arrived near the summit of the hill, they <br /> heard the sound of a voice, &amp; the one observed <br /> to the other, that there was a poor sinner <br /> praying to our
      Saviour. Let us (said they,) <br /> not disturb him. One of them however, <br /> came softly &amp; unperceived by me, to the <br /> summit, &amp; knew me, as I was in a public <br /> line of
      business. I did not, at that time, <br /> know that there was such a people as the <br />United Brn, nor even that there were any <br /> awakened in <a href="#mlpla000086.html">Gottenburg</a>
      who were so near to <br /> me. The above 2 B<sup>rn</sup> persons acquainted the <br />B<sup>rn</sup> on their return, what they had observed.</p>
    <p> Some days after, a certain B<sup>n</sup>, who was a <br /> gentleman's gardener, &amp; who was in the habit <br /> of coming to our house, &amp; supplying us with </p>PAGE BREAK <p> medicinal
      herbs, began to notice me in a <br /> manner he had never done before, &amp; at last <br /> invited me to pay him a visit. I thanked<br /> him, but excused myself with observing that <br /> I
      had no time to spare, &amp; if I had any I <br /> knew how to make a better use of it; for <br /> I found to be enticed to enter into worldly <br /> amusements. However he came in the sequel
      <br /> to visit me occasionally, &amp; one Sunday called <br /> a little before service time, on purpose <br /> that he might be with me alone. When <br /> all were gone to <a href=".html"
        >Church</a>, he said to me, <br /> My Friend, I believe you to be a person <br /> who loves our Saviour, &amp; I am another, <br /> would it not be well if we were better <br /> acquainted? I
      was struck with astonish- <br /> ment, &amp; explained: What! are you a child <br /> of <a href=".html">God</a>? he answered with a friendly mien, <br /> Yes. I said: then the Lord has heard my
      <br /> prayers. I rejoiced exceedingly, fell about <br /> his neck &amp; wept for joy. He said: <br /> Will you, my Friend, come &amp; see me now. <br /> I replied yes, that I will with all my
      <br /> heart, &amp; <a href=".html">God</a> willing this day. He then <br /> gave me a ticket that I might not <br /> be hindered by the Porter when entering <br /> his Garden. After divine
      service (having <br /> requested leave,) I set off, &amp; walking there a <br /> large ground, on a broad foot path, I per- <br /> ceived a Gentleman's carriage, stopping </p>PAGE BREAK <p> in
      the high road, &amp; the Gentleman &amp; <br /> his servant getting out. They got over the <br /> fence &amp; ran towards me. Altho, I might <br /> have easily ran away I stopped, thinking that
      <br /> I was not on the <sup>right</sup> road, altho' it appeared to me <br /> like a public path. When the Gentleman <br /> came up to me, he immediately pulled off <br /> my cloak, &amp; gave
      it in anger to his servant, <br /> adding who gave you leave to walk here? <br /> I replied humbly that I had not known I <br /> was trespassing, &amp; begged pardon, while at <br /> the same
      time I unbuttoned my coat, with <br /> a view to give him that also, calling to <br /> mind our Saviour's words: Him that <br /> taketh away thy cloak, forbid not to take <br /> thy coat also;
      upon which his anger sub- <br /> sided. I then asked permission to return, <br /> but he said, As you have come so far you <br /> may proceed. He refused however to take <br /> my coat, but kept
      my cloak, upon which <br /> we parted. When I arrived at the garden <br /> &amp; had shown my ticket, I was admitted <br /> &amp; going up to the house, I knocked at the <br /> door but when it
      was opened, I saw many <br /> persons in the house; &amp; thinking they <br /> were worldly-minded people I shut the <br /> door in haste, &amp; returned into the garden <br />weeping. My friend
      followed me, &amp; <br /> asked the cause of my weeping? I re- <br /> plied that I was exceedingly sorry that <br /> I was deceived, for if he were a child of <br /><a href=".html">God</a>, he
      would not have such a number </p>PAGE BREAK <p> of people with him: He answered: But <br /> what will you say, when I inform you <br /> that all these persons are children of <br /><a
        href=".html">God</a>, Come &amp; see. I said, that I could <br /> not have believed there were so many <br /> children of <a href=".html">God</a> in the whole world.</p>
    <p> Having entered the house &amp; standing at <br /> the door, I asked with surprise, if all <br /> present were children of <a href=".html">God</a>, which <br /> was answered in a friendly
      manner in <br /> the affirmative. I said with tears of joy, <br /> then I am not worthy to be among you. <br /> However they asked me to sit down &amp; they <br /> would communicate some written
      accounts <br /> from the B<sup>rns</sup>  Cong<sup>n</sup>. I said, is there <br /> indeed a Cong<sup>n</sup> of B<sup>rn </sup> existing in our <br /> times, like the Cong<sup>ns</sup> in the
      times of the <br /> Apostles? They replied: yes I said: <br /> Then I wish to live in such an one, <br /> to which they answered, if it was the <br /> will of our Saviour that I should, he would
      <br /> bring it to pass. In this manner I got <br /> acquainted with the B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; after this <br /> interview longed to attain my wish, <br /> but could not accomplish it for several
      <br /> years. </p>
    <p> A considerable time after my appren- <br /> ticeship was expired, it happend that <br /><a href="#mlper000367.html">Frederic the 1<sup>st</sup> King of <a

        href="#mlpla000360.html">Stock- <br /> holm</a>, where all the medicines for the <br />King &amp; Royal Family were prepared, as <br /> also for many of the Nobility. This <br /> change
      pleased me much, particularly <br /> as many B<sup>rn</sup> were in Stockholm, &amp; <br /> set off, altho' my employer was sorry<br /> to part with me. On the journey <br /> I got acquainted
      with the King's chap- <br /> lain, who very kindly invited me to tra- <br /> vel in his Carriage, &amp; desired his Serv<sup>t</sup><br /> to travel in my small carriage, &amp; thus <br /> we
      arrived safe &amp; well in <a href="#mlpla000360.html">Stockholm</a>.</p>
    <p> In this city, I frequently visited the pa- <br /> tients of <a href=".html">D<sup>r</sup> Vigand</a>, who treated me <br /> very kindly, &amp; had also an opportu- <br /> nity of visiting the
        B<sup>rn</sup>. Altho I <br /> had it very agreeable, yet I longed<br /> much to live in a Cong<sup>n</sup>  of the B<sup>rn </sup><br /> in <a href="#mlpla000139.html">Germany</a>, but by the
      advice of the <br />B<sup>rn</sup> in <a href="#mlpla000360.html">Stockholm</a>, I continued there <br /> in my employment several years, <br /> until my desire grew so strong that <br />I set
      off in the year <em>1747</em> from <a href="#mlpla000360.html">Stockholm</a>, <br /> &amp; arrived <em>July 15<sup>th</sup> the same year</em><br /> in <a href="#mlpla000014.html">Herrnhaag</a>.
      The daily word of <br /> that day was, <a href=".html">God</a> is with thee in </p>PAGE BREAK <p> all that thou dost. Gen: 21. 22. At <br /> first objections to my continuance in <br /> this
      place were made on account of <br /> there being no prospect of employing me.</p>
    <p> However I began a manufactory of <br /> Chocolate which answered so well that <br /> I not only had employment myself, but <br /> could employ others also. Having in the <br /> sequel obtained
      permission to be an <br /> inhabitant of the place, I was rec<sup>d</sup><br /> the <em>same year on Dec. 31</em> with 49 B<sup>rn</sup><br />  in<del>to</del><sup>a</sup>solemn manner a member

    <p><em>March 25. 1748</em>, I had the favor to <br /> partake for the 1<sup>st</sup> time with the same <br /> of the body &amp; blood of our dear Lord in <br /> the holy sacrament, which proved a
      great <br /> refreshment &amp; blessing to my hand. <em>In <br /> 1750</em>, I went by commission, to care for <br /> the sick at <a href="#mlpla000361.html">Lindheim</a>, &amp; the following
      <br /> year accompanied <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Lykefet</a>, who <br /> was sick, on a journey to <a href="#mlpla000022.html">Barby</a>. The <br /> night previous to our arrival at <a
        href="#mlpla000362.html">Eisen- <br /> ach</a>, we had both the same dream, <br /> viz: that he fell out of the carriage, <br /> but our dreams differed in this, that <br /> he dreamt that he
      was killed, &amp; <br /> I dreamt that he fell into my arms.</p>
    <p> This dream was repeated 3 times, at <br /> which we grew alarmed, apprehending </p>PAGE BREAK <p> some danger awaited us. We arose <br /> from bed, &amp; recommended ourselves to the <br />
      protection of our mercifulSaviour, &amp; <br /> were greatly comforted, feeling his divine <br /> presence with us, &amp; then went to bed <br /> again. Early in the morning, we pro- <br />
      ceeded on our journey, &amp; it being cold, <br /> I got out of the carriage to walk, in <br /> order to get warm, &amp; not recollecting <br /> our dreams, I attempted to get into <br /> it
      again, when the wheel went over <br /> a stone, <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Lykefet</a> fell out, &amp; I <br /> caught him in my arms, by which I <br /> was thrown down with him, &amp; which
      <br /> probably prevented the wheel going over <br /> him, &amp; neither of us received any hurt, <br /> for which we were very thankful to <br /> our dear Lord, &amp; arrived safe at

      great use &amp; blessing to me. <br /><em>April 10<sup>th</sup> 1755</em>, I married my late dear <br /> wife, whose maiden name was <a href=".html">Lier</a>.</p>

    <p> Having rec<sup>d</sup> &amp; accepted a call to serve <br /> the mission in <a href="#mlpla000076.html">Jamaica</a>, as also the <br /> late <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> John Brown</a>, we

      &amp; set sail in the <br /> morning, but were obliged to cast an- <br /> chor in the evening. The day proving <br /> very stormy, caused us, &amp; several other <br /> Passengers to be sick,
      &amp; we were obliged <br /> to be at anchor a fortnight, but spent <br /> our time, while <del>at</del> in the Downs, in a <br />blessed manner, reading the harmony of the 4 <br /> Gospels,
      &amp; enjoying the presence of the Lord, <br /> whilst singing in fellowship his praise. <em>The 20<sup>th</sup></em> early in the morning, a signal was made <br /> for the fleet to get under
      weigh. We <br /> were about 250 vessels in Co, besides <br /> small craft, &amp; about noon we passed by <br /><a href="#mlpla000364.html">Dover</a> with a favorable wind, &amp; <em>the

        >London</a>. <em>The 23<sup>d</sup> early</em>, our ship's crew <br /> attempted to seize a boat, &amp; leave the <br /> vessel, the mate having offended them, &amp; <br /> alledging they were
      too few in number to <br /> navigate the vessel, however the Captain <br /> restored order, &amp; procured several addition <br /> al hands on board; about 11p.m. we pro- <br /> ceeded with a
      favorable breeze, but the <br /><em>following day</em>, the weather becoming boister- <br /> ous, we grew very sick. During the <br /> night, 2 ships ran foul of each other, <br /> &amp; one of
      them received considerable damage, <br /> &amp; was obliged to put back. <em>The 25<sup>th</sup><br /></em>we were becalmed, but <em>the following day</em><br /> the wind rose very high, however
      I recovered <br /> so far that I could keep out of bed, for <br /> which I was very thankful. The <em>30<sup>th</sup><br /></em>we were driven to the Irish coast; &amp; <br /> entered the <a
        href="#mlpla000365.html">harbor of Kinsale</a>, where <br /> we went on shore, &amp; as our Captain <br /> apprehended we should have a tedious<br /> passage, he advised us to lay in more
      <br /> provisions. My wife &amp; I therefore went to <br /> a shop to purchase what was needful.</p>
    <p> The Master &amp; Mistress who were elderly <br /> people, inquired if we had come with <br /> the fleet from <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, to which we <br /> replied that we had.
      They Said : May <br /><a href=".html">God</a> forbid! I asked why? They added, <br /> we appeared very unsuitable for <a href="#mlpla000076.html">Jamai- <br /> ca</a>, since none but such whose
      character <br /> was bad went to that Island, &amp; they </p>PAGE BREAK <p> would advise us to relinquish the <br /> voyage, &amp; as I was in the medical <br /> line, they wished we would
      reside with <br /> them, &amp; they would lodge &amp; board us, &amp; <br /> as they had many friends in the Town who <br /> would be glad to employ me, I should soon <br /> have plenty of
      practice, or if we pre- <br /> ferred returning to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, they would <br /> send us free of expense thither in one of <br /> of their own vessels, which would
      sail in <br /> a few days Thanking them for their <br /> kindness to strangers, as we were to <br /> them, we replied that it was our in- <br /> tention to proceed. They asked, what could <br />
      induce us to proceed in such a step? I <br /> added, that altho' I might probably <br /> practice physic &amp; surgery in that <br /> Island, yet my chief design was, to preach <br /> the gospel
      to the Negro slaves &amp; endeavour to be <br /> instrumental in turning them from darkness to <br /> light, &amp; from the power of <a href=".html">Satan</a> unto <a href=".html">God</a><br />
      their Saviour. They replied Then go in <br /> the name of <a href=".html">God</a>, for this is a good work, &amp; <br /> we should be sorry to hinder it.</p>
    <p><em>April 18</em>, we got sight of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jamaica.html">Jamaica</a>, <br /> having been 5 months on board, &amp; were <br />truly glad, when on the
          <em>19<sup>th</sup></em> about noon, we <br /> cast anchor in the harbor of <a href="#mlpla000367.html">Port Royal</a>, we <br /> hired a boat, &amp; proceeded to <a href="#mlpla000076.html"
        >Kingston</a>, &amp; <br /> landed about 3 miles from <a href="#mlpla000032.html">Carmel</a>. <a href="#mlpla000076.html">Colonel<br /> Brook</a> &amp; his Lady met us, &amp; bid us welcome,
      <br /> inviting us to dine at their house, &amp; sent <br /> us in their carriage to <a href="#mlpla000032.html">Carmel</a>, where we </p>PAGE BREAK <p> met with a truly cordial reception from
      <br /> our B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; S<sup>rs</sup>, &amp; who with us rejoiced<br /> at our arrival, &amp; thanked our merciful<br />Lord for his preservation on our voyage.</p>
    <p> In this Island our late Brother served <br /> both in his medicinal capacity, &amp; in the <br /> Mission, as a devoted servant of the Lord, <br /> spending his time &amp; talents for that
      Saviour, <br /> whom he truly loved, &amp; in whom he had found <br /> pardon, peace &amp; eternal life. In those <br /> Diaries which he kept during his abode <br /> in that Island, it appears
      that he was <br />earnestly solicitous to promote the happiness<br /> of those souls committed to his care, &amp; that <br /> during his services there, he endured not <br /> only many
      hardships, but also escaped <br /> many dangers, but it was apparent that <br /> none of these things moved him, neither <br /> counted he his life dear unto himself, <br /> so that he might
      finish his course <br /> with joy, &amp; the ministry which he had <br /> received of the Lord<a href=".html">Jesus Christ</a>, to testi- <br /> fy the gospel of the grace of <a href=".html"
        >God</a>. A few <br /> extracts out of his diaries will suffice <br /> to show his state of heart &amp; mind. He <br /> writes thus: “By degrees I got also my <br /> choice of sufferings, but
      which, in due <br /> times my Saviour terminated, &amp; which <br /> he enabled me to bear with patience.</p>
    <p> They had a salutory effect upon my soul <br /> It was a delight to me to serve my <br /> dearest Saviour, which I did in preaching </p>PAGE BREAK <p> his Gospel in various places in <a
        href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jamaica.html">Jamaica</a><br /> both to so called Christians &amp; Heathens. <br /> I feel truly thankful to my Saviour, who <br /> always comforted me where
      I met with <br />afflictions, &amp; strengthened &amp; upheld me, <br /> when fatigued in body &amp; in mind. For <br /> I had to ride out both in the day &amp; <br /> night time, in attending
      the sick, <br /> which wearied me often to such a degree, <br /> that I was ready to faint. My gracious<br />Lord, however supported me at such <br /> times, &amp; in such a manner, that I
      <br /> cannot recollect even once to have refined <br /> at my situation.</p>
    <p> In the time of Rebellion among the <br /> Negroes, when many white people lost <br /> their lives, I never took any weapons of <br /> defence with me when I rode out, altho <br /> advised by
      many to do so, &amp; yet I always <br /> escaped unhurt to my own astonishment, <br /> I generally replied to such advice, I trust<br /> in the Lord my <a href=".html">God</a> who can preserve
      <br /> me in all danger, &amp; this confidence he <br /> never put to shame, blessed be his holy <br /> name.</p>
    <p> I will have relate, many divers instances, <br /> several proofs of the gracious, care &amp; preserva- <br /> tion, which I have experienced, &amp; record <br /> them to the praise &amp; glory
      of my deliverer <br /> &amp; Saviour.</p>
    <p> Travelling once in an extensive, woody, <br /> &amp; mountainous place, with a view to </p>PAGE BREAK <p> visit the sick on an estate called <a href=".html">One <br /> Eye Estate</a> &amp;
      feeling very happy. I rode slowly, <br /> singing some edifying hymns. My servant <br /> rode up to me saying, Master is truly <br /> happy, to which I replied, I am; but I <br /> was not aware
      of the great danger to <br /> which I was exposed, as several runaway <br /> slaves, who had turned robbers, were <br /> just before us, in pursuit of an Officer, <br /> whom they intended to
      murder &amp; rob, &amp; <br /> who arrived a little before us me at this <br /> Estate, quite exhausted with fear &amp; weariness.</p>
    <p> A number of soldiers who were just exercising <br /> asked me at my arrival, how I had <br /> escaped the Robbers? &amp; when I informed <br /> them that I had seen none, they could <br />
      scarcely believe me, declaring they had seen <br /> them enter the wood from when I came.</p>
    <p> Another time I arrived at an old building <br /> which had been uninhabited for many <br /> years, &amp; which was situated upon an <br /> high hill, in which I took shelter <br /> from the
      rain. A number of robbers <br /> had just left this building, &amp; the last <br /> man out when I entered it, being a- <br /> larmed on seeing others coming up the <br /> hill who had been
      taken prisoners.</p>
    <p> I thanked the Lord for this gracious<br /> interposition, &amp; when I arrived at <a href=".html"><a href=".html">Colonel<br /> Armstrong</a>'s house</a>, I found him &amp; his <br /> family
      standing in the Piazza looking <br /> out for me in great anxiety, fearing</p>PAGE BREAK <p> I might have fallen into the hands of <br /> the Robbers. They all rejoiced at my <br /> escape, as
      the rebellious Negroes had <br /> committed much mischief in that neigh- <br /> borhood, the preceeding night. The Co- <br /> lonelwished to prevail upon me to stay <br /> with him all night,
      but I declined his <br /> kind offer, &amp; returned to my abode at <br /><a href=".html">Edens</a> in the evening, without receiving <br /> any molestation, &amp; was glad to find <br /> that
      my wife had received no injury, altho' <br /> the Rebels had passed by my house during <br /> my absence. Some of them had been that <br /> night in our Plantation, but altho our <br /> house
      was situated on a lonely eminence, <br /> about the distance of a mile from any other <br /> habitation, yet our graciousLord preserved <br /> us; &amp; I could visit my patients, without <br />
      ever being hurt."</p>

      wife proceeded to <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, <br /> to visit their children, who were in the school <br /> for Education. They arrived in the month of <br /><em>October</em> in <a
        href="#mlpla000063.html">Oakbrook</a>, where our late Brother<br /> assisted in preaching the gospel, &amp; entered <br /> upon his medicinal profession. He was <br /> universally beloved
      &amp; respected, both within </p>PAGE BREAK <p> &amp; without the circle of the B<sup>rn's</sup> Congns.<br /> His genuine humility, fervor of love<br /> to his Saviour, unshaken reliance upon
      <br /> his all sufficient sacrifice, &amp; his <br /> cordiality &amp; amiable deportment, were <br /> truly edifying: &amp; it was only necessary <br /> to know him to love &amp; esteem
      him.</p>
    <p>His late Wife departed into a happy eter- <br /> nity in <a href="#mlpla000063.html">Ockbrook</a> on <em>Decr the 17<sup>th</sup> 1793</em>. His <br /> daughter <a href=".html">Benigna</a> came
      from <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, to <br /> keep his home, &amp; care for her aged Parent, <br /> &amp; which she did with much faithfulness: <br /> when however, her state of health
      was <br /> such that she could no longer attend upon <br /> her dear Father as formerly, &amp; she in- <br /> formed him of it, He folded his hands &amp; <br /> explained Then my dear Lord take
      me <br /> first. It was on <em>Thursday May the <br /> 4<sup>th</sup></em> when he was as well as usual, that <br /> his daughter, feeling her extreme weakness, <br /> had for the first time
      made him fully <br /> sensible that her ability &amp; not her love<br /> failed; he then uttered that fervent<br /> request to be first taken, &amp; he was that <br /> very evening struck for
      death whilst <br /> his daughter was absent at the Sister's <br /> Festival to which she had been <br /> carried in a chair, &amp; which was the <br /> last meeting she attended; <em>her Father
        <br /> departing on the Saturday</em>, &amp; <em>herself on <br /> the Wednesday following</em>.</p>
    <p> He lived in a love communion of <br /> soul with his Redeemer, &amp; after increas- </p>PAGE BREAK <p> sing age &amp; infirmities obliged him to <br /> relinquish his medical profession alto-
      <br /> gether, he enjoyed a sweet sabatic rest, in <br /> his retirement, delighting to speak of <br /> what the Lord had done for his soul, &amp; <br /> always discovering that love to <a
        href=".html">Jesus</a>, which <br /> flows from a sense of his pardoning love.</p>
    <p> Several years back, his recollection began <br /> gradually to fail him, &amp; his mental powers <br /> grew weaker, but his soul continued alive in <br /> those great &amp; momentous subjects
      upon which <br /> he rested all his hopes for present &amp; <br /> eternal salvation. He was for some <br /> time, obliged to take to his bed, being <br /> exceedingly debilitated, &amp; was
      accustomed to <br /> say, I am well, only very weak, I shall go <br /> to my dear Saviour, in his own good time.</p>
    <p> He was sensible to the last, &amp; when visited <br /> by <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Franklin</a> a little before his departure, <br /> he stretched forth his arms in a most af- <br />
      fectionate manner towards him &amp; said: <br /> "Pray with me." He was then observed to <br /> be engaged with his Redeemer, in whom <br /> he had an unshaken confidence, &amp; was <br /> heard
      to say in broken accents, Ye are <br /> come unto <a href="#mlpla000368.html">Mount Zion</a>. Peace &amp; <br />serenity appeared in his countenance, <br /> &amp; nothing seemed to disturb his
      last <br /> moments, his happy soul took flight <br /> into the presence of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>, on the morning <br /> of <em>May 6</em> in the most easy &amp; <br /> gentle manner, &amp;
      thus this aged Pilgrim </p>PAGE BREAK <p> closed his pilgrimage here below, in a <br /> full age, like as a shock of corn cometh <br /> in his season, in the 94<sup>th</sup> year of his <br />
      age, &amp; as a comment upon the words of the <br /> Prophet: The work of righteousness shall <br /> be peace, &amp; the effect of righteousness, <br />quietness &amp; assurance for ever. Isa.
      32.17.</p>
    <p> It was something remarkable that his <br /> daughter <a href=".html">Benigna</a>, who had cared for, <br /> &amp; lived with her aged Father, for upwards <br /> of 20 years, ever since the
      departure of <br /> her late mother, but who had been in <br /> a declining state of health for several <br /> years, departed this life on <em>the 10<sup>th</sup> of the <br /> same month</em>,
      in the 57<sup>th</sup> year of <br /> her age, 4 days after her Father, &amp; their <br /> remains were interred on the <em>13<sup>th</sup></em>, when <br /> this important visitation was
      improved by <br /> addressing a numerous &amp; respectable assembly, <br /> who attended on the occasion in the words <br /> of S<sup>t</sup> Paul to Timothy 2<sup>d</sup> Epistle Chap. 1.12.
      <br /> I know in whom I have believed, &amp; am <br /> persuaded that He, is able to keep that <br /> which I have committed unto him, <br /> against that day. Our late B<sup>r</sup> has <br />
      left behind in this vale of tears, a <br /> son &amp; a daughter &amp; a number of <br /> grandchildren.</p>
