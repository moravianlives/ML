      <h2>Elizabeth Claggett</h2>
      <p> This is a memoir of <br /> S S<sup>r</sup>. <a href="#mlper000228.html">Elizt Claggett</a>. </p>
      <p> She has left in her Choir house a good odour behind her, <br /> so that those who were acquainted with <del>her</del>, and had an <br /> opportunity to converse with her, will always retain
         a <br />blessed remembrance of the grace which our dear <br />Lord had bestowed upon her. </p>
      <p> Tho' she has not, for some time past, frequent<sup>ed</sup> the meetings<br /> on acct of her disorder, yet it was remarkable that she <br /> always had a feeling &amp; partook <sup>of</sup>
         those blessings which <br /> were enjoyed by the Cong<sup>n</sup> or her Choir, and would speak <br /> of it to the S<sup>rs</sup> as if she had been in the meeting. </p>
      <p> Some <del>short</del> time before her dissolution, her peculiar <br /> disposition, namely a shyness to see or speak w<sup>th</sup> any but <br /> a few particular friends, went to an
         extreme, but <br /> this served to her greater humiliation, and she became <br />so loving, that she could not sufficiently express her <br />gratitude, love &amp; thankfulness to all about
         her, <br /> often repeating: I love &amp; thank you, I love &amp; thank<br /> you all. and desired often those who came to her to <br />kiss her. It was a great pleasure to be with her in
         <br /> her last days, the Serenity &amp; happinessof her heart, not- <br /> withstanding her great pains, made her sick room <br />pleasant, tho her disorder would else have been very <br />
         disagreeable to the outw<sup>d</sup> senses of those who came into <br /> the room. At last, her long &amp; ardentwishto be dissolved <br /> and with our Sav<sup>r</sup> came happily to pass
         on the <em>12<sup>th</sup><br />f</em> Inst; with a sensible feeling of her Bridegroom's <br /> Nearess, &amp; w<sup>th</sup> the blessing of her Choir in the 52<sup>th</sup> Yr of <br /> her
         age. </p>

      <p> I was born in <a href="#mlpla000084.html">Yorkshire</a> in the <em>year 1715</em> where I staid with my <br /> Mothers Relations till the <em>year 20</em> in which my
         Mother came &amp; fetch'd me <br /> to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>. I remember to have head some Influences of Grace even in my <br /> Infant years, but when I was about <em>14
            Years of age</em>, I came under strong <br /> Convictions. in the rights I was sometimes so terrified, that I thought I <br /> realy heard the Trumpet give the Signal of our
            Sav<sup>rs</sup> coming to Judgment. <br /> I believed I shou'd be in the Number of those who would call on the Rocks <br /> &amp; mountains to cover them. I made repeated Resolutions of
         devoting my fu- <br /> ture life if <a href=".html">God</a> shou'd spare me a little longer, to his Service. I began to be <br /> pretty diligent in Prayer, both publick &amp; private, &amp;
         in the <em>15<sup>th</sup> year of my Age</em><br /> having now read in Invitation from one of my Aunts in <a href="#mlpla000084.html">Yorkshire</a> a religi- <br /> ous woman, to go &amp;
         stay some Time with her; having first intreated the Lord<br /> with many Tears, that he wou'd direct this affair, I ask'd &amp; obtaind leave of <br /> my Father &amp; Mother to go. She
         encouraged &amp; instructed me as will as she <br /> could, which I prosicuted in my way, but was never satisfied. when I <br /> was <em>17 years old</em>, I went to the Sacrament in the
         Church of England, for the <br /> first Time. I was <em>near 19 years old</em> when I returnd back to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, where <br /> I still continued a kind of
         religious course, but the Gayeties and Divertions of <br /> the Town, strongly took hold of my Heart, till in my <em>21<sup>st</sup> year</em>, when I got such <br /> a sense of the total
         Depravity of my nature, that I believ'd the very marrow of <br /> my Bones was <sup>infected</sup> with sin. I had never heard of any ones being awakend <br /> nor did I know there was such a
         Thing; so I concluded there was not another <br /> such vile wretch existing as my self. I got various Books of Devotion <br /> but cou'd not use any of them; so I concluded they were not
         calculated for <br /> such a Creature as I. I then betook myself to <a href=".html">David's</a> Psalms, &amp; from thence <br /> collected sentences &amp; to Compild Prayers which express'd
         the Language of my <br /> Heart. I often fell prostrate on the Floor &amp; with Floods of Tears, lamented<br /> my wretched state; some-Times I had a Glimmering of hope; these words often
         <br /> aleviated my distress "perfect Love casts out Fear, for Fear hath Tor- <br /> ment, to which my heart answerd "Yes Lord, that Fear hath Torment I know <br /> very well, if there be a
         Love which casts it out, bestow it upon me.<br /> another Text also was much in my mind; Except ye eat the Flesh of the <br /> Son of man &amp; drink his blood ye have no Life in you: to
         which my Heart <br /> replied "where shall I get this Blood? Why in the Sacrament, but that I dare <br /> not partake of lest I eat &amp; drink my own Damnation. (I had intirely left <br />
         off going to the Sacrament, since I came to a sense of my Sinful Nature). <br /> One Day meditating about that Blood, I resolved on a Saints day to go to <br /><a href="#mlpla000359.html">St
            Lawrances Church</a>, &amp; by when I come there if I cou'd venture to go to the <br />Sacrament, I chose that Place rather than my own Parish Church, for my Friends <br /> &amp;
         acquaintance already thought I was out of my Senses, so I concealed every Thing <br /> which had the appearance of Religion as much as I could. accordingly I went to <br /> the above
         mentioned Church: after the first Service I remained dubious whether <br /> I shou'd stay the Sacrament or not; I then opend my common Prayer Book on <br /> these Words of the Psalms, "unto
         the wicked faith <a href=".html">God</a>, why dost thou teach <br /> my Laws or take my Covenant into thy mouth. with this I was quite stund &amp; <br /> thus I went directly <del>out of the
            Church</del> home, &amp; then to my chamber, where I <br /> fell prostrate, &amp; silently pourd forth Streams of Tears. I went on in a <br />disconsolateSolitary way conversing but little
         with any one; at length I con- <br /> tracted some acquaintance with an old women who was a Presbyterian<br /> She some-Times spoke words of Consolation to me, tho' I afterwards believ'd
         <br /> she herself did not understand them. In my <em>22<sup>d</sup> year</em>, during the Passion Week</p>
      
      PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> week I enjoid a particular serenity of mind. being wearied of my own
         strive <br /> ings, &amp; finding my last Resolutions to be but vain; I steid my self in some mea- <br /> sure upon Grace &amp; Mercy, hopeing it might extend even to me. in this week <br />
         I visited that Woman, I told her of my desire to go to the Sacrament, &amp; also <br /> related my Scruples, the encouraged me to venture, saying I shou'd thereby <br /> get strength &amp;
         nourishment to pursue my future course. I thought tho' <br /> our Sav<sup>r </sup>  would not accept of me before, perhaps he will now; so I con- <br /> cluded that if the same stillness
         &amp; composure of mind, I then enjoyd<br /> continued till Sunday I would venture: it continued, &amp; on Easter Sunday I <br /> arose in a calm bowedness of Heart, &amp; went to the early
         Sacrament<br /> which was kept at my own Parish Church. At receiving of the Bread &amp; <br /> Wine, an awe seized one, so that my Hand trembled greatly, which caused <br /> the Minnister to
         stare <del>at stare</del> at me, but the Love, Peace &amp; Joy which <br /> in those moments took Possession of my Soul, words cannot express. </p>
      <p> I return'd home so chearfullightsome &amp; happy, that it seem'd to me as <br /> if I went on Wings. being come Home I met with many Things not very agre- <br /> able, but so passionate as I
         used to be before, now nothing disturbed me; <br /> I loved every Body to exceedingly that <sup>I thought</sup> I could have laid down &amp; let them <br /> tread upon one. I long'd to be
         again at Church out of the Sight &amp; hearing of <br /> Earthly Things, to thither I went again at 10 O'Clock, my Heart was in such a <br /> desolveing condition that the Tears would now
         &amp; then Start out of my Eyes, which <br /> the People observing, told my Relations that now I was indeed gone out of <br /> my senses for I had Wept at Church; which oblig'd me to get a
         retired Seat <br /> among ordinary Old People. In the Nights my Heart would be singing Hosan- <br /> as &amp; Hallelujahs, for I knew not right what to sing or say, nor what had hap- <br />
         pen'd to me; other Things as well as my self seemd alterd, &amp; the Scriptures <br /> as if I had never read them before, but for all this I had Times of Hea- <br /> viness, &amp; if my
         Feeling was long withdrawn, even of doubting of my Sal- <br /> vation. soon after this a poor Woman <sup>coming</sup><del>came</del> to my Fathers House to begg <br /> some relief for her
            Sis<sup>r</sup> who was ill of a Cancer in her Breast, I had a desire<br /> to visit the Sick Person, &amp; accordingly went to her Lodging, there I for the first <br /> time saw <a
            href=".html">Bro<sup>r</sup> Hutton</a> who was then in his Apprenticeship, &amp; thro' his means I <br /> become acqainted with <a href="#mlper000366.html">Whitefield</a> Wesleys &amp;
         others of the Methodists, among <br /> whom I continued till in the year <em>1740</em> when the Bre<sup>n</sup> began their Labour <br /> in <a href="#mlpla000072.html">England</a>. I knew
         directly that they were the People for me, since which <br /> Time I adhered to them entirely. in <em>June 1742</em> I went with great Reluctance<br /> but in compliance with my Fathers
         commands to spend the Summer with <br /> the rest of our Family at <a href="#mlpla000118.html">Broadoaks in Essex</a>, I had been there 2 or 3 <br /> Weeks when as Sitting alone in my Room,
         our Savr presented himself to <br /> my Heart in his bleeding Wounded Form, &amp; brought me into such a converse <br /> with his own dear person, as I had never known before, then it was
         that <br /> my heart went over to Him, then I was willing to live any where, or be any <br /> Thing what might be most pleasing to him. His Blood his Death &amp; Almigh- <br /> ty Atonement
         has since that blest Intercourse, remaind my neverfailing <br /> Source of Comfort &amp; Consolation, in all Trials &amp; Vicissitudes whatsoever. <br /> his Wounds &amp; bitterPassion, his
         Death was my confession, &amp; shall be <br /> till my Eye-Strings break. The Bre<sup>n</sup> &amp; Sis<sup>rs</sup> rejoicd much at my return to <br /><a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>
         at all the Grace our dear Sav<sup>r</sup> had bestowed on me. In <em>June 1742</em><br /> my Father having departed this Life, I went by the Direction of the </p>
      <p>Bre<sup>n</sup> &amp; Sis<sup>rs</sup> to the Childrens Oeconomy in <a href="#mlpla000048.html">Lambs-Inn</a>, where I <br /> lived with the bigger Girls. <em>Oct<sup>r</sup>
            29<sup>th</sup></em> I returnd to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, &amp; on the <br /><em>30<sup>th</sup></em> of the some Instant, that ever memorable day, I was present at the
         <br /> settling of the <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> Cong<sup>n</sup>: what we felt at that time I suppose will by <br /> no Body be forgot who was there till beyond the Grave, I
         thought, this is <br /> none other but the House of God, &amp; here are the Gates of Heaven! There <br /> I got my incontestable Call, to be visibly united to that Body. on <br /> the
            Cong<sup>n</sup> day next following, I was rec'd (viz) on <em>Christmass Day <br /> 1743</em>, &amp; had the Favour of being admitted to the <del>Sacrament</del> next follow- <br /> ing
         Sacrament, which I think to have been <em>Jan. 1743</em>. </p>
      <p>I assisted in the Labour amongst the Single Sis<sup>rs</sup> in <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> according <br /> to my Small abillity till <em>June 1743</em> where I was sent by the
            Cong<sup>n</sup> into <br /><a href="#mlpla000054.html">Yorkshire</a>, to have the joint Care of the Single Sis<sup>rs</sup> Choir f there with <br /> my <a href=".html">Sister Susanna</a>
         &amp; <a href=".html">Sister Lloid</a>. In <em>June 1744</em> I was blest for the <br />Office of Vorsteher of the said Choir, &amp; in <em>Aug<sup>t</sup> following</em>, I rec'd the
         <br />blessing for the office I afterwards held amongst the Single Sis<sup>rs</sup>, during <br /> every anointed Prayer of <a href=".html">Bror Martin Dobers</a>. In that situation I
         continued <br />till my state of health render'd me incapable of serving my dear Sisters<br /> as I had hithertoo done; I then sent my Petitions to dear <a href="#mlper000213.html"
            >Mammagen</a><br /> &amp; <a href="#mlper000341.html">Anna Johanna</a> to send a Sis<sup>r</sup> from <a href="#mlpla000139.html">Germany</a> to supply my Place <br /> which was at length
         granted in the <em>year 1748</em> to the entire satisfac <br /> tion of my Heart. I laid down my Office at our Sav<sup>rs</sup> Feet with <br /> more Inclination than I had at first to
         receive it, <sup>being now more unable to fulfill it</sup> yet awefully con- <br /> ciding how he might have look'd upon my poor services; and if his <br /> Heart cou'd upon the whole be
         satisfied with them? His friendly Counte- <br /> nance cheard me, I begd his absolation for all my Faults Failings, <br /> &amp; Mistakes, &amp; thus with a throughly comforted &amp;
         contented Heart I <br /> enterd into my wish'd for Sabbatick State, I was desirious to go to <br /> the then new settled Oeconomy at <a href="#mlpla000052.html">little-moor</a>, hopeing a
         change of air <br /> might be of Service to me where I continued near a year, &amp; realy <br />did grow a little better, having rec'd a Letter from my <a href="#mlper000213.html">dear
            Mammagen</a><br /> (who was not quite satisfied with my betakeing any self wholy to sick <br /> ness &amp; Retirement) wherein she mentiond in the most loving &amp; kind <br /> manner,
         that she shou'd like to have me go to <a href="#mlpla000035.html">Duckenfield</a> &amp; do what <br /> I could amongst the Single Sis<sup>rs</sup> there: I laid the matter before our
            <br />Sav<sup>r</sup>, &amp; found that notwithstanding the seeming Impossibillity of my <br /> performing the Journey, my heart was never easey, but when I thought <br /> of going: thus I
         came to a Resolution, &amp; having had a blessed Journey <br />I arrived <a href="#mlpla000035.html">there</a><em>May 1749</em>: from whence I return'd with the whole <br />Oeconomy of
            Sis<sup>rs</sup><em>Sept<sup>r</sup> 29<sup>th</sup> 1750</em>. The Bre<sup>n</sup> favour'd me <br /> with one of the Houses on <a href="#mlpla000048.html">Lambs-Hill</a>, where I lived
         <br />chearful &amp; contented only in an exceeding poor state of Health <br /> till <em>Feb<sup>ry</sup> 27<sup>th</sup> 1753</em> when I come into the dear Choir-House. </p>
