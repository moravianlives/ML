					<p>Obituary Notices</p>
					<p> of several persons, who had died at <placeName key="Baildon"
							ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baildon">Bailden</placeName> in the
						<lb/> year 1837, communicated by Br. Libbey, who had <lb/> visited them
						during their last illnesses.</p>
					<p>1. Joseph Bentley</p>
					<p>After the afternoon service on Sunday April 30<hi rend="superscript"
						>th</hi></p>
					<p> I was informed, that a poor man, labouring under a <lb/> mortal disease,
						wished to see me. My informant <lb/> added; "He is very ignorant, having
						never in his <lb/> life attended any place of Worship; but spent it <lb/> in
						sin and wickedness. At the last York Assizes <lb/> he was tried for felony,
						but not convicted, the <lb/> prosecutor; from motives of compassion with
						<lb/> holding the required evidence. He is now suffe- <lb/> ring from a
						blow, received in an affray with <lb/> the gamekeepers on M<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi> F's estate, when detected <lb/> with some of
						his companions in poaching." <lb/> We ascertained, that it was not the <lb/>
						fear of death, which induced him to search for me, <lb/> but that he showed
						some of persistance <lb/> and contrition of spirit; I went to see him, on
						<lb/> as my official notice allowed it.</p>
					<p>When I entered his house and begun to speak <lb/> to him I perceived that the
						wound in his head had <lb/> quite exhausted his strength, and that his mind
						had <lb/> been bewildered by the presence of so many persons <lb/> who in
						the course of the day had come to see him. After </p>

					<p> a few words I asked if he wished me to pray. But <lb/> even this he
						declined, saying, "So many have been <lb/> here today and prayed with me,
						that my head is <lb/> quite confused." I therefore left him, promi- <lb/>
						sing to call again the following day. Feeling an <lb/> increasing interest
						in his case, I repeated my calls <lb/> almost daily, and somedays saw him
						more than once. <lb/> The work of the Holy Spirit on his heart was stri-
						<lb/> kingly evident, and being of an open turn of mind <lb/> his candid
						confession of himself, and the simplici- <lb/> ty of his declaration, made
						the conversations wtih <lb/> him more interesting as the following brief
						<lb/> notices of my interviews with him each show.</p>
					<p><hi rend="underline">May 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>.</hi> He was sitting
						by the fire, and I took <lb/> my seat by the side of him. I had scarecly sat
						down <lb/> when he began very freely to disclose him feelings <lb/> and the
						state of his mind, experiencing very strongly <lb/> fear of death and the
						judgment. He trembled when <lb/> speaking of the crimes he had committed,
						and of his <lb/> approaching death. I felt much for him, and in <lb/> silent
						prayer besought the Lord so to direct my <lb/> words, as to suit his care.
						Turning to him, I said, <lb/> "I come to tell you good news." Instanly he
						exclai- <lb/> med, "What is that?" I continued, "The Lord <lb/>
						<hi rend="underline">loves</hi> you." I shall not easily forget his look,
						<lb/> when he rejoined, <hi rend="underline">That</hi> is impossible! He
						<lb/> cannot love such a wretch as I am." "Listen" </p>
				</div>
				<div type="page" n="3">

					<p> to me," said I, "while I tell you what He has done <lb/> for you. He came
						down from heaven, became <lb/> a poor man and, out of love to you and me and
						<lb/> all sinners, was nailed to the cross, and shed His <lb/> blood to
						purchase pardon &amp; happiness for us." <lb/> He <del>was</del> appeared
						very thoughtful, which I <lb/> quoted several texts of Scripture on this
						subject, <lb/> illustrating it by allusion to common things <lb/> Br. I.
						Terry coming in our conversation was <lb/> interrupted, and I deemed it
						prudent to with <lb/> draw. He prefered my heart and, with tears in his
						<lb/> eyes, said; Please, sir, come again, for you have <lb/> done me good."
						It proved a great encourage <lb/> ment to me when informed by Br. Terry,
						that <lb/> on my leaving the house, the sick man sat silent <lb/> for some
						time and then, turning to Br. T. said, "What <lb/> do you think M<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi>. Libbey has told me? He told me <lb/> that God
						loves me; yes, and he has proved <lb/> it too. The Lord died for me on the
						cross. Is not <lb/> that good news, John?"</p>
					<p>
						<hi rend="underline">May 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>.</hi> I found his
						mind dwelling on the subject <lb/> of the love of God; but still perplexed
						with doubts <lb/> and fears, being not yet able unreservedly to be- <lb/>
						lieve the Gospel. A Divine ray of hope has indeed <lb/> burned into his
						soul, but at sinner unbelief had <lb/> him in bondate. <del>This caused
							him</del> He gave vent </p>

					<p> to his feeling by short sentences, "O that I could <lb/> believe, that mercy
						can be shown to such a wretch <lb/> as me! I cannot pray aright: I cannot
						pray <lb/> enough." I repeated to him the beautiful de- <lb/> clarative of
						our Saviour, "As Moses lifted up the <lb/> serpent in the wilderness, so
						must the Son of Man <lb/> be lifted up, that whoever believeth in Him <lb/>
						should not perish, but have eternal life." /Joh. 3.14/ <lb/>
						<del>I was</del> Having explained it to him by referring <lb/> the case of
						the wounded Israelites, he <del>I</del> exclaimed <lb/> in the simplicity of
						his heart; "Am I only to <lb/> look up?" I replied, "To look up means <lb/>
						to believe, and this is all our Saviour requires <lb/> you to do." "But,"
						said he, "my heart is so very <lb/> wicked; O you do not know what a wicked
						<lb/> man I have been. Since our conversation <lb/> yesterday I have thought
						more of my sins, than <lb/> I did before, and when I think how good God
						<lb/> has been to me, to do so mcuh for me, and that <lb/> He has not cut me
						off in my sins, I see that I <lb/> have been sinning against <hi
							rend="underline">love</hi>; This makes <lb/> me afraid. If I felt as
						good men feel, then I <lb/> could believe there was mercy for me, but, <lb/>
						Oh! I have committed so many sins." To <lb/> this I replied, "If you had
						committed as many <lb/> sins as all the men in the village, I would yet </p>
				</div>
				<div type="page" n="5">

						facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moravianlives/ML/refs/heads/master/IMG/MAF/Ful_3_115_Bentley_Watson_Beck-05.jpg"/>
					<p> encourage you to come to Jesus, for it <del>is</del> stands <lb/> in the
						Bible; The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses <lb/> us from all sin." I further
						showed him, that <lb/> the Israelites were commanded to look to the <lb/>
						brazen serpent <hi rend="underline">because</hi> they were wounded, and
						<lb/> that they were healed when they did look, "so <lb/> must we," said I;
						"we must go to our Saviour, <lb/>
						<hi rend="underline">because</hi> we do not feel <del>happ</del> well and
						happy in <lb/> our minds, <hi rend="underline">beacuse</hi> we are sinners;
						and then He <lb/> will have mercy upon us." "Then," said he, <lb/> "we must
							<hi rend="underline">first</hi> look to Jesus, or believe in Him; <lb/>
						as we shall be pardoned." I replied, "Believe <lb/> on the Lord Jesus Christ
						and thou shalt be saved." <lb/> The word was blessed to his soul.</p>
					<p>
						<hi rend="underline">May 4th:</hi> He expressed some doubts as to his <lb/>
						acceptance at last; and tho' he was evidently <lb/> enjoying a degree of
						rest &amp; peace, yet gloomy <lb/> apprehension of death now and then shot
						across <lb/> his mind. I repeated the words, "Jesus has opened <lb/> the
						kingdom of heaven to all believers", adding, <lb/> "He is the Master of the
						house and the Lord of <lb/> the kingdom, and says, "I have the key of David,
						<lb/> I open the door and no man can shut it, and I shut <lb/> and no man
						can open <del>shut</del> it." I continued, "you <lb/> are the master of your
						own house, If I came <lb/> to see you and found the door fastened I should

				<div type="page" n="6">

					<p> knock; and if you opened the foor I should come <lb/> in. We go by faith to
						our Saviour and ask to be <lb/> admitted into His kingdom; and He says, "I
						<lb/> have set before then an open door and no <lb/> man can shut it! Thus
						hath He opened the <lb/> kingdom of heaven to all believers." He re- <lb/>
						mained thoughtful, but appeared much more <lb/> composed in his mind.</p>
					<p>
						<hi rend="underline">5. May 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>. I found
						him in a most delightful <lb/> state of mind. Among other things he said;
						"When you <lb/> came to see me last Sunday I was as ignorant as a beast.
						<lb/> Some persons told me to pray to God Almighty <del>but</del>
						<lb/>
						<del>I did</del> so to forgive me; but I did not know how to pray <lb/>
						anymore than the ash in the fire. But now when <lb/> I sit alone, or lie
						sleepless in my bed, and think <lb/> of Jesus, how He was a poor man and
						suffered <lb/> for our sins, and how kindly He spoke to the people <lb/> the
						tears run down my face and I can pray to Him <lb/> in my heart; and I feel
						something that tells me, He <lb/> loves <hi rend="underline">me</hi>, and
						will not leave me to perish at last." <lb/> I asked him, "If the Lord should
						be pleased to call you <lb/> soon out of the world, can you be satisfied,
						and can you <lb/> rest on what you have heard?" Looking at me <lb/> with a
						cheerful mien he replied, "To be sure I can; <lb/> what can I want more? Did
						He not die for me, <lb/> and does He not love me. I am a great sinner; but
						<lb/> I shall go to heaven." </p>
					<p><hi rend="underline">May 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>. I saw him for
						the last time, tho' </p>
				</div>
				<div type="page" n="7">
					<pb n="7"
						facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moravianlives/ML/refs/heads/master/IMG/MAF/Ful_3_115_Bentley_Watson_Beck-07.jpg"/>
					<p> I had then no idea that he was so near eternity. His <lb/> expressions were
						not so clear and encouraging as the <lb/> preceding Satturday. This I could
						easily account for <lb/> when he told me, that a great many people had
						called <lb/> on him the day before, and many had prayed with him <lb/> and
						spoken so loud, which had so much affected his head, <lb/> that, /to me his
						own experience/ "I was so weak you <lb/> might have knocked me down with a
						feather." However, <lb/> what he said <del>to</del> of the state of his mind
						showed that <lb/> he still depended for salvation solely on the merits of
						<lb/> Jesus. He departed about 2 o'clock the following <lb/> morning. From
						the testimony of those who were <lb/> with him at the time I have reason to
						believe <lb/> that the Lord graciously supported him in that trying <lb/>
						hour, enabling him to make a good confession of faith <lb/> in the God of
						his salvation. About ten minutes before <lb/> he left this word, he exhorted
						those present to seek <lb/> the Lord, adding, "I shall soon die; but, oh!
						how <lb/> bright, how blinded will the last mintues of my life <lb/> be when
						I am leaving this world of sin and misery, <lb/> and going to see my
						Saviour!"</p>
					<p> My visit to this poor man excited many serious <lb/> reflections. In his
						case I saw in vivid colours <lb/> 1. The unhappiness and folly of sin. My
						blood has <lb/> chilled at the recitals of this man, when relating <lb/> the
						awful course of sin he had led his hairbreadth <lb/> escape from cruel
						death, and the unhappy state <lb/> of his mind during all this time, and, as
						he himself </p>

					<p> expressed it, the heavy load he had had to carry <lb/> warily, the Devil is
						a hard taskmaster.</p>
					<p> 2. The Mercy of God in plucking sinners from ever- <lb/> lasting burning. As
						the good shepherd He had fol- <lb/> lowed this dying sheep thro' all his
						wanderings, <lb/> for it was evident from what he told me, that he had <lb/>
						not been without convictions and reproof of conscience <lb/> while persuing
						his wicked ways, and before his last <lb/> illness. On one occasion his
						remorse of consci- <lb/> ence was so strong, that tho' he set out on a
						Sunday <lb/> morning to join his wicked comerades, the sight
							<del>meeting</del>
						<lb/>
						<del>accidentally</del> of a good man, whom he accidentally <lb/> met, so
						alarmed him, that he turned and leaped <lb/> over a wall, crying like a
						child. He actually turned <lb/> back, andn tried to pray to God, promising
						to lead <lb/> a different life. Scenes of folly again diverted his <lb/>
						mind, and obliterated serious thoughts.</p>
					<p> 3. The power of the Word of the Cross, when accompa- <lb/> nied by the
						influence of the Holy Ghost, whose office it <lb/> is to glorify Jesus, by
						leading poor sinners to faith <lb/> in the atonement.</p>
					<p> 4. How the fruits of the Spirit appear in thou, who <lb/> have faith in
						Jesus, by resignation to the will of God, <lb/> love and thankfulness for
						His mercy - patience <lb/> under affliction - meekness and forgiving of sin
						<lb/> and a desire that others should enjoy [???] happi- <lb/> ness, and
						attain to eternal life. </p>
