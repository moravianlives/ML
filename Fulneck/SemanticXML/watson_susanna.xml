						departed this Life, and as I was of a weakly constitution my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mother took all posible care of me, <add place="above">and</add>
						<hi rend="strikethrough">altho&apos;</hi> her cheif concern was, that I might learn to know &amp; Love our dear <roleName type="honorific">sav<hi rend="superscript"

					<p> Oct<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> 16, where I was rec&apos;d in a loving manner, and found my self quite at home amongst the <orgName en="single sisters choir">Sist<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi></orgName>, till the same <orgName en="œconomy">Oeconimy</orgName> mov&apos;d to <hi rend="strikethrough">the</hi>
						<placeName ref="#mlpla000052">Little Moore</placeName>. soon after our removal I came into an indiferency in my hoart and <hi rend="strikethrough">Suffer&apos;d my</hi> went on
						for some time without much concern about my self or the aim of living with <orgName en="single sisters choir">Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></orgName>. till my faithfull
							<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> thro the convictions of his gracious Spirit brought me again to Recolection, when I found I had not
						follow&apos;d his intention in calling me, which was that I might learn to know and live for him alone in this world; this causd me great uneasinoss, which I cou&apos;d by no
						means get rid of, but my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> did not let me remain long <hi rend="strikethrough">in</hi> before he drew so sensibly near to my heart,
						that I was richly comforted thereby. March 27. 1769 I was rec&apos;d into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> to my real abasement, and went on for Sometime in a humble sence
						of my own unworthiness, but soon lost my self again in my former course of indiferency, about which I become quite distressd and Miserable, till by discoursing with my Labrss I
						found Comfort, and was able to beleive, that our sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> cou&apos;d help me in my dispositition as well as all other failings, if I only kept close to
						Him. May ye 4 the same year I was rec&apos;d into the Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Choir. which together with my becoming a Canditate for the H C<hi rend="superscript"
							>n</hi> in 1770. gave me the oppertunity of feeling more thon ever my natural depravity, as our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> made it a real schooling time to me, I
						try&apos;d all means to little effect to help my self, not knowing our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as the Sinners only friend, till in <add place="above">the</add> midst
						of distress he graciously </p>
					<cb />
					<p> manifested himself to my poor heart in such a lively manner, as crucified for me a lost undone sinner, as if he had been realy present, assuring me at the same time of the
						forgiveness of all my sins, and <add place="above">I</add> cou&apos;d rely upon the allsufficiency of his Merits, as a true poor Sinner, to my inexpresible Joy and Comfort,
						July 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1771 I had the grace to injoy the H C<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> the first time with the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> to my
						unspeakable blossing, the impression of that great grace has been an incouragment to me in the many deviations or mistakes I have been senceible of since that time, to turn to
						my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> who has never fail&apos;d to Comfort &amp; help <hi rend="strikethrough">his poor</hi> me thro&apos; in all
						Circumstances, </p>
					<p> Thus far her own account </p>
					<p> Our Late Sist<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. was of a reserved turn of mind, which brought her sometimes into a little anxiety about herself Which she espressd in few words, but
						in that case our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> faithfullness towards her, Comforted and Supported her, under <add place="above">the</add>
						feeling sence of her own poverty, as well as <add place="above">of</add> her sickly habit of Body, which this last spring took a consumptive turn, whereby the comencement of
						her disolution was - apprehonded. She did not at first take it <add place="above">in</add> that light, but thought, She might still recover, but as her strength daily decreasd
						it became cloar to hor that our sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
						<hi rend="strikethrough">intention</hi> meaning was to prepare her by this sicknoss for himself, </p>
