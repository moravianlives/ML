The Life of the Single Sistr Hanh Mercer
Concerning which She has left the following,
I was Born at Hopton,
in the Parish of Mirfield, Novr 14 1752 and Baptizd in the
Church of England,. My Mother being in Conection with
the Congn, took me to the Meetings as soon as I was capable of
understanding, Where upon a Certain time I got a particular Lively
Impression of Our Savr in His Bleeding Figure, Which Captivated
and ravished my Heart; So that nothing cou'd engage or Draw
my attention any more as formerly with my Brn and Sistrs.
I was then about my ninth year, and went to the Childrens School
which the Sistrs hold at Mirfield which prov'd a real Blessing
and Benifit to me, their relation of the Choir House at Fullneck
together with my own feeling at first Sight of the Choir, there
Wrought in me a great desire to be in their Happy Situation also;
But being so verry young I was persuaded to Settle with my
Parroents till I should be rec'd into the great Girls Choir. My
reception into that Choir was a pleasure to me as I found new
things opening to me; But by degrees I lost something thereby of
my Childlike Joy in our Savr and began to seek my future Satisfaction
from another Source, Having a great desire to see farther into the
Course of things among other young People, and therefore pursos'd
in myself going to service, in Which my Dr Mother being appriz'd of
happily prevented it The Sistrs who hitherto had Visited me, as
well by their Visits, as by other Oportunitys Sought to revive my
now Languishing Desire after their Fellowship, which had the desir'd
Effect as I cou'd not into withstand the conviction of my own Heart
altho' the intire resolution was still wanting. By Occasion of a
Choir Meeting held, at Fullneck to the Great Girls, Our Savr graciously
Drew near to my Heart and anew ingaged me to give my self
up to his Leading and Direction When my desire after the Fellowship


of the Sistrs daily increasd, till I obtain'd Leave to move to my
Dr Choir House at fullneck Where to my great Joy I mov'd Octbr 17; 1767
Here I found it at first somewhat Contrary to my Expectation, not
being thoroughly aquainted with the Source of all true Happiness.
But Our Savr soon led me thro' His Holy Spirit to a deeper
Sense and feeling of my own depravity, which I wou'd gladly have
Conceald from my self as well as others, it being very painfull
to me to See my self just in that light, by reason that I
did not know what a poor Sinner amidst this The feeling sense
of its own wretchedness cou'd enjoy in the allsufficient Merits of
Jesus. But in this case my Choir Labressouress  was of great Service to me
by means of Several Conversations I had with Her Concerning
my Situation as She directed me with all my Misery to Cleave
to our Sav'r with whom I found comfort and Releief.
About this time several of my Room Companions were recd
into the Congn which I also ardently Desir'd, and which Our
Dr Savr also granted me to my Great Joy and abasement Jan 30 1769
I soon perceivd that there was still something wanting and that
I had not yet attaind the full injoyment of true Grace in the
Which However our Dr Savr Granted me.
Blood of Jesus & My reception into the Sistrs Choir May 4
the same year prov'd also the means of a farther Display
of my own Poverty and I found Cause to weep before my Dr
Savr on account of many things in myself about which He
richly Comforted me; tho I was obliged to wait for the H. Communion
Longer then I expectd yet it which turned to my advantage. June 16 1770
I was made partaker of my Lords' Body & Blood in the Holy Communion
to my inexpressible Joy & Humiliation, this inestimable Grace bestowd
upon me led me upon Serious Reflections and Conscious of my Shortness
in every Respect My Dr Savr Comforted & gave me freedom and
Confidence to Draw nigh into Him, as a poor Sinner who had nothing


to rely on But His allsufficient Merits; Thus I went on my
Course Chearfull tho' abased. My Dr Mothers happy Exit
in July 1770 Exited in me a longing Desire to go to Our Savr
But I felt at the same time. His aim with me was not yet
fulfilled But that I should increase in the knowlege and
injoyment of His Dr Person and a more Childlike resignation
& Confident relyance on Him in all Circumstances, which prov'd
a Blessed admonition to me
Having Oberserv'd a laxity in the Lively Feeling of our Savr
which hitherto had Supported me, The late Visitation of C Henry
and Br Latrobe proved particularly blessed to my Heart, as by
this means our Savr led me more especially into the knowlege of
myself; to see many things Wherein I was defective and had
deviated from His aim with me, I was made more Solidly acquainted
with my falling short in Love and attachment to His Dr Person
which caused me many Sinner Tears; Which however proved most
Blessed to me, feeling at the same time His love and Faithfullness
towards poor me The Consideration whereof filled my Heart with Sr
and Thankfullness to my Dr Savr, I was the more put to sh
by His unmerited Favour, When at the Renewal of the Inter
Company, I had the Favour to be addmitted thereto, I full
and gratitude in my Heart to my Dearest Lord for all His a
unmerited grace & favour bestowd upon me His poorest Child, it
bowes me in the Dust before Him, nor can I find any Reason why
He should deal so graciously with me, I feel my Poverty and un
ness, and my Wish is, that He may bring me still more to the
poor Sinners Happiness, and that He may reach His intire
Aim with me
Thus far Her own words


Our Late Sistr was of a weakly Constitution inclinable to a Consumption
The Effects of which she felt several years before Her Dissolution
Which with Her Timorus disposition made Her sometimes thoughtfull
But in Conversation with Her Sistrs it was always Evident that she
was atachd to Our Dr Savr with a belowing Confidence and relyance
on Him as a true Poor Sinnor She had the Grace to love and be
belov'd By Her Sistrs
In the beginning of June 1779 she mov'd into the Sickroom, But was
able to keep up Her Fellowship with the Sistrs by Frequent Visits
in the Rooms for a Considerable time very agreably as also to
go to the Meetings which were a great Refreshment to Her
and notwithstanding Her great weakness, was present at the Choir
Communion in the Hall Sept 4 which was the last time of Her
going out she spent Her time in the Sickroom very agreably
more especialy after it was quite Clear to Her that Our Saviour
wou'd take Her at this time to Himself when she Childlikely resign'd
Herself intirely to Him and was remarkably Chearfull and lively.
She bore Her Pain with Patience and Resignation, and spoke at
intervals to the Joy and Satisfaction of every one Present, How
ardently she Long'd to be with our Savr desireing them to pray
our Savr soon to come and take her to himself waiting in a
tender Longing for the last Kiss From His Pale Lips to which
he graciously granted Her Nov 12 about 6 in the Evening
when she departed Happily with the Blessing of Her Choir
in the 21 year of Her Age
