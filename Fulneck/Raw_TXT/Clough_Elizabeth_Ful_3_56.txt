The Course of Life of Eliz Clough who
was Born Febr 27th 1751, Baptzd by the Brns
dureing her childrens years she frequented the meeting
of the Brns & was one of the first children that the
School at Gomersal was began with; & by the oppertunity
she injoyd with the Sisters & Children she got a holy
impression of Her Lost condition, which affected her
so much that she came into a real concern how
She might be saved; thro Earnest prayers & Jesus
after begd our Savr to have many on her, about
Her 13 year she was received into the great girls
Choir & got such an attachment to the same
that she often said I will never be seperated from it.
when Srs Cennik came to live at Gomorsal she
was took into a Band to which she was very faithful
in being present whenever they came together
so long as Her Health permitted; for towards the
conclusion of Her 16 year, she got a Cold which
brought on a voilent pain in Her side,
and continued to Her End. by an oppertunity of a band
Conversation She was askd If she had any
inclination for reception into the congregation
she answerd yes; but an afraid thats Impossable
for me as I live not in the Choirhouse nither
in any of the Oeconomie's, after this it was
perceived she grew more indiffrent, & when


Mary Hapth became sick she desired to have
Her for Her sick waitor, she attended Her in
a faithful manner, but was very Sinsiable
that the fatigue increased Her pain &
mention'd Her consitution
When Her Sick patience departed she attended
Her Corpses to its interment at Fulneck, where
She Heard Br Latrobe speak of the pitiable and
dangerous situation children was Exposed to, who
 was left by their parents in this wicked world; this
subject made such an impression upon Her mind
that it became Her constant prayer to intreat our
dearest savr to take Her home before Her parents
Her pain & weakness perceptabley increased
to gather with a voilent swelling in Her Knee
made every one that saw Her believed Her time
wou'd not belong' yet she had once more a desire
to come to fulneck; to which place Her Br brought
Her. & on Her Bathing once in the Cold Bath
she perceived Herself much worse' the swelling
in Her knee became more dangerous & on applycation

but will wait My Sav no time which I hope will not
be long, all which she done with the Greatest patience
