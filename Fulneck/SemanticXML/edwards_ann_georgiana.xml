						which are gone, a long life which has passed away as a tale which is told. -- What cause do I find for deep humiliation and daring gratitude to my gracious God and Saviours who
						thro&apos; all the changes, and chances of this mortal life, has helped me to this hour, and given me a good hope through grace; I would fain leave a poor but grateful

					<p> of his love, mercy, &amp; forbearing goodness to me, His poor erring child In London I first saw the light, 1783. One of four, two only survived My Father one of a numerous
						family was early cast upon the world to obtain his own bread married early My dear old Grandfather I well remember, he had at that time some situation in the India House having
						lost all his property humanly speaking through the carelessness of a female servant. Being then in good trade in Kent she instead of cutting off a </p>
					<cb />
					<p> candle she wanted, burns it off and not taking time to observe whether the wick of the separated part was extinguished, left it, it is supposed still burning. In the night a
						fire broke out, &amp; everything was consumed, nothing being ensured, all was lost As soon as they could came to London, through whom he obtained this situation I know not, but
						that he appeared to me a very dear old man My Father was at this time in the employ of the Right able Hon<hi rend="superscript">able</hi> I Sheridan a noted political

					<p> a Lady related to the late Lady Elizabeth Whitbread Mother of my beloved M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Waldegrave Part of this lady&apos;s fortune was expended to purchase an
						estate in Surry to be settled upon herself and children While we were yet young my Father undertook to be land stewart on to be Bailiff of this estate -- we all removed to the
						country &amp; dwelt in a pretty cottage on the borders of a romantic common Even now the remembrance is sweet and I seem to sink at the fragrance of the beautious Moss roses in
						the little garden before the house. </p>
					<cb />
					<p> Yet there my precious time was wasted there my false views of life were nursed up Our dear parents were strictly moral we went to church and learned catechisms but of the
						depravity of human nature I had no knowledge of vital religion we might be said to be almost as <hi rend="underline">ignorant</hi> as the heathen. I had exalted ideas of what
						human nature might be and aimed with all my might to be what I called good I read with eagerness works of <hi rend="underline">fiction</hi> loved to dwell upon those characters
						who were represented as overcoming all difficulties by their own generosity of heart and nobleness of mind </p>

					<p> I might spend much time in enumerating the trouble this caused me not finding man whose ideas presumed as mine and constantly failing to execute all I intended to do I sighed
						mourning turned back upon myself-indulging a morbid sensibility, finding no rest for the sole of my foot. My gracious God and Saviour in His love and mercy intend that I should
						yet become acquainted with His love and mercy manifested in the redemption of a lost world. About this time the lady of the mansion haveing a dear little boy now old enough to
						comment at least learn A,b,c took a </p>
					<cb />
					<p> fancy to me, requested to have me to care for this little boy, promising to care for me as her own. To the utmost of her power she performed this, but it would surprise many,
						to hear of the straits to which she was too often reduced, by the thoughtless extravagance of her husband having some qualities she admired, my selfrighteous delusions were
						strengthened After a few years upon the marriage of <del>our</del>

					<p> much rejoicing but in a few years came a sad reverse my brother in law&apos;s affairs became embarrassed and alas! he concealed the embarrassment from my sister till the last
						moment, from mistaken feelings of shame and tenderness and thus put it out of her power to help to avert the impending ruin His friends helped him but a dealer in cattle he
						failed to a large amount in the end my sister and her two dear boys returned to the parental roof and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Whitburn went out to the Cape of Good Hope

						think it providential, we did. We saw a great deal of the countty but grieving over the troubles of my family I enjoyed much less than I might have done; and at the end of two
