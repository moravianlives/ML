							<l>I was born July 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> 1820 at Mapperley,</l>
							<l>a small village in Derbyshire. My dear</l>
							<l>Mother being a decided child of God</l>
							<l>endeavoured to bring her chldren up</l>
							<l>in the nurture and admonition of the</l>
							<l>Lord; and I do not <hi rend="strikethrough">rember</hi> remember the</l>
							<l>time when my thoughts were not <add place="above">wont to</add></l>
							<l>dwell upon serious things; but alas they</l>
							<l>were too much of a reasoning <add place="above">sceptical</add> nature.</l>
							<l>Very little took place during my childhood</l>
							<l>that is worth<hi rend="strikethrough">y of</hi> recording; I had the priviledge</l>
							<l>of attending a small School, that was kept</l>
							<l>by the daughters of a most worthy and</l>
							<l>excellent Independant Minister, whose</l>
							<l>loving and affectionate manner will ever</l>
							<l>be sweet to my memory. I attended their</l>
							<l>School untill I was in my 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year </l>
							<l>when my dear Mother placed me in the</l>
							<l>Srs House at Ockbrook. where, after a</l>
							<l>few weeks I became exceedingly happy</l>
							<l>and comfortable the life of a S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> House</l>

							<l>cheerful, yet somewhat <add place="above">reserved</add>
								<hi rend="strikethrough">timid</hi> dispo</l>
							<l>sition. In the beginning of 37 I received</l>
							<l>with several others of my companions,</l>
							<l>instruction for confirmation, or rather</l>
							<l>in my case for Adult baptism, my</l>
							<l>dear Mother being a baptist I had </l>
							<l>consequently not received that sacrament</l>
							<l>in infancy; but I cannot say that</l>
							<l>either the instructions or the rite</l>
							<l>itself made any lasting impressions</l>
							<l>upon my mind; I enjoyed the instruc</l>
							<l>tions, as I did, imbibing knowledge</l>
							<l>of any kind that came in my reach. </l>
							<l>Unaware almost to myself, I formed</l>
							<l>my own views on <hi rend="strikethrough">religous</hi> the way of</l>
							<l>Salvation, and as might be expected</l>
							<l>stumbled upon many errors, At one time</l>
							<l>instead of simply going to Jesus,</l>
							<l>I was seeking the <hi rend="underline">fruits</hi> of the Spirit and</l>
							<l>at another I was fully impressed with the</l>
							<l>idea, that tho&apos; I was very very far from</l>
							<l>what I ought to be as a christian, yet I</l>
							<l>must wait the Lord&apos;s time to make</l>
							<l>me different, I could do nothing. At this</l>

						<lg>
							<l>time &quot;Baxters Saints Rest&quot; fell into my</l>
							<l>hands, which by the blessing of the Lord</l>
							<l>made a very deep impression on my mind</l>
							<l>and showed me that there was much for</l>
							<l>me to do, viz an earnestness of spirit, and</l>
							<l>a determination to give the Lord no rest</l>
							<l>till he was graciously pleased to reveal</l>
							<l>himself to me. From this time I was much</l>
							<l>more in earnest, but my adorable Saviour</l>
							<l>was not my all in all; consequently the</l>
							<l>way seemed long and <add place="above">hear I</add> often felt inclined</l>
							<l>to exclaim &quot;who is sufficent for these things!</l>
							<l>In the year 50 I received a call to be the</l>
							<l>Warden of the Single Sisters in Fulneck, </l>
							<l>and tho&apos; deeply conscious of my own insuffi</l>
							<l>ciency for such a post, I felt such a strong</l>
							<l>conviction that it was from the Lord </l>
							<l>I dared do no other than accept it. In the</l>
							<l>first year I had many trials and difficulties</l>
							<l>caused in a great measure by my own</l>
							<l>inexperience, but afterwards my working</l>
							<l>very pleasant, and light to me. The</l>

						<lg>
							<l>my birthday struck me very much on</l>
							<l>looking at them sometime before. The</l>
							<l>daily word was &quot;In the Lord shall all</l>
							<l>the seed of Israel be justified and <add place="above">glory</add> shall </l>
							<l>45<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Isaiah &amp; 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> verse, and the doctrinal</l>
							<l>text was, the second of Acts &amp; the latter part</l>
							<l>of the 47<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> verse &quot;And the Lord added to</l>
							<l>the church daily such as should be saved.&quot;</l>
							<l>I felt to hope that these texts had a reference</l>
							<l>to some that were very near &amp; dear to me, who</l>
							<l>were not added to any christian church,</l>
							<l>and over whom my heart had often yearned.</l>
							<l>I never once thought of them in connection</l>
							<l>with myself, I thought I was added to the</l>
							<l>church, and of the <hi rend="underline">real meaning</hi> of the </l>
							<l>daily word I had at that time very little</l>
							<l>knowledge, oh how possible it is to deceive</l>
							<l>ourselves and others. On the morning of my</l>
							<l>birthday, I found three verses on my table</l>
							<l>which had been drawn and placed there</l>
							<l>by a very dear and worthy sister, as was</l>
							<l>her custom, the three were very striking, but</l>
							<l>the text of one was <hi rend="strikethrough">love</hi> &quot;Lovest thou me&quot;</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<pb />
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>to <add place="above">which</add> was added the verse</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg type="stanza" n="1">
							<l>Lovest thou me I hear the Saviour say,</l>
							<l>Would that my heart had power to </l>
							<l>answer yea: </l>

							<l>And earth beneath, thou knowest that I love</l>

							<l>On reading the last line <add place="above">with clasped hands</add> I exclaimed, oh</l>
							<l>my beloved Saviour that is the very thing</l>
							<l>why <add place="above">didst</add> thou not show me that before. it is</l>

							<l>weight of guilt upon me, that I often</l>
							<l>felt I must sink under it, or that I should</l>
							<l>lose my senses; I stood a guilty hell deserving</l>
							<l>sinner, and felt that I must be lost, if my</l>
							<l>Saviour had not died for me; but I could</l>
							<l>take no comfort, the promises were as tho&apos;</l>

							<l>the text was from some part of John&apos;s first</l>

							<l>been in my thoughts, yet my beloved</l>
							<l>Saviour has never suffered my feet to slide</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Upright in principle &amp; faithful</l>
							<l>in business, she did all she had</l>
							<l>to do, with a single eye to the interest</l>
							<l>of the concern she was entrusted</l>
							<l>with, &amp; never for an hour, would</l>
							<l>sacrifice duty to pleasure.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>To be unexpectedly called upon to </l>
							<l>part with a friend so faithful</l>
							<l>&amp; untiring in her exertions for the</l>
							<l>good of the whole household, does</l>
							<l>indeed fill all our hearts with sorrow,</l>
							<l>We deeply mourn our loss, but we</l>
							<l>cannot but say, that our loss is her</l>
							<l>eternal gain. She knew in whom</l>
							<l>she believed, &amp; when the summons</l>
							<l>came for her to lay by her earthly</l>
							<l>duties, she was enabled to say: &quot;Thy</l>
							<l>will be done!&quot; And we doubt not</l>
							<l>would hear the welcome: &quot;Well</l>
							<l>done good &amp; faithful servant, enter</l>
							<l>thou into the joy of thy Lord!&quot;</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>As a fellow laborer &amp; member of our</l>
							<l>Elders&apos; Conference, our dear S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher</l>
							<l>was much esteemed by us all, for</l>
							<l>the candour of her mind, &amp; her</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<pb />
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>strictly conscientious discharge of</l>
							<l>her official duties. She would ever</l>
							<l>openly &amp; clearly state her views on</l>
							<l>any subject she was interested in,</l>
							<l>&amp; in case of a difference of opinion</l>
							<l>firmly &amp; faithfully maintain her</l>
							<l>cause, without however in the least</l>
							<l>being self opinionated or obstinate.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Her warm interest in the Lords work</l>
							<l>&amp; the spread of His kingdom, both</l>
							<l>at home &amp; abroad, she quietly,</l>
							<l>yet continuously manifested, not</l>
							<l>only unto the Searcher of hearts, who</l>
							<l>delights to hear the prayers of his</l>
							<l>people, when they plead with him</l>
							<l>for the furtherance of his gospel, but</l>
							<l>also unto man, by the lively &amp; intelligent</l>
							<l>interest she always displayed in</l>
							<l>conversations on the subject of</l>
							<l>missionary labours, &amp; by her untiring</l>
							<l>&amp; successful endeavours, to collect</l>
							<l>subscriptions for such objects, as the</l>
							<l>Foreign &amp; Home Missions, the Bible</l>
							<l>Society &amp; so forth. The local committees</l>
							<l>of these associations, will miss in her</l>
							<l>a valued member, &amp; a successful</l>
							<l>collector.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>We were often struck with her correct</l>
							<l>memory of men &amp; things, relating</l>
							<l>to Missionary enterprises, especially</l>
							<l>those connected with our own</l>
							<l>Church, of which she was a very</l>
							<l>consistent &amp; attached member.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>She also took her place as a teacher</l>
							<l>in our Sunday school, &amp; by her</l>
							<l>prayerful &amp; careful preparation for</l>
							<l>her work, succeeded in securing the</l>
							<l>love &amp; gratitude of her scholars, to</l>
							<l>whose hearts her memory is much</l>
							<l>endeared by her valued instructions</l>
							<l>in spiritual things.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>She now rests from her labours, &amp;</l>
							<l>her works do follow her. Whatever</l>
							<l>she did, she did unto the Lord,</l>
							<l>&amp; this imparted real worth to her</l>
							<l>activity. Her memory is dear to</l>
							<l>us.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>When the Minister of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> saw</l>
							<l>her on the evening of the so called</l>
							<l>&quot;Sisters&apos; coming in day,&quot; she was</l>
							<l>remarkably calm &amp; cheerful in her</l>
							<l>mind, &amp; resigned to the Lord, who</l>
							<l>had laid her on a bed of sickness,</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<pb />
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>while the other inmates of the</l>
							<l>house, were holding their festive</l>
							<l>meetings in the adjoining prayer</l>
							<l>hall. For the visit paid to her</l>
							<l>&amp; the prayer offered up by her bed</l>
							<l>side, she expressed her thanks in</l>
							<l>a very cordial &amp; lively manner.</l>
							<l>Little did the Minister think, that</l>
							<l>on his return from Crook, whither</l>
							<l>duty called him away for several</l>
							<l>days, he should no longer be permitted</l>
							<l>to see her among the living.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>To a fellow laborer who visited her</l>
							<l>late on Sunday evening, &amp; who engaged</l>
							<l>in spiritual conversation &amp; prayer</l>
							<l>with the dear patient, she remarked</l>
							<l>on his enquiry, if she felt her Saviour</l>
							<l>near, that He was her only real</l>
							<l>comfort &amp; true support: &quot;for what</l>
							<l>should I do <hi rend="underline">without him</hi> now?&quot;</l>
							<l>And truly He was with her in her</l>
							<l>last hour. Her own memoir tells</l>
							<l>us, that she knew in whom she believed.</l>
							<l>Trusting in his merits, &amp; saved by his</l>
							<l>bloods hedding &amp; death, she gently fell</l>
							<l>asleep in Jesus to be for ever with</l>
							<l>the Lord</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Memoir of S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sarah Ann Fletcher</l>
							<l>who departed at Fulneck on</l>
							<l>the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> December 1869</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>I was born July 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> 1820 at</l>
							<l>Mapperly, a small village in</l>
							<l>Derbyshire.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>My dear mother being a decided</l>
							<l>child of God endeavoured to</l>
							<l>bring her children up in the</l>
							<l>nurture &amp; admonition of the</l>
							<l>Lord; &amp; I do not remember the</l>
							<l>time when my thoughts were</l>
							<l>not wont to dwell upon serious</l>
							<l>things; but, alas! they were too</l>
							<l>much of a reasoning, sceptical</l>
							<l>nature. Very little took place</l>
							<l>during my childhood that is</l>
							<l>worth recording. I had the</l>
							<l>privilege of attending a small</l>
							<l>school, that was kept by the</l>
							<l>daughters of a most worthy &amp;</l>
							<l>excellent Independent Minister,</l>
							<l>whose loving &amp; affectionate manner,</l>

					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>will ever be sweet to my memory.</l>
							<l>I attended their school until I was</l>
							<l>in my 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year, when my dear Mother</l>
							<l>placed me in the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> house at</l>
							<l>Ockbrook, - where, after a few weeks,</l>
							<l>I became exceedingly happy and</l>
							<l>comfortable, the life of a S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> house</l>
							<l>being well adapted to my naturally</l>
							<l>cheerful, yet somewhat reserved</l>
							<l>disposition. </l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>In the beginning of 1837 I received,</l>
							<l>with several others of my companions,</l>
							<l>instruction for confirmation, or rather</l>
							<l>in my case for adult baptism.</l>
							<l>My dear Mother being a Baptist</l>
							<l>I had consequently not received</l>
							<l>that sacrament in infancy. </l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>But I cannot say that either the</l>
							<l>instructions, or the rite itself, made</l>
							<l>any lasting impression on my mind.</l>
							<l>I enjoyed the instructions, as I did</l>
							<l>imbibing knowledge of any kind that</l>
							<l>came in my reach. </l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>Unawares almost to my self, I formed</l>
							<l>my own views on the way of salvation,</l>
							<l>&amp; as might be expected stumbled upon</l>
							<l>many errors. At one time I was</l>
							<l>seeking <hi rend="underline">fruits</hi> of the Spirit, instead of</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<pb />
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>simply going to Jesus, &amp; At another</l>
							<l>time I was fully impressed with</l>
							<l>the idea, that though I was</l>
							<l>very very far from what I ought</l>
							<l>to be as a Christian, yet I must</l>
							<l>wait the Lord&apos;s time to make me</l>
							<l>different, I could do nothing. At</l>
							<l>this time &quot;Baxter&apos;s saints&apos; rest&quot;</l>
							<l>fell into my hands, which by</l>
							<l>the blessing of the Lord made a</l>
							<l>very deep impression on my mind,</l>
							<l>&amp; showed me that there was much</l>
							<l>for me to do, viz. an earnestness of</l>
							<l>Spirit, &amp; a determination to give</l>
							<l>the Lord no rest, till he was gra</l>
							<l>ciously pleased to reveal himself</l>
							<l>to me. From this time I <hi rend="underline">was</hi></l>
							<l>much more in earnest, but my</l>
							<l>adorable Saviour was not my all</l>
							<l>in all; consequently the way seemed</l>
							<l>long &amp; heavy &amp; I often felt inclined</l>
							<l>to exclaim: &quot;Who is sufficent for</l>
							<l>these things!&quot; </l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>In the year 1850 I received a call</l>
							<l>to be the Warden of the S<hi rend="superscript">le</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in Fulneck, </l>
							<l>&amp; though deeply conscious of my own</l>
							<l>insufficiency for such a post, I felt</l>

					</p>

					<pb n="9" facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_53Fletcher-10.jpg" />
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>such a strong conviction that it</l>
							<l>was from the Lord, that I dared</l>
							<l>do no other than accept it. </l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>In the first year I had many trials</l>
							<l>and difficulties, caused in a great</l>
							<l>measure by my own inexperience,</l>
							<l>but afterwards my work was very</l>
							<l>pleasant &amp; light to me. </l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>The 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> year after I came to Fulneck,</l>
							<l>the texts for my birthday struck me</l>
							<l>very much, on looking at them some</l>
							<l>time before. The daily word was:</l>
							<l>&quot;In the Lord shall all the seed of</l>
							<l>Israel be justified &amp; shall glory. Is. 45.25</l>
							<l>&amp; the doctrinal text was, the second of Acts</l>
							<l>&amp; the latter part of the 47<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> verse: &quot;And the</l>
							<l>Lord added to the Church daily such as</l>
							<l>should be saved.&quot; I felt to hope, that</l>
							<l>these texts had a reference to some, that</l>
							<l>were very near &amp; dear to me, who were</l>
							<l>not added to any <hi rend="strikethrough">Church</hi> Christian</l>
							<l>Church, &amp; over whom my heart had</l>
							<l>often yearned. I never thought of</l>
							<l>them in connexion with myself,</l>
							<l>I thought I was added to the Church,</l>
							<l>&amp; of the <hi rend="underline">real meaning</hi> of the daily word</l>
							<l>I had at that time very little knowledge.</l>
							<l>O! how possible it is it is to deceive ourselves</l>
							<l>&amp; others!. On the morning of my birthday</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<pb />
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>I found three verses on my table</l>
							<l>which had been drawn &amp; placed</l>
							<l>there by a very dear &amp; worthy sister, </l>
							<l>as was her custom, the three were</l>
							<l>very striking. The text of one was</l>
							<l>"Lovest thou me?" To which was added</l>
							<l>the verse </l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg type="stanza" n="1">
							<l>"Lovest thou me? I hear my Saviour say,</l>
							<l>"Would that my heart had power</l>
							<l>"to answer, yea, </l>
							<l>"Thou knowest all things, Lord in</l>
							<l>heaven above </l>
							<l>"And earth beneath, thou knowest</l>
							<l>that I love! </l>
							<l>"But &apos;tis not so, - in word, in deed,</l>
							<l>in thought </l>
							<l>"I do not, cannot love thee as I ought;</l>
							<l>"<hi rend="underline">Thy love</hi> must give that power; thy</l>
							<l>love alone!</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>On reading the last line I exclaimed</l>
							<l>with clasped hands, Oh my beloved</l>
							<l>Saviour, that is the very thing </l>
							<l>Why didst thou not show me that</l>
							<l>before. It is indeed <hi rend="underline">thy love</hi> that</l>
							<l>must give <hi rend="underline">me</hi> power to love thee</l>
							<l>in return, there is indeed, &quot;nothing</l>
							<l>worthy of thee but thine own&quot; </l>
							<l>O do thou grant that &quot;with the love</l>
							<l>wherewith thou lovest me, reflected</l>
							<l>on thyself I may love thee!&quot; </l>
							<l>My dear Saviour, had that instant </l>

							<l>drawn me to himself but when</l>
							<l>he put his Holy Spirit into my heart</l>
							<l>Oh the sink of iniquity I saw there </l>
							<l>Sin did indeed revive &amp; I died</l>
							<l>Rom. 7:9. So heavy was the weight</l>
							<l>of guilt upon me, that I often felt</l>
							<l>I must sink under it, or that I should</l>
							<l>lose my senses. I stood a guilty</l>
							<l>hell deserving sinner, &amp; felt that I must</l>
							<l>be lost if my Saviour had not died</l>
							<l>for me, but I could take no comfort;</l>
							<l>the promises were as though I had</l>
							<l>never heard them; except occasionally</l>
							<l>a text such as &quot;For I will not contend</l>
							<l>for ever, neither will I be always wroth:</l>
							<l>for the spirit should fail before me &amp;</l>
							<l>the souls which I have made&quot; Is 57.16</l>
							<l>was a little gleam of sunshine, &amp; then the</l>
							<l>cloud passed over again. I remained</l>
							<l>in this state of mind some weeks, till</l>
							<l>one Sunday evening, the text was</l>
							<l>from some part of John&apos;s first Epistle,</l>
							<l>but what chapter or verse I have no</l>
							<l>recollection from the distressed state</l>
							<l>of my mind. During the sermon</l>
							<l>I earnestly besought the Lord to reveal</l>
							<l>himself to me, &amp; He did. The peace &amp; joy</l>
							<l>that I felt that night, none but a</l>
							<l>pardoned sinner can have any conception</l>
							<l>of I had not a shadow of a doubt</l>

							<l>As a fellow labourer and</l>

							<l>our dear Sr. Fletcher was much</l>
							<l>esteemed by us all for the candour</l>
							<l>of her mind, and her strictly conscien</l>
							<l>tious discharge of her official duties. </l>
							<l>She would ever openly &amp; clearly</l>
							<l>state her views on any subject she</l>
							<l>was interested in, and in case of a</l>
							<l>difference of opinion firmly and</l>
							<l>faithfully maintain her cause,</l>
							<l>without, however, in the least being</l>
							<l>self opinionated or obstinate. Her</l>
							<l>warm interest in the Lord&apos;s work</l>
							<l>and the spread of his kingdom, both</l>
							<l>at home and abroad, she quietly,</l>
							<l>yet continuously manifested, not</l>
							<l>only unto the Searcher of hearts, who</l>

						<lg>
							<l>when they plead with him for the</l>
							<l>furtherance of his gospel, but also unto</l>
							<l>man, by the lively &amp; intelligent</l>
							<l>interest she always displayed in con</l>
							<l>versations on the subject of Missionary</l>
							<l>labours, and by her untiring and</l>
							<l>successful endeavours to collect sub</l>
							<l>scriptions for such objects, as the Foreign</l>
							<l>and Home Missions, the Bible Society,</l>
							<l>and so forth. The local Committees of</l>
							<l>these Associations will miss in her</l>
							<l>a valued member, and a successful</l>
							<l>Collector. We were often struck with</l>
							<l>her correct memory of men and things</l>
							<l>relating to Missionary enterprises,</l>
							<l>especially those connected with our</l>
							<l>own church, of which she was a very</l>
							<l>consistent &amp; attached member.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p>
						<lg>
							<l> She also took her place as a</l>
							<l>Teacher in our Sunday School, and</l>
							<l>by her prayerful and careful prepa</l>
							<l>ration for her work succeeded in</l>
							<l>securing the love and gratitude of</l>
							<l>her Scholars, to whose hearts her memory</l>

							<l>Her memory is dear to us. </l>

							<l>When the Minister of the Congreg<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. </l>
							<l>saw her on the evening of the so called</l>
							<l>Sisters&apos; Coming in Day, she was re</l>
							<l>markably calm and cheerful in her</l>
							<l>mind, and resigned to the Lord, who</l>
							<l>had laid her on a bed of sickness, while</l>
							<l>the other inmates of the house, were holding</l>
							<l>their festive meetings in the adjoining</l>
							<l>Prayer hall. For the visit paid to her,</l>
							<l>and the prayer offered <add place="above">up</add> by her bedside</l>
							<l>she expressed her thanks in a very</l>
							<l>cordial and lively manner. Little</l>
							<l>did the Minister think, that on his</l>
							<l>return from Crook, whither duty called</l>
							<l>him away for several days, he should</l>
							<l>no longer be permitted to see her among</l>
							<l>the living. To a fellow laborer, who</l>

							<l>And truly He was with her in her</l>
