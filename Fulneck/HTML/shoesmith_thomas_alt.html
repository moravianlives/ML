    <p> The Course of Life<br /> of the married Brother <a href="mlper000271.html">Tho<sup>s</sup>. Shoesmith</a><br /> whose Remains were inter'd <em>July 24 1770</em></p>
    <p>He was born <em>Febr 20 1741</em> in <a href="#mlpla000103.html">Norwood Green <br /> in the Parish of Halifax Yorkshire</a>; and<br />baptizd in the Church of England His Parents<br /> being
      some of the first <a href="#mlpla000084.html">Yorkshire</a> People that<br /> adher'd to the Breth<sup>n</sup>perciev'd in his Boys years<br /> that he was often much drawn by our
      dearest<br />Saviour and he knew it himerself but continually<br /> resisted the Grace offerd unto him, and<br /> even hinder'd his B<sup>r</sup> &amp; S<sup>rs</sup> by his bad Course.<br /> He
      did not like to go to the Meetings and would<br /> have even hinder'd his Parents, for which Pur-<br />pose once, <sup>when</sup> he was about <em>14 Years of Age</em>, he<br /> contriv'd to
      behave very badly while they<br /> were gone to the Meetings at <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fullneck</a> that<br /> they might fear to go another Time, but that<br /> Night he could not sleep
      till after Midnight<br /> for the Disquietudeof his Heart and was<br />terribly frighted by a Vision or Spectre <br /> which, he always said, came to him while he <br /> was yet awake. This
      caused him to alter his<br /> Behaviour to an orderly but dejected Course.<br /><em>When he was about 17</em> he obtained Leave to live<br /> in the <a href=".html">Course House</a> where he
      continued 4 </p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> or 5 Years, at first he was therein an hopefull<br /> Youth &amp; was soon reciev'd into the Congregatn<br /> but after a while he became refractory and<br /> so
      very high minded that he lost his Senses<br /> and for some Time it become needfull to keep<br /> him in Chains, when he had recovered so far<br /> as to be able to work for his Living he went
      <br /> to dwell with his Parents, but he still would<br /> go his own bad Way in Disobedience to his<br /> Creator and his Parents, &amp; was so stubborn &amp;<br /> unruly as to shew a
      Disposition to beat his<br /> own Father. Thus it became unavoidable<br /> that he must leave his Fathers House and<br /> seek a Place for himself. He then boarded<br /> for some Time with a
      Relation and went on<br /> in the Worlds bad Ways, but the Convictions of <br /> his Heart often made him uneasy. In about<br /> a Year he sought Acquaintance with his pre-<br />-sent Widow but
      her Relations opposing their<br /> Connexion he came awhile to his Father, and<br />then went to live in <a href="#mlpla000050.html">Leeds</a> where he listed for a<br />Soldier, but soon
      repented it and was got free by<br /> his Father, &amp; soon listed again &amp; repented again<br /> but was then oblig'd to remain a Soldier about<br /> 3 Months, tho' very miserable &amp; much
      shock'd at<br /> the bad actions of his Comerades, till the Soldiers<br /> finding him unfit for their Purpose, gave him<br /> his Discharge in <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>. A
        Bro<sup>r</sup> pitying him<br /> lent him Money to return <sup>to</sup> his Father and he </p>
    <p> came to him sickly &amp; under Convictions. after<br /> living in a <a href="#mlpla000326.html">Brothers House in Pudsey</a> for some<br /> Months he married his present Widow, by<br /> whom
      our Sav<sup>r</sup> has given him one Daugh<sup>tr</sup> who<br /> is still with its Mother in the Care of the Cong<sup>n</sup><br />On <em>March 4 1768</em> He &amp; his Wife at their
      Request<br /> were acknowledged as Members of the Society<br /> His Hot &amp; impatient Temper sometimes still<br /> broke out in a very disagreable Manner when<br /> contradicted the otherwise
      he kept to his Work &amp;<br /> went on orderly. As to his Heart &amp; Conscience he<br /> constantly shewd &amp; express'd himself self condemnd<br />dejected &amp; reserved. When his impending
      Disso<br />-lution began to appear this Spring, by plain<br /> Tokens of a Consumption he could not bear to<br /> hear any Thing of it. The many Mention stir-<br />-ring up an Enmity in him till
      about <em>May 20<sup>th</sup>,</em><br /> one Night he got a gracious Look from his <br />mercifullSav<sup>r</sup> whereby he was quite alterd,<br /> believ'd thenceforward that our Lord would
      take<br /> him in Mercy, became genuinely openhearted<br /> (which had been hitherto wanting) confess'd<br /> that Pride &amp; fleshly Lusts had been the Cause<br /> of all his Deviations, &amp;
      said: the Enmityof ones <br /> own Heart is much worse to bear than <sup>all</sup> bodily<br />Pain. According to his earnest &amp; written <br />        Request he was publickly absolved on
        <em>June 4<sup>th</sup><br /></em>and the whole congregation sung their heartyWish <br /> es for him. As his Body grew weaker he became<br /> more &amp; more desirous of going to Him who
    </p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> died for him, whom he could now look on as his<br /> best Friend. Oh! said he I have been a great Re<br />  bel against our Sav<sup>r</sup> but now He will have<br />Mercy on me
      and I want to go to him this very <br /> 1/4 of hour if it might be while you are here, he<br /> mention'd in a contrite Manner his own bad beha <br />-viour at the Time of his <a href=".html"
          >Bro<sup>r</sup> Stephens</a> last<br /> Sickness, and also to his own Wife at different <br /> Times. On <em>July 16<sup>th</sup></em> His Head continually catchd <br /> as convuls'd in he
      often gaspd for Breath, and <br /> looked ghastly as a dying Man: yet often repeated <br /> very Sweetly: Dearest Sav<sup>r</sup> come &amp; fetch me! <br /> Dearest Lamb! my Saviour! my dear
      Lamb! <br /><a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Greening</a> said: dost Thou then love that Sav<sup>r</sup>? <br /> he replied very earnestly: yes I do love Him, I did <br />long to live for him as a
      Boy: but afterwards I <br /> was unfaithfull but now He has forgiven me <br /> &amp; will be very pretty to live with him for ever, <br /> ah! if I was but with Him! after this by a <br />
      Discharge of much Matter from his Lungs he <br /> was relieved for some Days, once when he had <br /> spoken agood deal of his being a Rebel, &amp; of our <br />Sav<sup>rs</sup> Mercy he said: I
      was once out of my Senses <br /> Oh! I shall have much to thank him for when <br /> I come home! This his ardent Longing to go to <br /> his Souls Redeemer was granted him on <em>July <br /> the
          21<sup>st</sup></em> after receiving the Blessing of the Cong<sup>n</sup><br /> in the 29<sup>th</sup> Year of his Age. </p></body>
