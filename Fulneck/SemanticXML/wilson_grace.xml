					<lb />Grace Willsons
					<lb />was born Ap: 1 1737 at Wortley in the parish of
					<lb />Leeds. My parents belong&apos;d the church of Eng: but
					<lb />frequenting the Brns Meetings, they took us Children very
					<lb /><add place="above">much</add> <del>often</del> with them, My Mother would often Speak with me 
					<lb />concerning how I might love Our Savr but I had no
					<lb />understanding of it yet I felt my self much pleased
					<lb />&amp; my Ears attentively Open to all which I heard the Brn Speak
					<lb />who kept the meetings, &amp; was particularly awe&apos;d and
					<lb />restraind from Many Childest &amp; selfways, thro&apos; a real
					<lb />fear of Griveing our dear Saviour, who had Suffer&apos;d much
					<lb />out of Love to Me. when disobedience over took me it
					<lb />made My mind uneasey &amp; I often went alone to weep,
					<lb />with real Longing to become acquainted with him
					<lb />whom I thus offended</p>
				<p>
					<lb />Bn Helt as Children parent often kept their Meetings
					<lb />And when he Spoak of our Savrs blood &amp; wounds, my
					<lb />Heart filld presantly with Love &amp; tenderness, so that
					<lb />it was a most pleaseing Subject to me, &amp; particularly
					<lb />at one meeting, in which Bn Helt asked The Children
					<lb />Many Questions, concerning our Svrs wounds, &amp; which
					<lb />was The greatest &amp; what it was that pirced our Savrs
					<lb />Side, also what flowed from this Larg wound Hole
					<lb />a particular impression moved my heart, to answer all
					<lb />these Questions, &amp; when I name&apos;d that blood &amp; water
					<lb />flowed out of His Side, I Then was overpowere&apos;d

					<lb />with such a peculiar feeling &amp; that most Lovely
					<lb />form with all His wounds &amp; bruises, stood before me,
					<lb />Now it was quite Clear to me, what had attacked my
					<lb />Heart &amp; drawn me impreceptably thro&apos; my Childrens
					<lb />years, Thus in His dear nearness I went happily on
					<lb />And in My 14 year, I was taken into the Gr Girls
					<lb />Choir, which was a grace &amp; blessing to me; But in some
					<lb />small time after I came into doubting over my self
					<lb />Whether I Stood in a right connection with our Savr
					<lb />for I became quite Miserable, all at once, &amp; feeling my
					<lb />Corrupted Nature, made me disspair of Our Savr Ever
					<lb />havering ought to do with me again, Thus I went on
					<lb />believeing ev&apos;ry body happier then myself, frequently 
					<lb />I beg&apos;d &amp; pray&apos;d my dearest Savr to forgive me all the wretched
					<lb />ness &amp; Sin which I felt in me, &amp; make me once again
					<lb />is happy &amp; his Cherefull Child, at Times I felt some comfort
					<lb />but then again it was with Drawn, yet many a Time
					<lb />Those words was closely impressd on my mind, <hi rend="underline">Thou 
					<lb />Shall be mine</hi> not withstanding my unbeleive
					<lb />prevaild, &amp; this disponding Situation, I kept much too
					<lb />myself, at Last I resolved to Speak about it to my
					<lb />Laboures, who told me just such poor Creatures our Savr
					<lb /><add place="above">wanted</add> who cou&apos;d not help themselves, so that His Grace alone
					<lb />might be the only remidy for their happiness, 
					<lb />This was such a Comfort to my Heart as words cannot
					<lb /><note type="catchword">Express</note>
				
			</p>
					<cb />
			<p>
				
					<lb />yet I found my unbeleive remaining with Me
					<lb />&amp; made me doubtfull over evry comfort
					<lb />Being Once in the preaching I heard the Sin of
					<lb />unbeleive particularly Expleind, &amp; that all our Missery
					<lb />was, the Effects of that great Sin: Here it was, as if
					<lb />Something Spoak loudly in my Ear, &amp; told me, <hi rend="underline">That very
					<lb />Sin keeps Thee from being happy</hi>; I Directly beleived it 
					<lb />to be true, &amp; found my Heart was opening towards our
					<lb />Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, Instantly I begd &amp; pray&apos;d that he wou&apos;d take a
					<lb />way my unbeleive, &amp; give me a full assurance of his
					<lb />rich forgiveness, here my dearest Savr vouch safe to grant
					<lb />The poor petitions of a destressed Heart, feeling what
					<lb />Smart &amp; pain I,d cost Him, bowed me in the very dust, I can
					<lb />never Express how this Sight &amp; feeling of my beloved has 
					<lb />Mended <add place="above">me</add> with abiding grace, Thro&apos; the future
					<lb />moments of my Life? Thus I spent my time in the Gr Girls
					<lb />Choir, as his unworthy Child, relying on his merits
					<lb />and forgiveness as his poor but favour&apos;d <add place="above">sinner</add> parting daily
					<lb />to be more &amp; more to His Hearts Joy, &amp; familiarly conversation
					<lb />with his dear &amp; wounded person? I still live&apos;d with my
					<lb />parents till my 20 year with Longings in my heart to be
					<lb />a Member of the congreg= in the year 57 I went to live
					<lb />in the occonomie at Gomersal, to my great Joy &amp; blessing
					<lb />for my heart; this proved a necessary schooling for me, &amp;
					<lb />in the Same year May 4 I was taken into the Single
					<lb />Sistrs Choir; The blessings of this festival Day will ever be
					<lb />precious to me I laid myself before My Hearts best

					<lb />which render her Course agreeable &amp; Blessed: she often
					<lb />used to speak in a Melted manner about her Election of
