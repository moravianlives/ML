					Our Dear Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ann Taylor was Born in Clagheaton May ye 8<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1731
					in Burstol parich, was Baptis'd &amp; educated a pressbeterian her
					Father dieing when she was only Seven years old, &amp; her Mother
					being in low circumstances &amp; uncapable of taking proper care
					of her, her unkle &amp; Aunt took to her, &amp; soon after her Mother
					dieing also she became entirely under of care of her Aunt
					who in ye year 40 was touch'd in heart by our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> under ye
					preaching of M<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ingham &amp; became a member of that Society,
					to w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> oppertunities she brought ye above child tho: at thatÂ 
					time, much against her inclination, w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> was more for
					playing with other lightminded Children; this she has often
					since reflected on with concern, &amp; expressed her hearty thanks
					to our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; her aunt for their especial care of her at that
					time. In 45 B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Held haveing of care of ye Yorkshire Children
					&amp; she being admited to there meetings soon begun to love
					them &amp; to have a real tender feeling of her heart. In 46 her
					Aunt comeing to live in an oeconomy, a Sutable place was
					provided for her, where she stay'd a year &amp; then left it of her
					own accord, w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> however gave her much Smart afterward.
					for ye year 50 she had ye favour to live with B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Grass at
					Clagheaton who lov'd her tenderly, but they removeing from thence 
					she came to live at Holm with some single women belonging
					to that Society, from, whence she came to live with B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Harlock
					at Lambs Hill, &amp; notwithstanding thus favoured to live with
					Bre<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> yet she co'd not be satisfyed because she was not
					in ye Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> &amp; therefore beg'd to be taken from that place
					thinking if she was but to live in an oeconomy with Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>
					that then she sho'd soonner come to ye enjoyment of that
					happyness w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> she felt she wanted, to w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> priviledge, upon her
					earnest request Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Mary admited her vis: to Hightown, <add place="above">to live with two</add> sisters
					where according to her expectation, she profited much, became solidly

			<p>
				
					aquainted with our d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; her own poor heart, so that she gain'd
					ye love of <del>all</del> her Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> &amp; enjoy'd a real fellowship with them.
					May ye 13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1745 she had ye Grace to become a member of ye Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> to
					her unspeakable consolation. and on ye 20, when ye oeconomy at 
					little Gumersel <add place="above">was </add>setled she had ye favour to be one of that happy
					company, of w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> she was very glad &amp; thankfull, remaining in that
					tender feeling for some time, but her impaticent longing for
					still farther Blessings, often caus'd her pain &amp; w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> was renew'd
					constantly when she Saw ye other Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> go to ye Lords Supper. of 
					wch she spoak in a particular manner once to a Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>, who
					asking her where she thought ye fault lay, answer'd I don't
					know, being advised to make application to our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
					for a right information, &amp; being asshur'd by ye above Sister
					that she was not forgoten. she accordingly did so, &amp; very simply
					said I feel ye fault is all in my self, childlikly beging to
					be still thought on with regard to that matter, which was
					also done. And on ye 13th of July ye same year she had her
					longing desire satisfyed &amp; was made partaker of her Lords
					Corpse's &amp; blood in ye holy Sacrament, w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> proved a real &amp;
					lasting Blessing to her heart. But her natural dispossision
					being some what high, she depriv'd her selfe of many happy
					hours w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> otherwise she might have enjoy'd, &amp; this also gave
					occation of concern to those around her <hi rend="underlined:true;">&amp; some painfull hours</hi>
					But our D<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Lamb who know's all things, found out ways &amp;
					mean's whereby he cou'd constantly bring her again to ye Sinner
					point, ye this made ye Sisters continue their love to her &amp;
					have paticence with her.
				</p>
			<p>
					dec<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> 56 she was leased with a sore cough atended with a pain
					in her side; by ye continuance of w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> it was judg'd would
					prove a Consumption, tho she her selfe did not believe to
					if she was ask'd at any time if she thought she sho'd go home
					of this sickness, sho'd answer no I can't believe I shall
					have that favour yet. But ye disorder encreasing, she came

					upon other thoughts, &amp; said that if she didnot onlter soon it
					would bring her to our Saviour, This made her often wish she 
					might once <add place="above">go</add> to live in ye Choir House &amp; there experience in a 
					more particular manner her choir grace, w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> favour however
					cou'd not be granted her as an inhabitant but was afterwards
					gratifyd in ye respect on account of chaing of air &amp; better
					convenancy, so on ye 13 of June lest she came here to her great
					joy, hopeing that this wou'd be her last home on earth &amp;
					so growing weaker &amp; weaker she whent into ye Sick Room
					Nov<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> ye 4<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> believing that our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> wo'd soon make her
					ready for himself &amp; take her home where allso she wish'd to
					be. It was always ye greatest pleasure to her when any one
					told her, they thought she w'd soon go to her eternal Bridegroom
				</p>
			<p>
					on ye 13 it being ye Elders feastival &amp; she being not able
					to go to ye Hall when ye bell rung for ye absosutation, she 
					fell prostrate in her Sick Room &amp; there rec'd that full &amp; free
					absolution from of hands of her dear Head &amp; Elder to her inexpressable consolation w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> aquainted her dear Sisr. Mary of in
					a very tender manner. On ye 24<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> it being our d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Mamma's Birth
					day &amp; tho: she was not capable of being presant at ye oppertu<add place="above">nities</add>
					yet she enjoy'd ye sweet nearness of her wounded friend ye whole
					day, at night Sisr Mary came to her, &amp; had some very agreeable
					conversation with her, as she many times had, &amp; ye Choir
					now going to enjoy ye cup of thanksgiving, she was told
					of it, when she tenderly beg'd to be a partaker of ye same
					Grace &amp; Blessing w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> favour was also granted her to her
					great Joy &amp; comfort.
				</p>
			<p>
					Sunday 26 she enjoy'd for ye last time ye Corpes &amp; Blood of
					her Beloved in ye Holy Communion.
				</p>
			<p>
					Dec<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> ye 8 one co'd plainly perceive that her dear Bridegroom
					wo'd soon give her ye last kiss, for w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> she most earnestly,
					long'd. on ye 15<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> she spoak in a very tender &amp; feeling
					manner of ye love &amp; faithfullness of her dearest Friend

					who had to closly attended &amp; followed her even from
					her childhood, saying ah! He has been my best friend
					indeed, of whom had a strength, I cou'd day much. at 
					night she pray'd very proveingly to her dear Lamb, often
					uttering in a faultering tone o! dearest Lamb, take me
					if it be thy time, but if I must yet stay longer
					here, then only keep near my heart &amp; give one paticence
					Then speaking to her Sick waiter said, Thou hast many
					things to forgive me, for I have been a very poor child 
					indeed. &amp; so beging pardon in a pretty tender way
					she was assur'd that ye above had not ye least against
					her but realy love'd her. soon after she sent for Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
					Mary with whom she kept a hearty band, telling her
					at ye same time, that she firmly believed that her
					dear spouse w'd fetch her home that night w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> ye
					former question'r, she answer'd, but I am ashured <add place="above">of it</add> ye have
					made out all my matters for my Buring &amp; ever thing,
					w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> I hope will be done acordingly, both to your
					Satisfaction &amp; mine &amp; now I have nothing more to do,
					but am quite ready. Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Mary then going to keep ye evening
					Blessing, she sent her hearty Salutaition by her, to her
					her Choir desireing them all to think of <add place="above">her</add> adding, I know our
					dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> will kiss me home this night, &amp; then I will 
					remember each Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> before him in a particular manner.
					after w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> at Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Marys return she found her still panting
					for ye last kiss, saying o' my dear Lamb: come come soon.
					so she comforted her telling her of that Bloody Sweaty
					agoney w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> her dear Lord had sufferd for her, in the 
					Garden &amp; how on her account he had allso sweated
					death sweat, therefore she sho'd only now have a
