Hanh Maria Green Gr Girl in Littlemore Oconomy went home Feb 27th 1771
She has born at Nabcroft in the Parish of Almunsbury
her Father being a Quaker
August ye 12 1755. She has remarked the following,
Concerning her self,
In my Childrens years, my mother took me to the
Childrens Meetings, where thro my inattention, I got not
much impression, but remaind without any feeling of
my heart, and unknown to my Parents was unhappily
Seduc'd into all that was bad & hurtfull to me,
Our Savr at the same time know his intention with me,
and by means of a Visit at William Stringors, where I
met with Sistr Hondrongon I got a desire, to live with
the Sistrs & coming to fullneck with my Br, increasd
this my Desire, So that I could no longer be Satisfied
at home. My repeated Request was soon granted me
and on the 23 of Jany 1768 I moved from my Parrents,
to the Little Moor Oeconomy. Thus for Our Late Sistr;
Here she was Quite at Home, & settled from the 1st day
and Conducted herself as a still, Orderly, & good Child,
She soon got a longing after holy Baptism, and often
exprest herself in those words Concerning it, tis so
in my Breast, I cannot Quite rest, till Our Savr
can bestow this Blessing upon me, this grace she
obtained Novbr 13 1768 to her great Joy, which prov'd
the happy entrance to a Blessed Period of grace
wherein she learned to know herself, and on Reflection
of her former Course, shed many thousand tears,
till Our Savr gave her the grace, to open her mind to her
Labour'ss which prov'd and abiding Blessing to her,
She was soon after admitted as Candidate for the Holy Commn


and injoyed this highest good, Feby ye 24 1770
it was soon perceptible in her, that Our Savr
had an Extraordinary intention with her which
appear'd by her Simple Confidence in him,
notwithstanding the Sencibility of her own Poverty
about which she often exprest herself, with tears
as the poorest & meanest of all, yet Injoying
a Clearness with Our Savr beyond what was Common
for her years, so that when any thing
painfull Occur'd in her Course; it was soon over
again, She cou'd give it up to Our Savr & go on
her Usual Course Jan ye 29 1771 she began to be
sickly, it was thought & hop'd that the woud soon
be better again, but Our Savr had Compleatd
his work with her, & she was Quite resignd to
his will which she gave the Sistrs to under
stand tho, she was not Quite clear she shou'd
go so soon But on Febr ye 27 between 12 & 1 in ye Morning
She unexpectedly went over in to the arms of
her belov'd, with the Blessing of her Choir
During an inexpressible feeling of the near
Presence & Peace of God
