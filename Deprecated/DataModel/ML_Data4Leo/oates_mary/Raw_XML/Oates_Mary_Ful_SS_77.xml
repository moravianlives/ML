					<l>Sr Mary Oates dictated the following Ap 8th 1812</l>
					<l>Thy blood, thy blood the deed hath wrought ye</l>
					<l>I was born June 26th 1747 in Great Horton, in the Parish</l>
					<l>of Bradford. My father being one of the first Brn there</l>
					<l>he was called home to our Saviour when I was only 2 yrs</l>
					<l>old, and my Mother was left with five children of whom</l>
					<l>I was the youngest, I can remember when very young being</l>
					<l>sent to the Children&apos;s meetings and liked them very much</l>
					<l>and hearing of our Saviours love to children, made an</l>
					<l>imprewssion on my heart and that verse; Dearest childn</l>
					<l>hark and see, what a Saviour now have we prove&apos;d a bles</l>
					<l>sing to me. But yet I sport the years of my youth</l>
					<l>without knowing or experiencing much, untill I was</l>
					<l>anout 18 years. I had a great desire to live in a Congn but</l>
					<l>as I wa sthe only daughter, I could not leave my mother,</l>
					<l>It was at that time the custom, that those who lived</l>
					<l>in the Country might not have the priveledge to be</l>
					<l>re&apos;d into the Congn and to partake of the H Comn. On this</l>
					<l>account I felt very unhappy, as it appeared to me that I </l>
					<l>could neither enjoy the Congn nor the World. I now fully,</l>
					<l>experienced the truth of that text. The carnal mind is</l>
					<l>enmity with God. I felt my sinful inclinations, and the</l>
					<l>desire to enjoy the World, so strong that I sometimes</l>
					<l>thought; I did not care what became of me, I said once in</l>
					<l>my grief, I will never be in the Congn yet my heart condemnd</l>
					<l>me. One night when I had fully determined to drop all</l>
					<l>connection with the Brns people. </l>
					<l>I recd a hurt on my</l>

				<lg>
					<l>neck in fetching water from a well; I suffered great pain,</l>
					<l>and was brought into a very weak state of health. As soon</l>
					<l>as I was able I went to Fulnec, and called to see Sr Seidel</l>
					<l>who was then the Labouress, she looked earnestly at me</l>
					<l>and asked what I thought, for if the hurt had turned</l>
					<l>inwardly, I might have died in a moment, this was</l>
					<l>like a thunderbolt to my soul. I went to the preaching</l>
					<l>but could hear nothing for misiry feeling that I was not</l>
					<l>let to die. I returned home but had no rest. reflecting</l>
					<l>on my unhappy state, my earnest pray&apos;r and desire</l>
					<l>was now that our Saviour would pardon all my sins.</l>
					<l>At that time there much said in the meetings,</l>
					<l>if we had any </l>
					<l>that clearness of our sinfulness, we should see our Saviour</l>
					<l>in his crucified form, this brought me into self working</l>
					<l>and I thought that I never could be saved unless I had</l>
					<l>that particular manifestation in which I heard it describd</l>
					<l>However one morning when I awoke, it was as if our</l>
					<l>Saviour said to me. I know the thoughts which I think</l>
					<l>towards thee, thoughts of peace? that word peace.</l>
					<l>comforted my heart, and has always been something</l>
					<l>to me thro my future course, This was in my 23rd</l>
					<l>year. I now felt a great desire to be recd into the Congn</l>
					<l>that favour was granted me April 12th 1773. and the </l>
					<l>peace of God which I felt on that occasion, I shall</l>
					<l>never forget. I now spent my time happily and</l>
					<l>enjoyed the meetings, when I awoke in the mong</l>
					<l>it was my first pleasing thought. I shall hear of</l>
					<l>our Saviour to day. I wished much to partake of </l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>the H. Comn but it was long before that favour was gran</l>
					<l>me. A conversation previous to it with the late Br</l>
					<l>Tranecker, proved a great blessing to me, He asked if</l>
					<l>I had felt a clearness that our Saviour had pardoned all</l>
					<l>my sins, to which I answered as mentioned before, upon</l>
					<l>he spoke very encouraging words to me, and said that</l>
					<l>our Saviours ways were different with every poor sinners.</l>
					<l>Decr 8th 1776 I had the favour to partake for the first</l>
					<l>time of the H Comn. In 1779 I removed with my Mother</l>
					<l>Bankhouse, where I spent 3 years very comfortably, tho</l>
					<l>I had many schol schools for my own heart. but our Savior</l>
					<l>helped me and proved my faithful friend.</l>
					<l>After the happy departure of my dear Mother whom</l>
					<l>I nursed to my end, I went to live at Heckmondwyke</l>
					<l>to care for my Br Children, where I staid until</l>
					<l>June 28th 1783 when I came to the Srs house here.</l>
					<l>I entered this house with my whole heart, according</l>
					<l>to my wished for desire, and no trials whatsoever have</l>
					<l>made me wish to leave it. My own temper and work</l>
					<l>made it sometimes trying, but little uneasinesses</l>
					<l>were soon settled again, and I can truly say that my</l>
					<l>living in this house has proved a Blessing to me.</l>
					<l>Where I have learned to know more of myself and of</l>
					<l>our Saviours leading</l>
					<l>Had I not thee O Lamb of God once bleeding</l>
					<l>Were not thy blood for me a sinner pleading</l>
					<l>Where should I poorest among all the needy</l>
					<l>Find succour ready</l>

					<l>In 1799 my Niece Rachel Oats, with whom I had</l>
					<l>lived 16 years in the Srs house, was married to Br</l>
					<l>Jackson and went to Jamacia, and two months after</l>
					<l>oldest </l>
					<l>my Br who had been as a father to me, departed happily</l>
					<l>These sircumstances were great trials to me, and made</l>
					<l>me look earnestly to our Saviour, for His help even</l>
					<l>in externals and He has never put me to shame.</l>
					<l>I now commend all my friends and relations to </l>
					<l>the Lord, may He bless them with spiritual &amp;</l>
					<l>temporal Blessings and may he help &amp; support</l>
					<l>me, thro this Vale of tears till I shall have the</l>
					<l>favour to see Him face to face</l>
