    <h2>Philip Henry Molther</h2>
    <p> Life of brother<a href="#mlper000561.html">Philip Henry Mol- <br /> ther</a> who departed at <a href="#mlpla000025.html">Bedford</a><em>Sept<sup>r</sup> 9. 1780</em>. <br /> extracted from his
      own manuscripts. <br /> I was born in the <em>year 1714 Dec the 28<sup>th</sup></em> at <br /><a href=".html">Imsheim</a> in the vicinity of <a href=".html">Bussweiler in Elsa- <br /> tia</a>
      where my father was the parish minister. <br /><em>Being 8 years old</em>, I was sent to the school <br /> at <a href=".html">Bussweiler</a> with a view to lay the first <br /> foundation for
      studying divinity. I felt <br /> already in my infancy that the friend and <br /> Redeemer of my soul was drawing me <br /> by his grace. Tho' I had many bad <br /> examples before me, I
      remained in inocent <br /> simplicity till in my <em>14<sup>th</sup> year</em>, when I <br /> was seduced into sin by one of my school <br /> fellows. Sin begat death, and my conscience <br />
      was repeatedly alarmed with this dreadful<br /> sentence: "Thou art doomed to death", which <br /> caused me to feel unceasing anxietyof heart, <br /> &amp; imbittered the sinful pleasures of
      life to me, </p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> serving, through the kind care of the lover of my <br /> soul, as a barrier, which prevented me from <br /> rushing into misery. <em>In the year 1734</em><br /> I
      was sent by my parents to <a href=".html">Metz</a> in <br /><a href=".html">France</a> in order to learn the french language <br />Our Saviour pursued me also here by his <br />Grace in many
      ways. Being once in <br /> company with my french master, I accom <br /> panied him at night to his lodgings seeming <br /> ly in good health. The next morning I was <br />thunderstruck at
      hearing that he was dead, <br /> as my conscience forced immediatly this <br /> question upon me: what would have be- <br /> come of you if this had been your case? <br />I hastened to my room
      trembling, and<br />throwing myself on the ground, and prayed<br /> to an unknown <a href=".html">God</a> for Grace and conver- <br /> sion of heart from sin. But sometime <br /> after I fell
      again into a dilatory track. <br /> In the <em>year 1735</em> I went to the university </p>
    <p> at <a href=".html">Jena</a>, on which occasion I prayed to <a href=".html">God</a> with <br /> a concernedheart to preserve me from seduction <br /> and convert me. This prayer I repeated very
      <br /> often as I knew how hurtful bad the time <br /> was spent by the major part of the students, <br /> being afraid of falling into the same trade <br /> Soon after my arrival the late
        brother<a href=".html">Daer- <br /> baum</a> went with me to the meetings of <br /> edification, held by the Rev<sup>d</sup> M<sup>r</sup><a href=".html">Brumhards</a><br /> Here I heard for
      the first time of <a href=".html">Jesus</a><br /> readiness to receive the poorest and most <br />miserable sinners which proved to me, a <br /> word worthy of acceptation. After the meeting
      <br /> I went to my lodgings and cast myself <br /> at the feet of the friend of sinners, entrea- <br /> ting Him with many tears to have mercy<br /> upon me, and to assure me of my being <br />
      accepted of him by delivering me from <br /> the dominions of sin in soul and body which <br /> had been on for some time a most grievous<br /> burthen to me. He caused me to look in </p>PAGE
    BREAK 
    
    <p> that moment believingly to Him, in a manner <br /> as I had never been able to do, and I <br /> felt that sin had been <del>laimed</del> maimed <br /> and lost its force. Declining the
      propo- <br /> sal of my Father, to return home and <br /> to accept of a living, he withdrew his <br /> asistance, which on the one hand obliged <br /> me to find my support by teaching frensh
      <br /> but set me on the other hand at liberty <br /> from accepting my father's proposal con <br /> trary to the dictates of my heart. <a href=".html">Christian <br /><sup>Renatus de</sup>
        Zinzendorf</a> coming in the year <em>1737</em><br /> under the care of <a href=".html">John Nitchman</a>, to <br /><a href=".html">Jena</a>, I had the pleasureto be his teacher <br /> in
      music and the frensh language. About easter<em>the same year</em> the late ordinar <br /> travelling through <a href=".html">Jena</a>, he had an enteview <br /> with all those who were employed
      to teach <br /> his son, and asked every one, after he had <br /> first spoke with each of us separately: <br />Wether we were willing to devote ourselves </p>
    <p> to our Saviour and the Congregation, and <br /><sup>were </sup>desirous to be prepared for serving our Saviour<br /> Every one said yes. But the question being <br /> put to me, I answered: "I
      am convinced <br /> that I ought to devote myself to our <br />Saviour, and to be converted to him with <br /> my whole heart, for not doing it will <br /> render me an unfortunate man. But to
      <br /> be devoted to the Congregation I do not <br /> understand." He replied: "It is very well, <br /> this matter is only for such as understand <br /> it, meanwhile you may continue to
      instruct <br /> my son". In <em>June of the same year</em> our <br />Saviour was pleased to convince me, in <br /> a most striking manner of my call <br /> of to the brethren's church, which
      time I <br /> never shall forget. Till now I thought <br /> as is common in my circumstances, that <br /> I was bound in duty to serve my native <br /> country, which had prevented me from to
    </p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> see or attend to our Saviour's views with me. <br /> Previous to my going to doctor<a href=".html">Hamburgers</a><br /> lectures upon natural philosophy, I <br /> meditated
      about myself and prayed to <br /> our Saviour, who was pleased to speak <br />to my heart and to lead me into a serious<br /> consideration concerning my past and <br /> future course. The
      following questions <br /> were brought home to my heart: "What will <br /> become of you at last and in what manner <br /> will your studies terminate? You can't stay <br /> always at the
      university. If you become <br /> a minister in your native country what <br /> benefit will it be of to you on others; <br /> for if you go without being sent by me, you <br /> will be an
      unprofitable servant, and it <br /> may terminate with you as with other awa- <br /> kened students who did not prosper." If<br /> you will save your soul take refuge to <br /> the
      brethrenscongregation" &amp;c. These and </p>
    <p> others considerations came with such clearness <br />into my heartas if our Saviour was pre- <br /> sent and speaking to me, and I was en- <br /> abled to acquiesce and say amen to all,
      <br />with my whole heart. Now I knew <br /> what I was about, heard and saw every <br /> thing in another light, and my eye being <br /> single the whole body was light, so that <br /> I could
      not help wondering at the change <br /> wrought in me. I moved with the consent <br /> of <a href=".html">John Nitchman</a> in the <em>month of July</em><br /> into the <sup>house</sup> of of
      the young count, and <del>which</del> was <br />exceedingly happy in the company of the <br />brethren. <a href=".html">John Nitchman</a> was beloved<br /> and respected as a father among us,
      and <br /> cared for the good of our souls with <br />much love and faithfulness. Our main <br /> view was to become like little children, and <br /> such a spirit of love and zeal prevailed
      <br /> among us, that we sat many a night </p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> till one a clock together, speaking of the <br /> state of our souls and singing praises to <br /> him, who had chosen us from before
      the <br /> foundation of the world, and called us <br /> from among the confusion of the learned <br /> world to his people, and to whom we <br /> now wished to devote ourselves, with heart-
      <br /> feltjoy as living sacrifices. In the <em>year <br /> 1733</em> we went with the <a href=".html">young count</a> to <a href=".html">Berlin</a><br /> where his father resided, having about
      70 pil <br /> grims with him. This was a blessed time <br /> for me. The singing of the brethren and <br />Sisters and the discourses of the late ordinary <br /> were attended with unction and
      the demons- <br /> tration of the spirit of <a href=".html">God</a>. <em>Feb<sup>y</sup> the 8<sup>th</sup></em><br /> I was received into the cong<sup>n</sup> and the
      <em>22<sup>d</sup></em><br /> I was admitted to the Lord's supper. </p>
    <p>Tho our lord had givin given me striking<br /> proofs of his Grace, I was yet subject <br /> to many changes. This true foundation </p>
    <p> was laid in my heart, and I was delivered <br /> from sin. But being ignorant of the previ- <br /> ledges our Saviour's patients are intitled <br /> to, I perplexed myself often at feeling
      <br /> my innate depravity and did not know <br /> how to look upon it. But now it pleased<br /> the friend of my soul to remove this by gran- <br /> ting me the favor to cast a believing look
      <br /> upon Him as my all sufficient Saviour; for <br /> being at the comn Liturgy in deep and grate- <br /> ful meditation concerning the great favor I <br /> had enjoyed in eating and drinking
      the flesh <br /> and blood of the son of man sacramentally, <br /> and sighing to him, to make me quite happy; <br />he appeared in<sup>such</sup> a most striking manner <br />to my heart as my
      bleeding and suffering<br />Redeemer, that I melted into tears like <br /> wax before the fire. From that time I <br /> proceeded from grace to grace and the <br /> connexion with Him my
      belovedLord whose </p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p>love had captivated my heart became <br /> daily more confident, and my <del>gracious</del><br /> call<sup>of Grace</sup> to belong to the congn more impor-
      <br /> tant and precious. Having stayed 5 months <br /> at <a href=".html">Berlin</a> we returned to <a href=".html">Jena</a> where the <br /> testimony of <a href=".html">Jesu's</a> Blood
      approved itself <br /> as the power of <a href=".html">God</a> to salvation upon many <br /> students and others. In the year <em>1739</em> we <br /> were called to <a href=".html"
        >Wetteravia</a>, which proved a <br /> means to bring me to the Cong<sup>n</sup> at <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marienborn.html">Marien- <br /> born</a>. <em>July the
        1<sup>st</sup></em> the late Ordinary arrived <br /> from <a href=".html">S<sup>t</sup> Thomas</a> in the <a href=".html">Westindies</a>. As soon <br /> as he had saluted me he said: "My
      brother<br /> I have spoken to our Saviour concerning <br /> you, whilst I was at sea. He has ordered <br /> me to mention to you in his name, that <br /> you are to go to <a href=".html"
        >Pensylvania</a> to preach <br /> the gospel in the whole country." I replied: <br /> "Here I am may he do with me what is <br />wellpleasing to him." Soon after I was ordai </p>
    <p> dained a Minister of the brethren's Church, <br /> and went in company with the late ordinary <br /> to a Synodal conf<sup>ce</sup> held at <a
        href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1069495.html">Ebersdorf</a>. Short- <br /> ly before my setting out on my intended <br /> post, he put me to a very severe but blessed<br /> trial by
      saying <sup>before all present</sup> "Our brother<a href=".html">Molter</a> is <br /> now going to <a href=".html">Pensylvania</a>, there he'll perhaps <br /> meet with books wrote against us,
      or hear <br /> many bad things concerning the congregation; <br /> which will confuse his mind and then he <br /> will go from us" &amp; I answered: "I can not <br />boast of myself and make
      fair pro- <br /> misses; but <del>one thing</del>&gt;<sup>this</sup> I can assertain, that <br /> before I prove unfaithful to the Cong<sup>n</sup>, <br /> I must first loose sight, and entirely
      for- <br /> get our Saviour, nothing else can seperate <br /> me from the congregation", At this declara- <br /> tion I could not refrain from tears. My <br /> answer removed his thoughtfulness
      concer- <br /> ning me, and he dismissed me with <del>the</del> a <br />kiss of love and many blessings. I now </p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> went to <a href="#mlpla000001.html">Herrnhut</a>, where I was
      much struck<br /> with the primitive simplicity of the place <br /> and the singing of all the single brethren<br /> who were just going in procession through <br /> the place when I arrived.
      Having enjoy- <br /> ed many blessings during my abode there <br /> I returned to <a href="#mlpla000057.html">Marrienborn</a>, where every <br /> thing relative to my future plan was settled
      <br /> and I was married to <a href=".html">Johanna de Seydewir</a><br /> on the <em>5<sup>th</sup> of sept<sup>r</sup></em>. As circumstances <br /> required my setting out without her,
        <del>she</del> it <br /> was resolved that she should follow me, with <br /> the next company that was to go to <a href="#mlpla000070.html">America</a>. <br /><em>Sept<sup>r</sup> the
          23<sup>d</sup></em> I sat out and arrived at <br /><a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a><em>Oct. the 18<sup>th</sup></em>. As no ship was to <br /> sail <sup>to Pensylvania</sup>till the
        <em>middle of Jan<sup>y</sup></em> I endeavoured <br /> to spend my time as useful as I could, and kept meetings to a member of Germans <br /> who had been awakened by means of the <br />
      testimony of brother<a href=".html">Richter</a>, who <del>was</del><sup>had</sup> de- <br /> parted this life at Algier. to the english </p>
    <p>brethren and Sisters. I kept meetings in the <br /> Latin language, having some body who inter- <br /> preted what I said into english, till I <br /> after sometime ventured to deliver discour-
      <br /> ses in the E. language. There was at <br /> that time a Society at <a href="#mlpla000004.html">Fetterlane</a> which <br /> was begun by b<sup>r</sup>. <a href=".html">Peter Boehler</a>
      and <br /> was then cared for by the Rev<sup>d</sup><a href=".html">John</a> &amp; <br /><a href=".html">charles Wesly</a>. As these people did not <br /> rightly know what they were at they
      were <br /> come into a strangefanatical way, so <br /> that I did not know what to think when <br /> I came for the first time into their mee- <br /> tings and heard them sighgrown and
      howl<br /> in a very strange manner, which they cal- <br /> led the demonstration of the spirit and the <br /> power of <a href=".html">God</a>. at speaking with the indi- <br /> viduals of this
      society, I found many <br />deeply concerned for their souls. As <br /> deficient as I was in expressing myself <br /> in the E. Language, they pressed me so </p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> Seeing that he
      could not obtain his aim<br /> he declined all further fellowship with the <br /> Society, and <del>stood</del><sup>rising</sup>from his seat <del>with</del><br /> He walked out with the words:
      "To me, all <br /> that are the Lord's". Some few followed <br /> him. Some brethren<sup>who</sup> gave me an account <br /> of what had happened, I advised to be <br /> still, and to leave the
      isue to our Saviour. <br /> In <em>August</em>, I had the joy to welcome <br /> my wife here in <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, on her way to <br /><a href="#mlpla000070.html"
        >America</a>. It was left to me to let her <br /> proceed or keep her with me; but being <br /> convinced in my heart that it was the <br />will of our Lord that she should go thither, <br />
      and finding her willing to go, I accom- <br /> panied her on board, where we prostrated <br /> in prayer before our Saviour and cove- <br /> nanted with each other to be and remain <br /> his,
      after which we took an affectionate<br /> leave. In <em>September</em> I was recalled </p>
    <p> from <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> to <a href="#mlpla000057.html">Marrienborn</a>, where having <br /> stayed for some time, I was commissioned to <br /> travel into <a href=".html"
        >france</a>in order to look for such <br /> as were awakened. In <a href=".html">Paris</a> I found <br /> some godly persons who were mysticks and <br />valued the writings of M<sup>rs</sup>.
        <a href=".html">Bourignon</a> and <br /> Mrs <sup>Lady</sup><a href=".html">de Guion</a>. I also learned that there <br /> were a great many more of the same <br /> people who did not venture
      to make them- <br /> selves known. From thence I went to <a href=".html">Lyon</a><br /><a href=".html">Geneve</a> by way of <a href=".html">Lyon</a>, here I stayed with <br /> the late Ordinary
      till <em>May</em> and enjoyed<br /> many blessings. On my road from thence <br /> to <a href=".html">Holland</a>I fell sick, which necessitated <br /> me to stay 10 weeks with my mother. I
      <br /> had no patience to wait till I was recovered, <br /> and before I reached <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q102911.html">Holland</a> the fever <br /> had left me. In <em>Septr</em>
      I arrived at <a href=".html">London</a>, <br /> full of hopes and joy to pursue my destina- <br /> tion to <a href=".html">Pensylvania</a>, but I was again seized </p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> with another
      illness, so that my fellow travel- <br /> lers entered upon their voyage without me. <br /> Tho' it did not appear as if I should <br /> recover, I was informed by a letter that <br /> in case
      of my recovering I was to go <br /> against to <a href=".html">Geneva</a>to serve the awakened souls <br /> in that place. After 9 weeks illness I <br /> sat out for <a href=".html">Geneva</a>,
      where I <sup>arrived</sup> after an <br />agreeable stay of some days at <a href="#mlpla000057.html">Marien- <br /> born</a>, in <em>Feb of the year 1742</em>. I had <br /> not been there above
      a fortnight when <br /> I was ordered by the magistrates, who <br /> were dissatisfied with my stay there, to <br /> quit my private lodgings, and to move <br /> to an inn. Taking a journey in
      the coun- <br /> try I fell sick again &amp; was received and <br /> treated as a servant of <a href=".html">Christ</a> at the house <br /> of M<sup>r</sup>. <a href=".html">Elie Prendhomme</a>,
      to whom I was <br /> recommended by his brother. It proved a <br />great joy to me to see afterwards him and  </p>
    <p> his whole family, to whom I was is much  <br /> indebted, to become children of <a href=".html">God</a> our Saviour. <br /> This was also the <sup>case</sup>with the family of old <br />
      father <a href=".html">Pindent</a>, who at another time served <br /> me in the same kind manner. About this <br /> time I ventured, in reliance upon the help <br /> of our Lord, to translate
      our Hymns into <br /> the frensh language and in about a years <br /> time I got 70 of them printed. In <em>April <br /> 1743</em> I returned to <a href="#mlpla000057.html">Marienborn</a>, where
      I <br />  found my wife, who was arrived from <a href="#mlpla000070.html">Ame- <br /> rica</a> a few days before me. I received her <br /> as if she was given me quite anew by our <br />Saviour.
      After some time we travelled toge- <br /> ther to the Synod, which was held at <a href=".html">Hirsch- <br /> berg</a>. there we were appointed to visit the <br /> awakened souls in <a
        href=".html">Switzerland</a>. This jour- <br /> ney proved very agreeable to us both. When <br /> we were tired of walking we sat down in <br /> a lonely spot and sung a verse, feeling excee
    </p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p>dingly well thereat. In a town called <a href=".html">Speyer</a><br /> where the whole frensh armee was quartered, <br /> we had a narrow escape of being killed, <br /> being
      nearly trodden under foot, by the <br /> horsemen who came from both sides upon us <br /> when we were just under the gate. In <br /> the critical moment, when nothing seemed <br /> to offer for
      our relief, I espied a little <br /> space between the horses, and snatching my <br /> wife into my arms I slipped through, <br /> wondering at and thanking our Lord for his <br />kind
      protection. <em>Nov 13<sup>th</sup></em> I settled the in- <br /> habitants of <a href=".html">Montmirail-house</a> into a cong<sup>n</sup><br />but after some time it was broke up again, <br />
      as we met with opposition in <a href=".html">Switzerland</a><br /> and were even forbid to reside any more <br /> at <a href=".html">Geneva</a>. We now returned again in <em>July <br />
        1745</em> to <a href="#mlpla000057.html">Marienborn</a>. In <em>about the time of <br /> a year</em> we went again into <a href=".html">Switzerland</a>, <del>and</del><del></del><sup>where
        besides my former office</sup> I had also to care for the housekeeping, besides </p>
    <p> this and the journies into the country I was <br /> employed in translating the Cong<sup>n</sup> accounts <br /> into the frensh language, as also with revi- <br /> sing the hymns I had
      translated sometime <br /> ago and adding more hymns to them, which <br /> labour proved a refreshmentto my heart. <br /> As circumstances required again our remo- <br /> val from <a
        href=".html">Montmirail</a>, we met in the hall <br /> for the last time to thank our Saviour for <br /> all the grace he had given us to enjoy in <br /> this place. I arrived at <a
        href=".html">Herrnhaag</a> (in <br /> company of the frensh brethren and Sisters<br /> from <a href="#mlpla000014.html">Montmirail</a>) in the last days of <em>sept<sup>r</sup><br /> of the
        year 1748</em>. My stay here was not <br /> agreeable to me, as I did not like the then </p>
    <p> course of that cong<sup>n</sup>. I therefore kept retired <br /> and in stillness. These circumstances caused <br /> me to search my own heart thoroughly, the <br /> conclusion of which was,
      that our Lord was pleased<br /> to give me a renewed impression of my </p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> election of grace. In <em>1749</em> we were in <br /><a href=".html">Holland</a> and <a
        href="#mlpla000072.html">England</a> with the late ordinary, <br /> in whose house we spent the time very blessedly<br /> In <em>1750</em> we went to <a href="#mlpla000022.html">Barby</a>, in
      hopes that <br /> the frensh brethren and sisters who were <br /> obliged to emigrate with the rest of the b<sup>rn</sup><br />and s<sup>rs</sup> from <a href="#mlpla000014.html">Herrnhaag</a>,
      would find it prac- <br /> ticable to settle there. Meanwhile the <br /><a href=".html">Count of Neuwied</a> altered to receive them <br /> in his Dominions and to grant them liberty <br /> of
      conscience. The late Ordinary having <br /> had an interview with the <a href=".html">count of Neu- <br /> wied</a>, previous to his arival at <a href=".html">Barby</a>, <br /> he acquainted me,
      that he had found a place <br /> for the frensh b<sup>rn</sup> &amp; s<sup>rs</sup> <del>and</del> viz: <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neuwied.html">Neuwied</a>, <br /> and told me to
      prepare for my journey <br /> thither. In <em>sept<sup>r</sup></em> I went to <a href="#mlpla000014.html">Herrnhaag</a><br /> and from thence with some of the frensh <br />brethren and sisters
      to <a href=".html">Neuwied</a>, where we </p>
    <p>arrived <em>Oct the 16<sup>th</sup></em>. Soon after the remain </p>
    <p> der of them <del>frensh</del>brethren &amp; Sisters arrived <br /> with us, after which we all partook of the holy <br /> Com<sup>n</sup> at which our Savioursgrace was power- <br /> ful among
      us. We lived at first together <br /> in one house as one family. Love, simplicity, <br /> and grace and truth ruled among us, and <br /> He who regardeth the ready and poor, walked <br /> in
      our midst and the peace of <a href=".html">God</a> rested <br /> upon this cong<sup>n</sup>. What trials of faith and <br /> patience we had to experience during the <br /> first 4 years is only
      known to our Saviour, <br /> but his faithfulness and support was our <br /> only dependence. These trials were the conse- <br /> quence of our moving to <a href=".html">Neuwied</a> before
      <br /> matters had been finally settled with the <br /><a href=".html">count of Neuwied</a>, for a deportation which <br /> treated afterwards with him in behalf of <br /> the unity returned
      after a stay of 3 weeks <br /> without being able to conclude upon anything, <br /> and we were left upon a very uncertain lasting </p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> meanwhile occurred the wellknown hard trials
      <br /> in <a href="#mlpla000072.html">England</a>, so that the brethren had no time <br /> to think of our settling here upon a sure footing, <br /> and upon all the letters we wrote during
      <br /> the space of 18 months, we received no answer <br /> All the newspapers were filled with the <br /> most bitter speeches against us, which were <br /> often repeated at our windows by
      persons who <br /> were evil inclined. We laid our heavy cir- <br /> cumstances before our Cong<sup>n</sup> who formed the <br /> unanimous resolution to hold out with cou- <br /> rage and
      patience as long as possible. <br /> In the <em>spring of 1753</em> the late ordinary sent <br /> a letter to the <a href=".html">count of Neuwied</a> importing, <br /> that his present
      circumstances made it im- <br /> practicable for him, to assist the establish- <br /> ment of a frensh Cong<sup>n</sup> at <a href=".html">Neuwied</a>, and <br /><del>that</del><sup>the</sup>
      people who had moved thither with <br /> that intent would probably be obliged to <br /> return to <a href=".html">Switzerland</a>. <a href=".html">The Count</a> expressed </p>
    <p> his compassion<sup>for</sup><del>with</del> us and encouraged us <br /> by saying: "<a href=".html">God</a> can still give this matter <br /> a favourable turn and bring it to bear." <br /> In
        <em>Nov.</em> It was resolved in a Cong<sup>n</sup> Council<br /> to send a deputy to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, who was to procure <br /> a final resolution wether we were to
      stay <br /> here or to move away; but our deputy falling <br /> very ill at Z<a href=".html">eist</a> we were obliged to be <br />patient. In <em>July 1754</em> we received the long <br />wished
      for message, wich put an end to all <br /> our <sup>concern</sup> that the Cong<sup>n</sup> was to stay at <br /><a href=".html">Neuwied</a>, to build proper habitations and <br /> was to be
      augmented. The word of the day <br /> when I received this account form <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a><br /> (viz. <em>July the 22<sup>d</sup></em>) was: "The glory of the Lord<br />
      shall be revealed, and all flesh shall ice it <br /> together: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken <br /> it." It is not possible to describe what joy<br /> this account occassioned in the
        Cong<sup>n</sup>.  All <br />praised and adored the Lord for his kindness<br /> towards us. Our concession being drawn, up </p>PAGE BREAK 
    
    <p> and signed in <em>1755</em>, we began to prepare
      for <br /> building and in 3 years time the hall and <br /> 2 Choir houses for the s<sup>r</sup>b<sup>rn</sup> &amp; s<sup>rs</sup> were fini- <br /> shed and sundry houses and gardens bought.
      <br /> The congregation encreased so fast that the <br /> number of souls amounted at the <br /> end of <em>1760</em> to 202. <em>December the 10<sup>th</sup> 1758</em>. <br /> the

      <br /> by brother<a href=".html">Risler</a>, we sat out for <a href="#mlpla000001.html">Herrnhut</a><br /> where we<sup>arrived</sup> after a difficult journey. <br /> Thus far our late brother. </p>
    <p>He stayed with his wife about a year in <br /><a href="#mlpla000001.html">Herrnhut</a> from whence he was called to have <br /> the care of the Cong<sup>n</sup> at <a href=".html">Dublin</a>,
      where they <br /> arrived in the som summer of of <em>1762</em>, previous <br /> to which they had brought their 3 sons to <a href=".html">Cath- <br /> rinenhoff</a>, to be educated in the
      childrens Oec<sup>y</sup>. <br /> In <em>1767</em> he was called to <a href="#mlpla000025.html">Bedford</a> to be <br /> the Minister and Cong<sup>n</sup> helper in that Cong<sup>n</sup><br />It
      is sufficiently known from the reports of </p>
    <p> that Cong<sup>n</sup> with wat what unction and grace he <br /> served it. In <em>1775</em> he was called to the Synod<br /> at <a href="#mlpla000022.html">Barby</a> and consecrated a
      Bishop<br /> of the brethren's Church. Before he returned <br /> to <a href="#mlpla000025.html">Bedford</a> he visited his children in <a href=".html">Uper- <br /> Lusatia </a>and <a
        href=".html">Silivia</a> and the Cong<sup>n</sup> at <a href=".html">Neu- <br /> wied</a> (where his former services are still remembe- <br /> red with gratitude). He returned from thence
      <br /> by way of Z<a href=".html">eist</a> to <a href="#mlpla000025.html">Bedford</a>, where he arrived <br /><em>dec the 12<sup>th</sup></em>. From that time his strength de- <br /> cayed and
      he grew mostly blind. In <em>1779</em><br /> he got a stroke of the palsy which lamed his <br /> right side. <em>about a year</em> after he had another <br /> attack of the same disorder which
      showed <br /> plainly that he was mean his end. He <br /> behaved himself under all these afflictions<br /> as a servant of <a href=".html">Christ</a> and expressed his <br />joy at the prospect
