      <h2>Margaret Mary Woodhouse</h2>
      <p><a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000293.html">Woodhouse</a> <br />I was born <em>Sep<sup>r</sup> 4<sup>th</sup> 1713</em> in the <a
            href="#mlpla000209.html">City of York</a> and baptiz'd in the Ch <br /> of England, was also carefully educated by my Parents, suitable for a <br />Trademans Child, they were particularly
         attentive that I shoud not be se- <br /> duc'd by the world. From my youngest Years I had a secret desire to <br />please<a href=".html">God</a>, and to avoid every thing that was bad, this
         made me very atten <br /> tive to the course of religious people, but my Fathers circumstances <br /> being upon the decline, I was (in order to avoid poverty) necessitated to go to <br />
         Service, Thus I undertook a House-keepers place in a reputable family <br /> in the Country, where my Mistress faithfully instructed me in every <br /> thing she saw me deficient in, and
         among the rest, endeavour'd also to <br /> teach me true holiness, but my heart constantly convicted me that I was <br /> not right. Being now better qualify'd for a larger undertaking, I
         left <br /> this place in hopes of bettering my circumstances, and resolv'd for <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, <br /> where I had two B<sup>rs</sup>in reputable business, I went
         thither by Sea <br /> with some acquaintances, but we had not been out a day before a violent <br /> storm arose, to that 'twas expected we shou'd suffer Shipwreck, but that <br /> we might
         have our lives, it was resolv'd to take to the long boat, but <br /> I was determin'd rather to perish with the Ship, than venture in the <br /> boat, and leave my cloaths behind me, and thus
         suffer'd myself to be <br /> lock'd down in the Cabbin, laid myself on a Bed, never to behold this <br /> world any more, recomending my Soul to <a href=".html">God</a>, and for sometime put
         <br /> my hands over the bed side to feel if the water was approaching, then <br /> drop'd asleep. The Ship weather'd the storm, and the Captain return'd but <br /> how greatly was I supriz'd
         when with dificulty I was awoke, and found <br /> myself still in the Body, and all the vissisitudes of Life yet to go through. </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> which I thought wou'd be buried forever when
         I laid me down. When I <br /> came to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>, my B<sup>rs</sup> took good care of me, but I durst not undertake <br /> a House keepers place in this City, till
         I had first inform'd myself of <br /> what belong'd to such an undertaking, therefore took a House maids<br /> place in an eminent Physicians family, but this proved too hard for me <br />
         and in about a months time, was unable to stand on my Legs, the <br />Doctor hearing of this order'd me into his room, and on examining into <br /> my constitution, came
            <del>upon</del><sup>to speak about</sup> my family and education, and on my telling <sup>him</sup><br /> who I was, my good <del>Lady</del><sup>mistress</sup> answer'd him in French, that
         my Mother was <br /> her near Relation, I was imediately order'd into better care and <sup>an</sup> easier <br /> Situation, which together with some Medicines soon restor'd me to <sup>the
            use of</sup> my <br /> Limbs, I then undertook <sup>the</sup>House Keepers place in the same family, but <br /> cou'd not continue long therein, the other Servants plagueing me incessantly
            <br /><sup>because</sup><del>as</del> I cou'd not join in their extravagant schemes and unfaithfulness to <br /> the prejudice of my good Master and Misstress, therefore without any <br />
         explanation desir'd to be set at Liberty; this was a real disappointment<br /> to them, for they thought they had a faithfull person in their
            <del>circumstan</del><sup>Family</sup><br /><del>ces</del><sup>who also took</sup> care of their Child<sup>n</sup>. A pious Lady who liv'd there, and had <br /> renounc'd the errours of
         the Church of Rome, <del>had also entertain'd hopes</del><sup>wished me</sup><br /><del>of preserving me</del><sup>to remain</sup> in <sup>the</sup><del>a</del> single state <sup>and</sup> to
         live to the <a href=".html">Lord Jesus</a>, and would <br /> have condition'd with me on any terms I pleas'd, if I wou'd remain <br /> with her or this family, but nothing cou'd prevail upon
         me to live among <br /> such a set of Servants as was there; I soon enter'd into a large <sup>grand</sup><del>magnifi</del><br /><del>cent</del> family in <a href="#mlpla000143.html"
            >Bloomsbury Square</a>, here I only staid 11 months, I then <br /> got a House keepers place in a worthy family in <a href="#mlpla000208.html">Berkshire</a>; in about 3 <br /> Years the
         Lady of the Family died, and the whole care fell upon me, to <br /> the great oppression of my mind, for the continual want of the knowledge </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> of my <a href=".html"
         >God</a>imbitter'd every thing to me, and tho' we had family devotion <br /> morning and evening by the Chaplain, all was nothing to me, because the <br /> practice answer'd not to the
         precepts, and I became very miserable; on asking <br /> advice of the Chaplain, he told me to read <a href=".html">Dean Swift</a>, and such like lively<br /> Authors, and visit more in the
         Country, but I resolv'd for <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> to get <br /> better advice, left my good place to the great distress of my worthy Master. <br /> In <a
            href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> I took to the Methodists contrary to the advice of my friends, who <br /> said I shoud lose my Character thereby, <del>and</del><sup>as</sup> they were
         nothing but a <br /> loose <sup>rabble</sup><del>rabbling People</del>. I learnt several branches of business, in order to go no <br /> more to service, but to maintain myself in a single
         state, but this was of no long <br /> duration, being much importun'd to go to my late place in <a href="#mlpla000208.html">Berkshire</a>, I ven- <br /> turd there again, and continu'd
         several Years, and met with a company of <br /> Single Gentlewomen at <a href="#mlpla000432.html">Windsor</a>, who like me, were seaking after the King- <br /> dom of <a href=".html">God</a>,
         but cou'd meet with no other consolation than the practice of good <br /> morals, and leaving ourselves to the mercy of <a href=".html">God</a>. In the Year <em>1750</em> my <br /> Mother was
         taken very sick, and desired much to see me before her depar <br /> ture, I got leave of my Master to make this visit to <a href="#mlpla000209.html">York</a>, promising <br /> that I wou'd
         return again, but in 10 days after my arrival there, my <br /> dear Mother departed this Life, and my younger B<sup>r</sup> being in good busi- <br /> ness, wou'd not let me leave <a
            href="#mlpla000209.html">York</a> any more, but try'd to settle me in the <br />Confectioners business, and procur'd me an original Shop of this kind, <br /> which thro' his interest
         prov'd amazing<sup>ly</sup> successfull, yet on every relaxation<br /> from business, I was oppress'd with an uneasy mind about being sav'd <br /> and attaining to the Kingdom of that <a
            href=".html">God</a> whom I thought I lov'd, I re- <br /> solv'd to go to the Methodists meetings, especially in the evenings, when no <br /> body that knew me cou'd see me, but was soon
         discover'd by a Lady, who </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> had visited much in the family I liv'd with in <a href="#mlpla000208.html">Berkshire</a> she made <br /> herself known to me, and never let me
         rest unless I went continually <br /> to the means of grace, as she call'd the meeting, but I cou'd not bear <br /> their manner of singing and praying so openly, and she liked, I <br /> also
         thought they wou'd ruin my outward circumstances, as my <br /> House was never free from Methodists and yet I found no rest for <br /> my Soul, but <del>got a bitterness</del><sup>felt an
            Enmity</sup> to <a href=".html">God</a> for calling me to an account for <br /> my sinfull nature, which I neither made, nor wanted to live unto <br /> soon after this 2 persons came into
         my Shop, my Servant whisperd <br /> in my ear that they were Moravians<a href=".html">M<sup>r</sup> and M<sup>rs</sup> Brook</a> by name <br /> I soon found freedom with <a href=".html"
               >M<sup>rs</sup> Brook</a> to tell her my situation of heart. <br /> She desir'd me to be comforted, for the <a href=".html">Lord Jesus</a> wou'd never have convinc'd <br /> me of
            <sup>my</sup> sinfulness, but He wou'd also convince me where a true righ- <br /> teousness abounded, he had paid the ransom for all my sins thro' his <br /> Death and sufferings, and
         wou'd forgive me all if I cou'd but believe <br /> he suffer'd for my sake, and He woud make me happy thro' his merits <br /> without any works of mine, or any thing that any creature cou'd
         help <br /> me to, those were such words as I never heard before, that all my <br />happiness consisted in believing in the <a href=".html">Lord Jesus</a>, all was to me as if <br /> an angel
         from Heaven had been conversing with me, I never know before <br /> that my Redeemer was the <a href=".html">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, she moreover told me <br /> that his grace wou'd regenerate
         my sinfull nature, both Soul &amp; Body <br /> from this time I got other Ideas of my Salvation then I ever had before <br /> and no more thought of being sav'd by my good deeds, yet great
         distress<br /> follow'd me daily. I went one afternoon to <a href=".html">M<sup>rs</sup> Brook</a>, who desir'd me to</p>
      <p><br />stay tea, other company also came in, and among the rest a B<sup>r</sup>. from</p>PAGE BREAK

               >M<sup>rs</sup> Brook</a> and the said B<sup>r</sup>began <br /> such spiritual conversation as I never heard in all my life, and thought <br /> I had neither part nor let in such
         happiness as was to be enjoy'd by <br /> believing in the <a href=".html">Lord Jesus</a>, and I knew not where to hide my face <br /> for shame and perplexity, when the B<sup>r</sup>spoke of
         our Sav<sup>r</sup>forgiveing<br /> him his sins when the most wretched of men, I burst out with involuntary <br /><del>crys</del>Crys for the same Saviour to bless me, and in a moment, I was
         <br /> (as it were) seperated from all bodily sight of the Company, and saw <br /> nothing but my dear Saviour who stood ready to forgive me all my sins,<br />shame and abasement seiz'd me so
         that I knew nothing what I said <br /> or did, my former unbelief and denial of all possibility of having my <br /> sins forgiven while in this Life brought me down into the dust, and <br />
         I was inconsolable, and knew not how to accept such great grace, after <br /> such bold asertions of unbelief as I had made, my senses became more <br /> and more open'd to the great blessing
         our dear Saviour had bestowed <br /> upon me, but my friends durst not leave me above till I came more to <br /> myself, and I was so enfeebled <del>thro'</del>in Body and mind, that for
         sometime <br /> I cou'd hardly stand upon my Legs, and when I was conducted home, <br /> some friends met me there, who, seeing my tears, and hearing my spiritual <br /> conversation, thought
         the Lord had appear'd to me as He did to Paul <br /> and told me that I was now a right Paulist, but my B<sup>r</sup>comprehended <br /> it as what our Sav<sup>r</sup>said to Nicodamus that
         to be truely born again was <br /> a baptizm of the Spirit, I told them, I cou'd say with Job, I have heard of Him, <br /> but now my eyes have seen him, the spirit of prayer was also
         powerfully <br /> with me, I fell on my knees, and all the company with me, but what I said <br /> I do not remember, but was full of astonishment at the great change I had </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p>
         met with, and shed many tears on account of my former unbelief, this <br /> impression abode with me more than a week, which I spent in wonder <br /> at having such a great grace bestow'd on
         me, thro' the merits of our <br />Sav<sup>rs</sup>shedding his blood for the poor human sinfull race of men, and <br /> I asuredly restor'd to the fellowship of my <a href=".html">God</a>, to
         whom I had eternally <br /> belonged, yea, for several weaks if a child had but named the Name <br /> of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>, my heart wou'dcry mine, mine forever, and I was render'd
         <br /> incapable of any other conversation, then about his infinite love to poor <br /> sinners, I beg'd every one who wanted to see me, that they wou'd but <br />love the <a href=".html"
            >Lord Jesus</a>, then all their sins wou'd be forgiven, and the very <br />hankering to sin wou'd thro' that love be mortify'd, and its pow'r to <br /><del>please</del><sup>distress</sup>
         me be taken away, and they <sup>would be</sup> enabled to do the works of righteousness, <br /> and not before, this was a great offence to the Methodists and <br /> many whose heart this
         suited went no more amongst them, but fre- <br /> quented <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000536.html">M<sup>r</sup> Inghams</a> meetings, being now
         asur'din my heart that <br /> the <a href=".html">Lord Jesus</a> had reveal'd <sup>himself thro'</sup> his Holy Spirit within me, and as <br /> the Holy Sacrament was to be the following
         Sunday at my <br />Parish Church, I consulted with my good friend <a href=".html">M<sup>rs</sup> Galantine</a>, <br /> if I shou'd now go to the Holy Com<sup>n</sup>,which she had no
         objection to, <br /> as I cou'd now make a true and sinnerlike confession <del>before the</del><br /> before the Lord, but when I came to the Altar, the awefulness <br /> of the transaction,
         to think that the Body and Blood of God my <br />Saviour wou'd now mix with a poor sinfull human creature so <br /> abas'd me, that I shed numberless tears, I was moreover seiz'd <br /> with
         such a trembling that I had to support myself by the Altar </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> Rails, and thought no other but the person who stood next me and <br /> hear the rattling of my bones; during the
         Ministers prayer <br /> I recover'd, and crept softly to my pew, but cou'd not hide how <br /> much I was affected, on coming home, my B<sup>r</sup> who liv'd near the <br /> Church, prest me
         to go to his House, which I had no mind for, <br /> but to avoid contention in the Street I went with him, but when <br /> he insisted on my staying dinner, such words past betwixt us <br />
         as distress'd me very much, but my remonstrances abaild no- <br /> thing; when dinner was over, I return'd to my own house, shut <br /> myself up, and fell into such distress of mind, as I
         had never <br /> felt in all my Life, I <del>found</del><sup>felt as tho'</sup> that good Spirit the Holy Ghost<br /> had now departed from me, after so many days enjoyment, I look <br /> on
         my whole Salvation as inrecoverable, and that my sins and <br /> transgressions were of a more condemning kind than ever before <br /> as I had been in such a spirit at my B<sup>rs</sup>
         House, just when I <br /> had been at the Holy Com<sup>n</sup>I wrestled and pray'd till I was <br /> quite spent, wou'd have given the whole world for one good thought, <br /> that wou'd
         have pleased<a href=".html">God</a> to have restor'd that good Spirit<br /> again into my heart, for I now felt like one strip'd of all hope, <br /> I neither heard nor saw any creature, and
         resolv'd to abide till <br /> Death <sup>without conversing</sup> with any one, wearied and fatigued with <br /> a distracted mind, I went to Bed, earnestly praying <a href=".html">God</a>
         once <br /> more to have mercy upon me, and I would be more mindfull <br /> how I griev'd his spirit for the future, I slept well, and wak'd <br /> in the morning as happy and compos'd as
         ever. Ah! my Soul <br /> how timerous wer't thou then, then thou wast affraid of </p>PAGE BREAK

         precious, that have been my sheltering place while here, my <br /> vast depravity had not kinder'd thee from looking upon me in love &amp; <br />mercy but to return; Here I was desir'd to
         speak in a Class what the <br />Lord had done for my Soul, but I felt great timerousness, lest in speak- <br /> ing much about it, the Lord wou'd take it from me again, but I suffer'd <br />
         myself to be prevail'd upon, the Company was <a href=".html">M<sup>rs</sup> Galantine</a> and her <br /> acquaintance, to whom I declar'd that the being a miserablewretched<br /> sinner wou'd
         necessitate them to seek acceptance with the <a href=".html">Lord Jesus</a><br /> and whoever cou'd believe that the Lamb of <a href=".html">God</a> was crucified for <br /> their sins, wou'd
         be forgiven, and have everlasting life, and the <br />Holy Spirit wou'd convince them of a righteousness much better than <br /> all they cou'd attain to by their legal prayers and striving
         for per- <br /> fection, this report give great offence, and many said I was a right <br />Moravian, thus I with many others left the Methodists, and took <br /> to <a

         towards the close of the Year <em>1755</em> I had a clear conviction <br /> of my Call to the Cong<sup>n</sup>, and cou'd plainly percieve that <br /> both I, and all I had, belong'd to our
         Saviour and his People, <br /> so that I did not chuse any longer to act in my business <br /> without their approbation, and was to conscientiously bound <br /> to this that I comunicated my
         affairs to <a href=".html">Sis<sup>r</sup>Mary</a> in the <br /> simplest manner I was able, but by her answers, I found </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> that she and the B<sup>rn</sup>were affraid of my
         doing what I shou'd <br /> afterwards repent<sup>of</sup>, and therefore wanted to satisfy me about <br /> staying where I was, this stumbled me, as I believ'd it to be a <br /> work of <a

         repuls'd, yet my dear Saviour<br /> has sufficiently let me see, what kind intentions he had towards <br /> me in bringing in to <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, tho' I have often

         return, I re- <br /> ciev'd a most cordial letter from <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000544.html">B<sup>r</sup>Charlesworth</a>, this <br />
         encourag'd me to ask for Reception into the Cong<sup>n</sup>but was told <br /> it wou'd avail me nothing at such a distance, after another visit <br /> to <a href="#mlpla000003.html"
            >Fulneck</a> I was better satisfy'd, was also refresh'd with Cong<sup>n</sup> <br /> accounts being sent me, and always felt well when there was <br /> nothing between the
         Cong<sup>n</sup>and me, so that I found our Sav<sup>r</sup><br /> and his People were inseparable, which I often wonder'd at, for <br /> I was His, but shou'd have been glad to have been

      <p> the Cong<sup>n</sup>and accordingly soon settled my affairs. <em>May 10<sup>th</sup> 1756</em><br />I left <a href="#mlpla000209.html">York</a> with my dear Father, and

         Choirhouse, for which I had no desire in any wise. <br /> But he having a mind to stay, we settled at <a href=".html">Lane end</a>, where I <br /> had many trials, and found I still had not
         attain'd to what my <br />Sav<sup>r</sup> had call'd me, which was the Choirhouse, I, my Saviour, his <br /> Salvation, Choirhouse and Congregation seem'd esentially inseparable <br /> to me,
         the foundation of which seem'd to be wrote in my heart<br /> with an eternal pen, for, surely, such realities are no where to be <br /> found but in the heart of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>, I
         had however much to learn, and <br /> for want of knowing myself rightly, saw many faults in others. <br /><sup>and together</sup> with my situation, and every thing about me, my Father also
         <br /> lay heavy on me, as he was the visible means of keeping me out <br /> of the Choirhouse, but in time he was dispos'd to be boarded <br /> at <a href=".html">Richard Mortimers</a> that
         I might be at Liberty, and I accom <br /> modated him there to his satisfaction. <em>Nov<sup>r</sup> 13<sup>th</sup> 1756</em>I was <br /> reciev'd into the Cong<sup>n</sup>. Ah! this was an
         inexpresible grace, <br /> this was the greatest solemnity I ever enjoy'd in all my Life. <br /><em>Sep<sup>r</sup> 7<sup>th</sup> 1757</em>, I remov'd into the Choirhouse, this was a new
         <br /> School to me, as I met with many things contrary to my way of <br /> thinking, which went so far that I wish'd to go away again, but <br /> I afterwards found that it all work'd for my
         good, and that I did <br /> not know myself sufficiently. <em>March 25<sup>th</sup> 1758</em> I had the grace</p>PAGE BREAK

            Holy Sacrament</sup> with then<br />Congregation, but was much perplex'd by depending so much on my <br /> own feelings, not knowing truely that the feeling void of good was <br /> well
         for me but on speaking with my Labouress, she directed me to <br /> our Saviour as a sinner, not as a holy pemelson, hereupon my depra- <br /> vity was so open'd to me, that I despair'd of
         ever being otherwise <br /> than a miserable creature, but when I cou'd fall as a sinner at the <br /> feet of our Saviour, his gracious absolution melted me, and enabled <br /> me to bear
         the reproach for my humiliation, and no more for my <br />condemnation, this great change was much more bless'd to me than <br /> the first forgivness of my sins, the <sup>grace &amp;

         cou'd turn to my beloved, and yet amidst all <br /> these great priviledges, I was always falling short and had daily <br /><sup>something new</sup> to experience, outwardly I had also many
         trials <br /> from not having been us'd to such accommodations as I met with <br /> here, but nothing brought me to the real sinner point before my <br />Saviour, till all other means of
         friendship fail'd; thus I had for <br /> almost 7 years a continual course of trials, till once for all He <br /> became the sole object of my heart, and I as nothing but a worm <br /> before
         him, then, and then only my course became truely and so- <br /> lidly a Heaven upon earth, my Saviour was at my right hand <br /> and at my left but lowliness and sinnerlikeness I was still
         short <br /> of, in which I believe I shall remain defective as long as my dear <br />Saviour continues me in this mortal frame. So far <sup>her</sup><del>our Late Sister</del><br /> own

      <p> It is evident that our late Sis<sup>r</sup> had a particular Call to the Cong<sup>n</sup><br /> which together <sup>with</sup> what her heart enjoy'd from our
            Sav<sup>r</sup> she knew how <br /> to value above every thing in this world, oftentimes declaring, and that <br /> with a heart deeply affected, what great things he had done for her,
         <br /> and how, even the trials she had met with had work'd together for her <br /> real good. She was a person truly devoted to Him, and thought it <br /> not too much to spend her time and
            <sup>little</sup> substance in his cause, to the <br />great relief of <sup>many of</sup> the inhabitants of the Choirhouse, who in the first Y<sup>rs</sup><br /> of its existence felt
         many straits, <sup>Having also a warmheart for our Savr. and being</sup> self endow'd with many <br /> extradinary Gifts, she knew how to give good advice in most circumstan- <br /> ces and
         in this respect gain'd much love and confidence from the S<sup>rs</sup><br /> in short, we cou'd say much of her faithfull service in our House <br /> and Choir ever since the Year
            <em>1757</em>, but as she frequently declar'd <br /> that neither her coming to the Cong<sup>n</sup>, nor her staying therein, was <br /> her own doings, but our Sav<sup>rs</sup> own free
         electing grace, <sup>and</sup> that she cou'd <br /> not possibly be happy in any other situation, so she likewise entreated <br /> that nothing she had done might in the least be attributed
         to her <br /> self, but solely and alone to His praise, who in his infinite mercy<br /> had brought her to such a blessed school for her own heart, and <br /> therefore it was her highest
         pleasure, cou'd she any way be serviceable <br /> to her Choir or the Cong<sup>n</sup>. For several Years last past her strength <br /> declin'd <del>very much</del><sup>fast</sup>, so that

            Sav<sup>r</sup> had shewn unto her, which now <br /> she beheld clearer than ever, the effect of which was, her heart <br /> became more and more sinnerlike, of which the following lines
