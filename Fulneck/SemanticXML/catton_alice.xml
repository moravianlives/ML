							<hi rend="underline">died Feb. / 48</hi> <lb />
							Our late Sr Alice Catton was <lb />
							bore at Hathwaite in Huddersf<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> in <lb />
							Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1767, her parents being in <lb />
							connection with the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> church &amp;
								mem <lb />
							bers of our Cog<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at Mifield who
								enjoyed <lb />
							the Grace of God in their hts. &amp; bro<hi rend="superscript"
									>t.</hi> up their <lb />
							childr<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> in the nuture &amp; admonit<hi
									rend="superscript">n</hi> of ye Ld so <lb />
							that our late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> knew the truth &amp;
								doubtless <lb />
							felt powerful drawings of divine lore from <lb />
							her early childhood. When ab<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> 16 yrs of
								age, <lb />
							she came to reside in it sisters house at <lb />
							that time existing at Littlemoor in the <lb />
							house now tenanted by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkinson
								While <lb />
							there she grew in grace &amp; in the knowledge <lb />
							of our Ld. &amp; Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jes. Christ, as her
								occasional <lb />
							references in conversation, to that period <lb />
							of her life, as a happy &amp; profitable one, proved. <lb />
							In the y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1783 the establishme<hi
									rend="superscript">t</hi> at Littlemoor <lb />
							being broken up, she removed with most of <lb />
							her companions to our Sisters house here <lb />
							having spent 8 years in the other institu- <lb />
							tion, &amp; having been, during that time, rec<hi rend="superscript"
									>d</hi> <lb />
							into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; admitted to the H.
									Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. She <lb />
							did not spend reside (in this Sisters&apos; house) for <lb />
							the whole of her remaining time, but lived <lb />
							some years with her late father, nursing him <lb />
							faithfully until his end, in her native place <lb />
							she was also a short time at Gumersal - lived with <lb />
							a friend in a private house in Fulneck <lb />
							&amp; likewise occupied another house by herself <lb />
							she was for sometime cook in the Sisters <lb />
							house, &amp; spent attasctory upwards of 50 <lb />
							years either in this or that at Littlemoor. <lb />
							The fact, that throughout the whole of her <lb />
							lengthened pilgrimmage of 4 score years she <lb />
							maintained a consistent Moravian character <lb />
							proves that she knew whom she believed, <lb />
							that her love of Moravians constrained her, &amp; that <lb />
							she walked humbly with her God. Tho&apos; not <lb />
							so communicative &amp; open as some followers <lb />
							of the Lamb on spiritual subjects, her

							&amp; tender, as well as her walk conformable to <lb />
							the gospel, showed that she was in Christ &amp; that <lb />
							his spirit dwelt in her. Being, moreover of <lb />
							a very cheerful, lively &amp; amiable disposition <lb />
							she was generally beloved &amp; respected wherever <lb />
							she dwelt &amp; by old &amp; young. Her course <lb />
							temporal &amp; spiritual, was remarkably <lb />
							smooth &amp; even; she had an excellent con- <lb />
							stitut<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; enjoyed very good health
								not <lb />
							feeling much even of the infirmities of <lb />
							old age &amp; being able often to attend the means <lb />
							of grace in which she delighted finding in <lb />
							these pastures for her soul. Nor had she <lb />
							many trials, of an external nature, to <lb />
							cope with; perhaps the heaviest was the loss <lb />
							of her little property by the failure of a <lb />
							bank in Halifax, at a time when such <lb />
							a calamity must be peculiarly dis <lb />
							tressing viz. where old-age was approaching <lb />
							yet she submitted, taking the dispensation <lb />
							as from the hands of the Lord, &amp; believing that <lb />
							he would know how to provide for her; nor <lb />
							was her confidence put to shame; he, who  <lb />
							clothes the lilies &amp; feeds the ravens, found <lb />
							her food &amp; raiment &amp; what adds so much <lb />
							to those blessings a contented &amp; cheerful mind <lb />
							until he took her to where the Lamb himself <lb />
							shall feed his sheep &amp; guide them to living <lb />
							fountains of water. She was attacked <lb />
							by the then prevailing influenza ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
								2 <lb />
							mo<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> ago, &amp; was so much reduced, that
								she <lb />
							quite expected to be called home to her <lb />
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>; she recovered, however, once more
								so <lb />
							for, as to have almost regained her wanted <lb />
							strength; but on Friday Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 20<hi
									rend="superscript">th</hi> she <lb />
							was taken ill of another complaint, which <lb />
							presently reduced her so rapidly, that no <lb />
							hopes could be entertained of her recovery.  <lb />
							Throughout the whole of her illness she was <lb />
							much pleased to enter into spiritual con- <lb />
							versat<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> with any spiritual believing
								friend, always <lb />
							welcomed her labourer &amp; her minister,  <lb />
							whom she had known from a little Boy, with <lb />
							joy &amp; affection &amp; loved to have a prayer offered.

							ed up at her side. When it became <lb />
							evident, that her days were numbered, &amp; <lb />
							she was asked, if she herself tho<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> our
									Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
							would at this time take her to himself, <lb />
							she said at first with the utmost calm- <lb />
							ness, &quot;It is not yet clear to me,&quot; but after <lb />
							a day or two, she said decidedly, &quot;I know <lb />
							not that I <hi rend="underline">am</hi> going,&quot; adding
								that she <lb />
							knew her Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, in whom she had so long
								be <lb />
							lieved, who had led her from her youth <lb />
							up &amp; shewn her never varying loving <lb />
							kindness, could now complete His work <lb />
							&amp; crown His Grace for that tho&apos; she was <lb />
							a poor worthless sinner in herself, He had <lb />
							washed her from sins in his own blood <lb />
							&amp; would, she assuredly believed, fully pre- <lb />
							pare her, by His spirit for entering into <lb />
							his kingdom &amp; seeing Him face to face. <lb />
							She spoke with true humility of herself <lb />
							as of one who had not a crumb of merit <lb />
							no, not <hi rend="underline">one</hi> righteous work to
								plead; <lb />
							but she extolled the all sufficiency, the <lb />
							grace, the tender loving kindness of her <lb />
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as her <hi rend="underline"
									>All</hi>. A friend observing to her <lb />
							one day in conversation, &quot;You have <lb />
							had a smooth &amp; even course thro&apos; time,&quot; <lb />
							she replied: &quot;Indeed I have, tho&apos; not quite <lb />
							without troubles, which we must all <lb />
							share, I have indeed been most justly <lb />
							led, even to heavy heirs. Her very looks <lb />
							beamed for the the calm serenity of her <lb />
							soul, &amp; whenever she was asked if <lb />
							she still felt our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> peace in her <lb />
							soul, &amp; felt her reply was an empha- <lb />
							tic &quot;Yes!&quot; she stated too, that no doubts <lb />
							or fears even of a transiently disturbed her <lb />
							peace &amp; joy in believing. Up to last sa- <lb />
							turday, tho&apos; occasionally rambling she <lb />
							was able to understand &amp; answer ques- <lb />
							tions, but on Lords day morning all con-

							sciousness seemed to be gone &amp; she <lb />
							lay perfectly quiet till ab<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> 6
								o&apos;clock <lb />
							in the evening when she breathed her <lb />
							last in the most gentle manner, &amp; <lb />
							without even a sigh, at the age of 80 <lb />
							years &amp; about 10 weeks. Thus her last <lb />
							end was peace, &amp; she sleeps in Jesus.
