					<l>Our late Sr Rachel Brook was </l>
					<l>born Apr. 28th 1744 at Birstol.</l>
					<l>Her Parents, who loved the Lord</l>
					<l>directed her from her earliest</l>
					<l>years to the friend of Children </l>
					<l>and took her, when a Child to the</l>
					<l>Chaple at Gumersal, where she at</l>
					<l>tended the Childrens meetings, and </l>
					<l>and used to be delighted to hear</l>
					<l>of our Saviours love, and when</l>
					<l>comming home she would some</l>
					<l>time kneel down in a corner</l>
					<l>and pray to him to bless her</l>
					<l>and form her to his mind.</l>
					<l>But When she grew older she found</l>
					<l>that tender Childlike love to our </l>
					<l>growing cold, she wished to injoy</l>
					<l>the world, and its vain pleasured,</l>
					<l>but always felt a monitor within,</l>
					<l>warning her from going the broad</l>
					<l>road, which leadeth to destruction;</l>
					<l>she spent some time in great</l>
				</lg>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>trouble of mind, not willing to</l>
					<l>follow the Lord, and full of fear</l>
					<l>to be last eternally; during this</l>
					<l>period, which was in her 16th</l>
					<l>year, she had a very remarkable</l>
					<l>dream: it was to her as if she </l>
					<l>saw our Saviour on the Cross, in</l>
					<l>the most lovely attitude, saying</l>
					<l>to her, &quot;all my sufferings, wounds</l>
					<l>and bruises were for thee, to</l>
					<l>save and redeem thy sinful soul.&quot;</l>
					<l>This made a deep impression on her</l>
					<l>mind, and she turned in earnest</l>
					<l>prayer to the Lord, that he would</l>
					<l>pardon her sins and transgressions</l>
					<l>and renew a right spirit within</l>
					<l>her, &amp; once when walking in a field</l>
					<l>by herself, with tears and prayer</l>
					<l>lifting up her hands to him, she</l>
					<l>got an assurance that her guilt</l>
					<l>should be done away, and that</l>
					<l>he would prove her good Shepherd</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>who seeks that which was lost</l>
					<l>with unwearied faithfulness.</l>
					<l>This has followed all her life and </l>
					<l>often thro&apos; grace been renewed.</l>
					<l>She now felt a desire to be closer</l>
					<l>united with the Brns Congn and </l>
					<l>to injoy the priviliges of the same.</l>
					<l>Oct 4th 1760 she moved into the</l>
					<l>Srs House here in Fulnek, May 11.</l>
					<l>1761 she was recd into the Brns Congn</l>
					<l>and May 8th the following year</l>
					<l>partook for the first time of</l>
					<l>the H. Comn. She often spoke</l>
					<l>with great pleasure, of the time</l>
					<l>of her first comming, how happy</l>
					<l>she was in communion with our</l>
					<l>Saviour, and how comfortable the</l>
					<l>Srs were together in the so called</l>
					<l>spinning days, and how they delighted</l>
					<l>midst great poverty in singing the</l>
					<l>praises of the Lord. She was</l>
					<l>soon impolyed in serving as an Over</l>
				</lg>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>seer with the Girls, and afterwards</l>
					<l>with Sisters. In 1790 she was accepted </l>
					<l>atcoluth, and for 18 years she held</l>
					<l>the Office of Houseservant, she </l>
					<l>showed much faithfulness in what</l>
					<l>was committed to her, and looked</l>
					<l>opon it as a favour, which</l>
					<l>made her Office a pleasant duty.</l>
					<l>to her. The last few years, she</l>
					<l>was not able to do as formerly</l>
					<l>but injoying the love of the Srs</l>
					<l>they were willing to lend her a</l>
					<l>helping hand whenever required,</l>
					<l>particularly those Srs in her room</l>
					<l>showed her much love &amp; attention.</l>
					<l>Tho&apos; nothing very striking seemed to</l>
					<l>distinguish her course, we are sure</l>
					<l>that she lived in communion with</l>
					<l>our Saviour, and with Childlike</l>
					<l>confidence and humble faith looked</l>
					<l>to him for help and support in</l>
					<l>every time of need. </l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Oct 4th 1810 she called to mind that</l>
					<l>it was 50 years since she moved</l>
					<l>into this house, she expressed</l>
					<l>herself that she could not suffi</l>
					<l>ciently thank our Saviour, for all</l>
					<l>his love and care, his longsuffering</l>
					<l>and forbearance, and for all his </l>
					<l>mercy towards her, and looked back</l>
					<l>with gratitude and amazement how</l>
					<l>he had proved her true friends in</l>
					<l>all her spiritual and temporal</l>
					<l>concerns, that she had laked</l>
					<l>nothing; and she renewed her </l>
					<l>convenant to cleave to him, to </l>
					<l>trust his Shepherd care, till</l>
					<l>hope and faith shall cease, and</l>
					<l>Love prevail alone.</l>
					<l>Hitherto she had injoyed an unin</l>
					<l>terrupted good stale of health, but</l>
					<l>now she began to feel the infir</l>
					<l>mities of age, and for these last 3</l>
					<l>years, she was not able to attend </l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb xml:id='IMG_1166.jpg' n='4'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>the meetings as she used to do,</l>
					<l>which was a great trial to her.</l>
					<l>She was however able to go about</l>
					<l>in the house, tho&apos; at last with</l>
					<l>great difficulty, till the 6th</l>
					<l>of this month, when she had to </l>
					<l>be confined to the sickroom, her</l>
					<l>weakness increased rapidly; tho&apos;</l>
					<l>she did not think that her de</l>
					<l>parture was so near, she felt</l>
					<l>resigned to our Saviours will,</l>
					<l>saying: &quot;My times are in his hands</l>
					<l>I can say do nothing but pray</l>
					<l>to him to receive me, a poor</l>
					<l>and worthless sinner, in mercy,</l>
					<l>and I am sure he will.&quot; -</l>
					<l>On the 13th she called to mind the</l>
					<l>blessings she had often enjoyed on</l>
					<l>that great memorial day, and </l>
					<l>particularly what she had felt the</l>
					<l>first time, when she celebrated it</l>
					<l>55 years ago, during the singing of</l>
					<l>that verse:</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>O Church, how many hast thou yet</l>
					<l>Who do not love the Saviour?</l>
					<l>Who do not think his burden light</l>
					<l>Nor his sweet Yoke a favour!</l>
					<l>O ye, who don&apos;t stand well with him,</l>
					<l>Do ye long for redemption?</l>
					<l>Now, now, is for you the right time</l>
					<l>Come all without exception.</l>
					<l>She spent the following days mostly</l>
					<l>in a slumber, and when she awoke</l>
					<l>between, she only complained on </l>
					<l>great weakness, she often folded</l>
					<l>her hands, as being ingaged in</l>
					<l>prayers, when the lipps no more</l>
					<l>could say; and on the 16th it </l>
					<l>pleased the Lord to call her to </l>
					<l>himself in a gentle and happy</l>
					<l>manner. Aged 71. 6 1/2 Month.</l>
					<l>Among the saints in light;</l>
					<l>Behold our Sister seated:</l>
					<l>Her faith now lost in sight</l>
					<l>Her happiness compleated: </l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb xml:id='IMG_1167.jpg' n='5'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>With cheerful voice she joins</l>
					<l>The blessed company,</l>
					<l>Ascribing to Gods&apos; grace</l>
					<l>Her heav&apos;nly destiny.</l>
					<l>At home she rests in peace</l>
					<l>With her beloved Saviour,</l>
					<l>All her afflictions cease,</l>
					<l>Each tear wip&apos;d off for ever:</l>
					<l>Her longing gratify&apos;d</l>
					<l>She views her Bridegroom, Friend:</l>
					<l>Who graciously supplied,</l>
					<l>Each need unto the end. </l>
