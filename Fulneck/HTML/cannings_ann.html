      <h2>Ann Cannings</h2>
      <p> The S. S<sup>r</sup><a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000226.html">Ann Cannings</a> was born
         <br/><em>July 24<sup>th</sup> 1790</em> at <a href="#mlpla000059.html">Mirfield</a> and by <br/> attending the <a href=".html">B<sup>rns</sup> Chaple</a> in her <br/> childhood,
         						received an impression of the
         <br/>
         love of <a href=".html">Jesus</a> into her heart and became <br/>attached to the
         						privileges of the Cong<sup>n</sup><br/>
         into which she was rec'<sup>d</sup> <em>March 9<sup>th</sup>
            							1805</em><br/>Two years after she was rec'd moved in
         <br/>
         to the <a href="#mlpla000267.html">S. S<sup>rs</sup> House in Gummersal</a>, and <br/><em>Jan 25<sup>th</sup> 1808</em>
         						partook of the H. Com<sup>n</sup><br/> for the first time, her fellowship <br/> with a Cong<sup>n</sup> of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>,
         						was much <br/>vallued by her, as her frequent impres- <br/> sions
         						testified. She spent several years <br/> in a happy frame of mind at <a href="#mlpla000041.html">Gummersal</a><br/> but after some time a some of the <br/> depravity of her nature aimed
         						to</p>
      <p><br/> disturb her simple and childlike
         <br/>
         confidence in our Saviour. <em>May
            								4<sup>th</sup><br/> 1811</em>she moved into the <a href=".html">Choirhouse</a> here<br/> and by her pleasing behaviour soon <br/> gained the love of the
         							Sisters But <br/> still she
         						often complained of not </p>
   	
   	
   	
   	
      <p>enjoying that happiness which she felt <br/> when first impressed with our Saviours<br/>Love. Some time ago, a friend of hers <br/> found the following verses
         						written by <br/> by her; "A whither should I go, burdened<br/> and sick and
         						faint? &amp; What is it keeps <br/> me back, from which I cannot part?"
         						<br/> &amp; This gave rise to a conversation in which <br/>she complained with many tears of
         <br/>
         the state of her heart,
         						and confessed <br/> that she was engaged with thoughts <br/> and actions
         						contrary to the mind of <br/> the Lord. She was then directed with <br/> all her ailments to
         							<a href=".html">Jesus</a> the good <br/>Physicion, sought his
         						pardning grace<br/> and obtained a reviving sence of his
         <br/>
         mercy. The
         						celebration of the Passion <br/> week this year was remarkably blessed<br/>
         						to her, and she expressed herself concern- <br/>ing it, to the following
         						effect: <br/> "Oh how shall I describe my feelings, <br/> the Power of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>
         						blood and death <br/>pervaded my soul in a manner, which </p>
      <p> I shall never forget, in his pierced hands <br/> I read my pardon seated, he is mine <br/>
         						and I am his, oh might nothing ever <br/> separate me from him!"-- She was <br/> naturally of a weakly constitution, and
         							<br/> therefore often thought, that her pil- <br/>grimage on earth might
         							not be long. <br/> In the <em>latter end of May
            							last</em> she was <br/> obliged to move into the sickroom, and <br/>
         						growing no better, went to her parents  <br/>house to <a href="#mlpla000041.html">Mirfield</a> to be nursed by them. <br/> Her complaint
         						appeared consumptive, <br/>
         						she grew rapidly worse, and tho' she <br/> did not immidiately suppose her
         						de- <br/> parture to be so near at hand, felt
         <br/>
         soon resigned to our
         							Saviours will <br/> declared that
         						thro' the merits of <br/> Jesus, her mind was at peace, begged <br/> her
         						parents not to grieve, and had a <br/>lively hope of appearing in our
         							Saviours<br/> presence, as a pardened sinner, This
         <br/>
         favour was granted to her<em>Sept 3<sup>d</sup> 1813</em><br/> in the 24<sup>th</sup> year of her age. </p></body>
