						which was in her <date when-iso="1760" cert="medium">16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year</date>, she had a very remarkable dream: it was to her as if she saw our <roleName
							type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> on the Cross, in the most lovely attitude, saying to her, &quot;all my sufferings, wounds and bruises were for thee, to save and redeem
						thy sinful soul.&quot; This made a deep impression on her mind, and she turned in earnest prayer to the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>, that he would pardon her
						sins and transgressions and renew a right spirit within her, &amp; once when walking in a field by herself, with <name type="emotion">tears and prayer lifting up her hands to

					<p> On the <date when-iso="1815-11-13">13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></date> she called to mind the blessings she had often enjoyed on that great memorial day, and particularly
