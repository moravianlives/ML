      <h2>Anna Rosina Anderson</h2>
      <p>Our dear happily departed Sister<br></br><a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000215.html">Anna
            								Rosina Anderson</a>, has left <br></br>the following account of herself:<br></br> I was born the <em>9<sup>th</sup> of Aug 1727</em> at <br></br><a href="#mlpla000026.html">Berthelsdorf</a>. My Parents belonging to <br></br> the Cong<sup>n</sup> endeavour'd to bring me up <br></br> in the same connection with the Cong<sup>n</sup><br></br>&amp; sent me from my earliest years every <br></br> Sunday to <a href="#mlpla000001.html">Herrnhut</a> to the Childrens <br></br> meeting,
         						which the late <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000566.html">Count Zinzendorf</a><br></br> kept. He asked me many questions, and <br></br> tho' I did not always understand him, <br></br> yet it made an impression on my heart <br></br> and I felt a desire to be happy. When <br></br> I was in my <em>7<sup>th</sup>
            							year</em> my Father de- <br></br> parted happily to our Savior, after <br></br> which the late <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000566.html">Count</a> took care of my <br></br> Mother &amp; her children; she came to <br></br> live in the <a href=".html">widows house</a> at <a href="#mlpla000001.html">Herrnhut</a></p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> and her children in the <a href=".html">Orphan house</a>, <br></br> but I for my part had no inclination <br></br> for it, but chose to stay with my Grand <br></br> father in
         							<a href="#mlpla000026.html">Berthelsdorf</a>. After a few years <br></br> my Uncle in <a href="#mlpla000053.html">Lobenstein</a> desired me to <br></br> come
         						and live with him, which I <br></br> was very glad of. I was there above a <br></br> year, but did not find it so agreeable<br></br> as I thought, and I prayed may times <br></br> with tears to the Lord, to help me away <br></br> again,
         						which he graciously did. For it <br></br> happened at this time that the late <br></br><a href="#mlper000538.html">Count</a> came to <a href="#mlpla000036.html">Ebbersdorf</a> and my Uncle <br></br> had an oppertunity to see him; and <br></br> told
         						him that I was very unhap <br></br> py here; on hearing this he took me <br></br> under his care, &amp; sent me to
         								<a href="#mlpla000269.html">Marienborn <br></br> to the Orphan house</a>; I prayed to the <br></br>
         							Lord to preserve me here &amp; make me <br></br>happy, &amp; that I never might come to </p>
      <p> any other place except among the Brethren, <br></br> because I was sometimes enticed by my <br></br> Uncle to go back with him to his home. <br></br> At that time
         						during a severe sickness<br></br> which I got, I learned to pray earnestly<br></br> for my happiness. I found many friends <br></br> here who wish'd me well and to see me pros <br></br> per for
         						our Savior; particularly one Sister<br></br> will always be remember'd by me, who, <br></br> when I had recovered, took me with <br></br> her into the garden, and kneeling down <br></br> with me, put up a fervent prayer in <br></br> my behalf to our Savior, which I shall <br></br> never forget. But it was not
         						sufficient to <br></br> make me happy; because I must feel <br></br>my Saviorscomfort &amp; forgivenessfor my <br></br> own heart, &amp; this happened in a very <br></br> particular manner. Being once quite <br></br> alone
         							in a place I fell down at his feet <br></br> &amp; implored his mercy &amp; forgiveness for all <br></br> my sins
         							thro' his precious blood. At <br></br> that time I felt something, which I <br></br> cannot express, his comfort to my troub <br></br> led soul and his mercy shown to me, </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p>melted my heart in thousand tears. In <em>1740</em><br></br> I was after the then usual manner <sup>received</sup> into the <br></br>Childrens Cong<sup>n</sup> which proved a great bles <br></br> sing to me, I devoted my heart to our Savior<br></br> to live to him &amp; serve him; however after <br></br> wards, I must own, I had many things to <br></br> experience by which I learnt better to know <br></br> myself but our
         							Savior was faithful and <br></br> helped me thro', I always felt freedom to <br></br> speak my mind openhartedly to my Labouress <br></br> which was a great help to me. In the year <br></br><em>1741</em>I was received into the great girls Choir<br></br> and in the <em>same year</em> I enjoyed the holy <br></br> Com<sup>n</sup> for the first time, which was <br></br> an unspeakable blessingto my heart. At <br></br> that time there was a company of great <br></br> girls which the late <a href=".html">Count</a> took par- <br></br> ticular
         						care of, he kept us Choir meetings <br></br> and instructed us how to become useful <br></br> in our Saviors service. I was appoin- <br></br> ted
         						to keep the Childrens &amp; great girls <br></br> bands, and enjoyedmany blessings from <br></br>our Savior, when we spoke together of <br></br> his great love &amp; mercy.
         						Soon after <br></br> I had the office of an assistant among </p>
      <p> the Children conferred upon me and <br></br>moved in the same year with this Oec <br></br> onomy to <a href="#mlpla000014.html">Herrnhag</a>.
         						All these appoint <br></br> ments taught me to come into closer <br></br> connection with our Savior and showed <br></br> me that I could do
         						nothing of myself. <br></br> His mercy and love shown to me bowed <br></br> me in the dust before him. I had the <br></br>confidence to cleave to him as a poor <br></br> sinner, &amp; believed he would help me <br></br> thro'. <em>1743</em>I was accepted an Acoluth<br></br> with a large company, which encou <br></br> rag'd me anew to live to him and <br></br> serve him as a poor Child that has <br></br> nothing to plead but his mercy from <br></br> day to day. <em>1744</em>I was receiv'd <br></br> into the S. S<sup>rs</sup> Choir and <em>1747</em><br></br>blessed for a Deaconess. <em>1748</em> I received <br></br> a Call to be
         							S. S<sup>rs</sup> Labores at <a href="#mlpla000002.html">Beth <br></br> lehem in America</a>. In
         							<a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a><em>Feb<sup>r</sup>. <br></br> the 10<sup>th</sup></em>I was bless for my office &amp; <br></br> set out in June. Sept the 20<sup>th</sup> I <br></br> arrived in <a href="#mlpla000002.html">Bethlehem</a> after a trouble<br></br>some voyage. I cannot but take no- <br></br> tice, that this year the <em>13<sup>th</sup> of
            							Nov.</em><br></br> was celebrated the first time in </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p><a href="#mlpla000070.html">America</a>, which brought the first impres- <br></br> sion of that in <a href="#mlpla000014.html">Herrnhaag</a><em>1741</em> very <br></br> fresh to my mind, but I was sorry, <br></br> I could not enjoy it in such a
         							<del>moment</del><br></br> manner as I wish'd to do. I had to <br></br> struggle, particularly in the beginning <br></br> with many difficulties, being young <br></br> and
         						unexperienced, and had no body <br></br> to whom I could open my heart and <br></br> consult with, so as I wish'd;
         						which <br></br> made it sometimes very heavy to me. <br></br> But my dear Savior helped me thro' <br></br>
         						whenever I turn'd to him in my dis- <br></br> tress. I visited frequently in the most <br></br> of the country Cong<sup>ns</sup> which lay very <br></br> distant from each other. In the year <br></br><em>1755</em> a a war broke out between the <br></br> French &amp; English, and as the Indi- <br></br> ans generally took share and joined <br></br> one of the other
         						party, we had very <br></br> difficult times at <a href="#mlpla000002.html">Bethlehem</a> and <br></br><a href="#mlpla000020.html">Nazareth</a>. First <a href="#mlpla000079.html">the settlement of <br></br> the Brethren at the Mahony</a> about </p>
      <p> 27 miles from <a href="#mlpla000002.html">Bethlehem</a> was destroyed <br></br> by the Indians, where 11 B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; S<sup>rs</sup> lost <br></br> their lives, after which many mur- <br></br> ders were committed
         						much nearer, till <br></br> at last within 6 miles of <a href="#mlpla000002.html">Bethle- <br></br> hem</a>. We knew that we were closely <br></br> watched by the Indians, who
         						would <br></br>gladly have destroyed the Place, which <br></br> at that time was the only one capable <br></br> of making any resistance to their <br></br> Incursion. The
         						reports of their cru- <br></br> elties at other places kept us in con <br></br> tinual allarm and apprehension,
         						<br></br> particularly as Indians were some <br></br> times observed to lurk about and <br></br> in the place at nights.</p>
      <p> However the strict watch kept by <br></br> the B<sup>rn</sup> in many parts &amp; particu- <br></br> larly about our house, but above all <br></br>
         						the protection of our good Lord, al- <br></br> ways frustrated their designs. <br></br> During all these heavy times, our dear Lord<br></br> was our only comfort and his peace</p>PAGE BREAK
      <p>was very sensibly felt amongst us. In the <br></br> year <em>1762</em><a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Nathanael Seidel</a> arrived <br></br> here from <a href="#mlpla000075.html">Europe</a>, who had lately been <br></br> married to S<sup>r</sup> <a href=".html">Anne Joh. Piesch</a> an old
         						<br></br> acquaintance of mine; from whose conver <br></br> sation and support I received much com <br></br> fort. In the year <em>1764</em> I received a call <br></br> to return to <a href="#mlpla000075.html">Europe</a>, <a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup> Susanna de <br></br> Gersdorf</a> arrived early in <em>that year</em> to <br></br> supply my place, and I left <a href="#mlpla000002.html">Bethle <br></br> hem</a> in company with <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup></a> &amp; <a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup> Bochler</a><br></br> and some other B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; S<sup>rs</sup> in the begin <br></br> ning of May.
         							We had a very quick passage, arrived in <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a><em>the 24<sup>th</sup><br></br> of June</em>, &amp; at <a href="#mlpla000001.html"><a href="#mlpla000057.html">Marienborn</a></a> where the <br></br>Synod was assembled on the <em>4<sup>th</sup> of <br></br> July</em>. After the
         								Synod was closed I <br></br> went to <a href="#mlpla000001.html">Herrnhut</a> and in the year <em>1765</em><br></br> received a Call to serve the S. S<sup>rs</sup> Choirs<br></br> in <a href="#mlpla000072.html">England</a>. I first went to <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, <br></br> where I staid about a year, &amp; then got <br></br> a Call to <a href="#mlpla000025.html">Bedford</a>, where I served the <br></br>single S<sup>rs</sup> untill the year <em>1772</em> when I return'd again to <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>. To go <br></br> any farther in
         						relating my course I <br></br> don't think needful. Our Saviorspas- <br></br> sion and death and that he has redee- <br></br> med me poor Sinner with his own pre- <br></br> cious blood, is to me above everything
         						<br></br> in time and in eternity. He has helped <br></br> me thro' this vale of tears and given <br></br> me grace to
         						place my confidence in <br></br> him in which I never have been put <br></br> to shame. When I have the
         						favour <br></br> to see him face to face I shall kiss <br></br> his feet with Sinner-tears for all <br></br> his mercy bestowed upon me.</p>
      <p> Thus far has this faithful hand- <br></br> maid of <a href=".html">Jesus</a> left us an account of <br></br> herself and of <del>that</del> what the Lord<br></br> has done for her Soul. There would <br></br> be much to say of all the proofs of <br></br>grace; wherewith he has crowned her <br></br> endeavours and blessed her services to so <br></br> many souls, in advising,
         							comforting<br></br> and shewing them the way to true hap</p>PAGE BREAK
      <p>piness; but we shall content ourselves with <br></br> rendering unto him, who is the giver of all <br></br> good gifts, our humble thanks and prai- <br></br> ses for all the mercys bestowed upon her, <br></br> during her
         						pilgrimage here below. Her <br></br> character and the blessing which attented <br></br> her Labour is known and acknowledged <br></br> with thankfulness and we heartilywish<br></br> and pray that we may follow her foot- <br></br> steps. In the year <em>1772</em> when she the <br></br> second time arrived in <a href="mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, the <br></br>S. S<sup>rs</sup> Choir and Oeconomies in <a href="mlpla000084.html">Yorkshire</a><br></br> were in a very hopeful state and she <br></br> was recieved by them with much love<br></br> and affection. In this vineyard of the <br></br>Lord she laboured with the utmost <br></br> alacrity both of body &amp; mind, deeming <br></br> it her
         						highest priviledge to win Souls for <br></br> Christ. The weakest of the flock were <br></br> always objects of her peculiar care and <br></br>concern, and she spared no pains what- <br></br> ever in tending and bearing them in love;
         						<br></br> and in such instances when all means </p>
      <p> proved ineffectual, it was evident to all around <br></br> her, how she always bemoaned their loss. <br></br> On the other hand our Savior gave her the <br></br>satisfaction to see many faithful hand <br></br> maids, whom she had trained up for the <br></br> Lord,
         						enter into the different services of his <br></br> house, which she always looked upon as <br></br> the greatest favour conferred on herself. As <br></br>the Choir here in <a href="mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a> considerably in <br></br> creased, it was in the year <em>1780</em> taken
         						into <br></br> consideration to build a S. S<sup>rs</sup> house in <a href=".html">Wyke</a>, <br></br> and the proposal having been approved of, <br></br> our late
         							Sister had the pleasure to assist <br></br> in laying the foundation stone, which <br></br> was a blessedsolemnity. When it was fi <br></br> nished and inhabited by Sisters from <br></br><a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a> she used to visit them frequent <br></br> ly with great faithfulnes, and took <br></br> particular share in their weal &amp; woe; <br></br> as also in the wellfare of the Sisters <br></br> Oeconomies at <a href="#mlpla000041.html">Gummersall</a>, <a href="#mlpla000059.html">Mirfield</a><br></br> and <a href="#mlpla000052.html">Littlemore</a>; when several years <br></br> ago the latter was given up, it was a <br></br>great concern to her mind. </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> Of late years she grew weak and could <br></br> not be so active in her office as she <br></br>wished, nevertheless her mind was continu <br></br> ally employed for the wellfare of her <br></br>Choir. Great as her delight had been in the <br></br> beginning, to see her Choir in such an in- <br></br> creasing and florishing way, so great <br></br> was her concern of late years to see it <br></br>
         						gradually declining in number and but <br></br> few new ones coming in. So much the <br></br> more she wished and prayed that the <br></br> few remaining
         						might truly value their <br></br> lot of grace and enjoy the blessings &amp; <br></br>
         						privileges, which were so precious to <br></br> herself. For as to her own person she <br></br>regretted exceedingly, that in her latter <br></br> days old age &amp; weakness prevented <br></br> her attending every opportunity for
         						<br></br> edification &amp; encouragement as much <br></br> as she wished to do. <em>May the 1st <br></br> 1802</em> she was
         							seized with a paralytic <br></br> stroke, but recovered so far again
         						that she <br></br> on the <em>4th of May</em> could attend the meetings </p>
      <p> house. During this winter, her <br></br> weakness increased, &amp; she was much confined <br></br> room. <em>Febr. 15<sup>th</sup> 1803</em>, she had <br></br> her stroke, which quite took away <br></br>
         						use of her right side, &amp; the next day <br></br>she had strong convulsions so that we <br></br> expected her dissolution. She had <br></br> often expressed a wish for <a href=".html">B. Benade</a> to <br></br> pray with her at her departure which <br></br> was now done, and after the prayer <br></br> the blessing of the Lord was pronoun <br></br> ced over her. The feeling of
         							the peace<br></br> of <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q190.html">God</a> on this occasion will leave a <br></br> deep impression on the minds
         						of all <br></br><del>them</del> who were present. After the <br></br>first paroxysm she fell asleep and <br></br> slumbered for the the most part; but when <br></br> she between times awoke she seemed <br></br> to be sensible,
         						tho' her speech was so <br></br> far gone, that she could only say yes <br></br> or no to the questions asked. The <em>18<sup>th</sup></em><br></br> some Sisters assembled in her room to <br></br> sing some verses expressing our fore <br></br> taste of that happy lot to be at home </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> with the Lord; she seemed quite de- <br></br> lighted with it and kept awake the <br></br> whole time. The
         							<em>19<sup>th</sup></em> in the afternoon <br></br> she appeared more recollected than before <br></br> and could speak several words,
         						and when <br></br> the girls came to see her, she gave them all <br></br> the hand &amp; said: The Lord bless you! <br></br> Afterwards she slumber'd again
         						till <br></br> about evening, had a very restless night, <br></br> and the <em>20<sup>th</sup></em> in
         						the morning about 7 <br></br> a' clock her redeemed and thro' the blood <br></br> of Jesus sanctified soul went gently <br></br> and happy over into the
         						arms of her <br></br>b beloved bridegroom, during the singing <br></br> of that verse: When in the arms of <br></br> Jesus, thy lips shall pallid
         						grow.</p>
      <p> Her age was 75 years 6 months. </p>PAGE BREAK</body>
