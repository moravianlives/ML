							Memoir of the Life of our late venerable &amp; 
							happily departed Br Peter Jacob Planta, who 
							entered into joy of his Lord, at <placeName ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ockbrook" key="Ockbrook" cert="high">Ockbrook</placeName>, 
							<date when="1815-05-06" cert="high">May the 6th 1815</date>, in the 94th year of 
							his age, written by himself.
							I was born at Jonkioping a town in
							Sweden, Dec.r the 5th, old stile in the
							year 1721. My Father's name was Jacob
							Planta &amp; my Mother's maiden name
							Martha Ruda. They were both of the
							Lutheran Religion. I had two sisters,
							the elder was born during my Mother's
							marriage to her first husband, whose
							name was Peter Hilling. Our Parents
							spared no pains in giving us a religious
							&amp; genteel education; we had morning
							&amp; evening prayers in the family, to
							which the servants were also admitted.
							My dear Mother would often read in
							the bible, &amp; after prayers, used to re
							late to us pleasing scriptural his
							tories, especially such as had a reference
							to the life, sufferings &amp; death of our
							dear Lord &amp; Saviour, &amp; also his conversations

							with his disciples &amp; some of the persecut
							tions which the latter had to endure for
							his sake. On such occasions I used to
							sit on her lap, &amp; sometimes asked what
							reward the disciples had for their faithful
							ness to our Saviour: to which she replied:
							"They are richly rewarded for they are now
							exceeding happy with Him in his heavenly
							kingdom, singing his praises, &amp; adoring
							him for ever! I said with tears, O my
							dear Mamma, I wish that I had lived at
							the time our Saviour was upon earth,
							I also would have served him &amp; suffered
							for his sake. My Mother replied weeping,
							my dear child, if you had lived at that
							time you might perhaps have been of
							the number of those who cried out, cru
							cify him! crucify him! I said, O no, I never
							would, but I should have loved him dearly.
							She then blessed me, &amp; prayed the Lord to
							keep me as his property, &amp; to preserve
							me throughout my future life from sin,
							&amp; the seductions of this evil world, until
							I should be with him in his heavenly
							kingdom, &amp; then added that all those who
							loved &amp; served him here, would share
							in the same blessings which his disciples
							did. - This made a deep impression on my
							mind, &amp; was the first time when I

							but to have felt a real &amp; tender love &amp;
							attachment in my heart to our dear Saviour,
							&amp; in the sequel I always wished &amp; prayed that I
							might become &amp; remain a true child of
							God. When I was about 4 years of age,
							I experienced a remarkable preservation
							of my life. Having ran out of the house
							unobserved, with a spoon in my hand, I
							came to Lake Wetter, which was not
							far distant from our house, &amp; there
							being a broad plank laid over the water,
							I got to the end of it, &amp; was sitting on
							it, playing with the water, &amp; throwing
							it up with the spoon, admiring the 
							drops which appeared to me like pearls.
							A woman who came to fetch water, called
							out to me to take care that I did not fall
							into the water, to whom I replied: I will
							not fall in, but she had scarcely returned
							to her house before she thought that she
							heard a plunge in the water, upon
							which she set down her pail, &amp; ran
							towards the lake. Perceiving me in
							the water, she ventured in, &amp; with difficul
							ty caught hold of me by the hair of my
							head, &amp; drawing me out, she laid me
							across the plank, believing me to be
							dead. She then carried me home to my
							Parents, who, with the whole family were

							greatly alarmed, &amp; exceeding distressed, as they
							could perceived no signs of life in me. I
							was however put into a warm bed, &amp; after
							some time, while they were lamenting over
							me, I came to myself &amp; said dear Mamma
							don't cry for me, I am here, &amp; to the great
							joy of the whole family I recovered. As
							I increased in years, I experienced several
							preservations of my life, having been
							in danger of losing it, both by fire &amp; water
							&amp; once escaped being murdered. My Parents
							being desirous to give me a good education,
							procured a private Tutor in the house,
							until I went to a large school, in which
							I continued till my Father's happy depar
							ture, which took place in my 10th year.
							My Mother's intention was that I should
							continue my studies, wishing me to be
							a Minister of the Gospel, which also accord
							ed with my inclination. However a
							Relation persuaded my Mother to put
							me apprentice to an eminent Surgeon
							&amp; Apothecary in Gothenburg. Here I had
							a favorable opportunity to learn Pharmacy
							&amp; Chemistry, &amp; as my master had very
							extensive practice, &amp; employed me to
							visit his patients, I gradually began
							to practice myself. &amp; gave considerable
							satisfaction to my employer.

							my lost condition, I was for several years
							much concerned for my salvation, yea I may
							say ever since I was a child, the Holy Ghost
							carried on his work in my heart, by which 
							I was prevented from many sinful things, altho'
							I did frequently fall into sin, repenting &amp; sinning
							alternately, so that when I would do good, evil
							was present with me. I felt frequently a
							great desire to separate myself from the
							world, &amp; used to walk in the fields, where I
							could be alone, praying to our dear Saviour,
							in which I took great delight. At such
							times I felt much pleasure in singing,
							praises &amp; thanksgiving God; &amp; nothing
							afforded me greater joy, than to thank our
							Saviour for the many preservations I had
							experienced from him, when in danger of
							my life. However I also, alas! often forgot
							myself, &amp; gave way to levity when play
							ing with my companions. But the good
							spirit of God frequently reminded me 
							to seek the One thing needful. I felt a
							strong desire to be a child of God, &amp;
							when I was invited with my Parents
							to entertainments, at which was music
							&amp; dancing, I felt afterwards, great un
							easiness, &amp;, like one who is sick, not
							understanding properly the accusations
							of my conscience. When I was about 13
							years of age I had a great desire to 
							enjoy the Holy Comn, for which purpose

							I underwent an examination, &amp; was encouraged
							to partake. The first time I had the favor to
							approach the table of the Lord, it was with
							fear &amp; trembling, lest I should receive it
							unworthily, but at the enjoyment of this divine
							repast, I felt exceedingly happy, yea more
							so than I can express. In the sequel, whilst
							the Holy Ghost was operating upon my heart,
							I frequently examined myself, fearing I was
							not yet a child of God, &amp; yet earnestly
							desiring to be one. Such was the state of
							my mind when I came to Gothenburg. I
							experienced, at first much attention from the
							family in which I resided as an Apprentice, so
							long as I conformed to every thing in it. How
							ever the great concern I had for my salvation
							&amp; the thought of not being a child of God, gave
							me much uneasiness. I was always glad
							whenever I could be alone, &amp; pour out the desire
							of my heart before God, &amp; frequently prayed
							in stillness to him. I also resolved to with
							draw from all worldly amusements &amp; to
							spend the little time I had to myself, in
							spiritual exercises, longing to be assured that
							I was a child of God. Sometimes I
							arose in cold frosty nights, prostrating
							myself before God, &amp; praying most fer
							vently unto him, but it afforded me
							no relief. I thought then that my
							sorrow for my sins was not yet great

							I followed his advice &amp; found comfort. Feeling
