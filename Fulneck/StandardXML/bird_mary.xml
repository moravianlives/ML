						<lb/>Memmoir of the very happily
						<lb/>departed Sister Mary Bird
						<lb/>She was born Dec 1. 1754 at Bath
						<lb/>of Parents who educated her with great
						<lb/>moral rectitude in the principles
						<lb/>of the Establish'd Church and was
						<lb/>from early youth the subject
						<lb/>of very serious questions.
						<lb/>After the death of her esteem'd
						<lb/>Father, she was plac'd at a Board
						<lb/>ing School in Bristol, where she
						<lb/>was instructed in the usual
						<lb/>Female accomplishments and
						<lb/>also French, Music, &amp; Dancing
						<lb/>which she learned with avidity
						<lb/>but whilst the Master was in
						<lb/>structing her in the latter she
						<lb/>was inwardly impressd with a
						<lb/>voice within her heart saying
						<lb/>if you die this Night you will
						<lb/>go to Hell. This and other</p>

						<lb/>convictions so drew off her attention
						<lb/>from all Worldly amuse
						<lb/>ments that she soon forgot all the
						<lb/>songs she used to sing and often
						<lb/>sought retirement where she
						<lb/>may seek the Lord unobserved by
						<lb/>her Confessions they were more
						<lb/>suprized at her geat Change of Conduct
						<lb/>and sentiment, which some of
						<lb/>them chose to ridicule. But our
						<lb/>Saviour who began this good work
						<lb/>of grace in her soul remanded by
						<lb/>by sermons or one ????
						<lb/>in she mend kindly drew near
						<lb/>when one day she was medite
						<lb/>ing in loneliness and suffered
						<lb/>those words of Isiah 60.1
						<lb/>Arise Shine, for thy light is
						<lb/>come &amp; the glory of the Lord is risen
						<lb/>upon thee. most favorable to her
						<lb/>This enabled her to proceed with</p>
					<cb/>
					<p>
						<lb/>comfort &amp; fresh courage the ????
						<lb/>way: the Gospel was not preach'd in
						<lb/>such delightfull abundance as
						<lb/>at present in the Churches
						<lb/>of Bristol, yet in the name
						<lb/>of Jesus was only sometimes mention'd
						<lb/>in a sermon. it was delightfull
						<lb/>to her Ear, a very short time
						<lb/>after her Change of Heart, When
						<lb/>preparing to go and to visit a Friend
						<lb/>she was suddenly seized with
						<lb/>an attack of Rheumatick Gout
						<lb/>in her Stomach &amp; Limbs which
						<lb/>seldom altogether left her yet
						<lb/>the rich promises mention'd
						<lb/>in the holy Scriptures were by
						<lb/>the Holy Spirits teaching made
						<lb/>such sweet pasture to her Soul
						<lb/>that they yeilded her daily
						<lb/>Consolation and Instruction, She
						<lb/>was particularly fond of reading
						<lb/>works of ????? and ????
						<lb/>especialy Ecclesiastical by which
						<lb/>her mind became well in sound</p>

						<lb/>and her Opinions fix'd by matter
						<lb/>of fact. Being returned from
						<lb/>Bristol home to her mother, she
						<lb/>constantly enjoy'd the blessing
						<lb/>of evengelical preaching, and was
						<lb/>for many years and attendant
						<lb/>to Lady Huntingdon Chappel where
						<lb/>she partook of the Sacrament.
						<lb/>She married at the age of 23 and had
						<lb/>five Children four of whom have
						<lb/>preceeded her into a Blissfull
						<lb/>Eternity. It was ? maternal tender
						<lb/>faithfullness her character particular
						<lb/>ly show she pay'd unremitting
						<lb/>attention to the health of Her Chil
						<lb/>dren and had an agreeable method
						<lb/>of informing them an understand
						<lb/>ing, which indeed her
						<lb/>instructions pleasing, but as soon
						<lb/>as the first dawn of reason commen
						<lb/>c'd she taught them to pray to our
						<lb/>Saviour telling them of his great love
						<lb/>to and suffering for them so that they
						<lb/>shd not need to go from home for ???
						<lb/>??? of mind, she often procured
						<lb/>innocent sensible books for their</p>
				
					<cb/>
					<p>
						<lb/>amusement, for never were they
						<lb/>permited to sense an improper
						<lb/>shame. her watchfullness over her
						<lb/>two sons was exemplary, yet connected
						<lb/>with such affection that they were
						<lb/>drawn to obey her from love, tho'
						<lb/>severe discipline was not withdrawn held
						<lb/>when absolutely needfull. having apprenticed
						<lb/>her Eldest Son to the late Br Hazard
						<lb/>of Bath at his particular desire
						<lb/>where she knew he would be taken
						<lb/>care of, she returned to Bristol to place
						<lb/>her youngest son as an outdoor ap<hi rend="superscript:true;">ce</hi>
						<lb/>to Mr C Count Upholsterer in May
						<lb/>1795. and on July 13 she and her Survi
						<lb/>ving Daughter opened a Day School
						<lb/>with four scholars, in the ensue
						<lb/>ing July they had 40 to instruct which
						<lb/>school with many fluctuations. she
						<lb/>attended to till her sight failed, The
						<lb/>year following her Husband depart'd
						<lb/>this life relying in the merits &amp;
						<lb/>blood of Christ, she then attended
						<lb/>Tabernacle but was intent on accompan
						<lb/>ying her Son Rob<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi> to which ever place
						<lb/>of Worship he prefered that he might

						<lb/>why and the articulation was difficult
						<lb/>yet she gave all who spoke to her to
