    <h2>James Charlesworth</h2>
    <p> Personalia of our late d<sup>r</sup> B<sup>r</sup><a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000544.html">James Charlsworth</a><br />who enter'd into the Joy of
      his Lord<em>July 30th 1770</em> .<br /> Our late dr Br.<a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000544.html">James Charlesworth</a> has left the following short
      account <br /> of some of the most remarkable particular Circumstances of his Life till <br /> to the year <em>1753</em>.</p>
    <p>I was born at <a href="#mlpla000041.html">Little Gummersal in the parish of Birstal in the <br /> County of York</a> on the <em>16th Dec<sup>r</sup> 1721</em>. And was Educated by my Parents in
      <br /> the principles of the Church of England, in a strict &amp; careful manner, &amp; preserv'd <br /> from the Seductions w<sup>ch</sup> many people<sup>youths</sup> are expos'd to. When at
      the Age of <br /> 12 to 14 Years I began to keep company &amp; frequent some of the places <br /> of Diversions in the World; I never <sup>ed</sup> do it with the same ease &amp; <br />
      Satisfaction w<sup>ch</sup> I saw other people did, but always felt Remorse of <br /> Conscience, &amp; when I was alone often pray'd to our Sav<sup>r</sup> to have Mercy<br /> upon me &amp;
      keep &amp; preserve me from all Sin. At ab<sup>t</sup> the <em>age of 15</em>, I <br /> left off all Pleasures &amp; became acquainted with a small Company of Mysticks<br /> to whom I join'd my
      Self, Read their Books &amp; became very sober &amp; <br /> Religious, but found my poor heart wanted something w<sup>ch</sup> I had not.</p>
    <p> When I was about <em>7 years of age (in the Year 1739)</em> I become <br />acquainted with the B<sup>rn</sup> at their first coming to <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q163.html"
        >Yorkshire</a>, &amp; my dear <br />Sav<sup>r</sup> made me sensible of my lost state &amp; condition, &amp; the Misery &amp; Corruption <br /> of my Nature, &amp; that it was his Blood alone
        w<sup>ch</sup> in make me happy, <br /> &amp; as such a poor Sinner. I fled for Refuge to his wounds &amp; found peace<br /> thro' the Virtue &amp; power of his merits &amp; Death. In the year
        <em>1740</em>I went <br /> to <a href="#mlpla000054.html">Lond<sup>n</sup></a>. I staid some time w<sup>th</sup> the B<sup>rn</sup> there, &amp; return'd again to <br /><a
        href="#mlpla000054.html">Yorkshire</a> the <em>same year</em>. I was Reced into the Cong<sup>r</sup> <em>Decr: 8<sup>th</sup>. 1742</em><br /> soon after the Cong<sup>n</sup> was establishd
      here, &amp; was admitted to be a <br /> Partaker of the Body &amp; Blood of my Crucified Sav<sup>r</sup> w<sup>th</sup> the Cong<sup>n</sup><em>July <br /> 6<sup>th</sup> 1743</em>. I was
      Confirmd as a witness of the sufferings &amp; Atonem<sup>t</sup><br /> of the Lamb of <a href=".html">God</a> by <a href="#mlper000602.html">B<sup>r</sup> Spangenberg</a> the <em>21<sup>st</sup>
        Dec the same year</em><br /> before w<sup>ch</sup> had left my Busyness &amp; Relations &amp; went to Live at the </p>

    <p>first S. B<sup>rns</sup> Oeconomy at <a
        href="#mlpla000089.html">Holbeck</a> where I continued till the <em>20 <br /> July 1744</em>, when I was bless'd by imposition of hands to the Office of <br />Vorsteher of the S.
        B<sup>rn</sup>, after wch I was mostly employd in Preaching &amp; <br /> visiting the young Men in the different Societies, which I continued till <em>1748</em><br /> about w<sup>ch</sup> time
      I was obliged to engage so deeply in the Manufactory and <br /> other outward affairs that I declin'd preaching, &amp; for sev<sup>l </sup>years together <br /> went thro' a Scene of Distress in
      my own Mind with the External affairs <br /> in w<sup>ch</sup> I was engagd, however I continued therein to assist therein, &amp; went <br /> several times to <a href="#mlpla000179.html"

      satisfy all the Creditors, being willing to take all the Debt upon himself <br /> w<sup>ch</sup> had been Contracted without his knowledge &amp; Consent. 'Tis true I endea <br /> vour'd to
      hinder his engaging himself for such vast Sums of Money <br /> w<sup>ch</sup> He had no visible fund to discharge withal, &amp; wo'd rather have <br />suffer'd any hardships myself, than be the
      occasion of Involving his <br /> dr. Person, but he was Resolv'd to do it &amp; did it I dout not at the <br /> Command of his Lord &amp; Master, who <del>has</del> indeed has miraculously

      of these dangerous <br /> &amp; troublesome Affairs of the Cong<sup>n</sup>, I reckon I may also conclude <br /> one period of my Life w<sup>ch</sup> probably contains pretty near the whole
      <br /> of the mortal past &amp; when I look back how I have spent it and <br /> consider that I have been almost twice seven Years in the Kingdom <br /> of our <sup>dr</sup> Sav<sup>r</sup>, I

    <p> The office w<sup>ch</sup> he had in the Cong<sup>r</sup> at <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a> requiring that he <br /> sh'd have a Helpmate, He enter'd <em>Nov<sup>r

      faithful tender Husband, &amp; they have liv'd near 16 years together in <br />Grace &amp; Blessing.</p>
    <p> In the year <em>1755</em> when the place Cong<sup>n</sup> was Settled, He was <br /> appointed to be the Vorsteher (or Warden) of the Cong<sup>n</sup> at the same time <sup>that</sup> he
      <br /> had the direction of the Manufacture, &amp; in this Office He continued till <br /> it pleased our Lord to call him to his Eternal Rest.</p>
    <p> From the very beginning of the Settlement here, He was particularly <br /> engag'd in every undertaking &amp; till the year <em>1763</em>, all the external <br /> Affairs of this
        Cong<sup>n</sup> relating to the Settlement viz the Administration <br /> of the Estate &amp; Buildings, were in his Hands. In this Situation <br /> he had many difficulties to struggle with,
      &amp; felt often the Lord that <br /> was upon him with much concern. From the year <em>1755</em>, he was <br /> not only employed in the External affairs, but He &amp; His dear wife <br />
      assisted in the Internal Labour. <sup>In 1754 He was ordain'd a</sup><br /><sup>Deacon of the Brn's Church</sup></p>
    <p> In <em>June 1756</em>, he with his wife went to the Synod at <a href="mlpla000026.html">Berthelsdorf</a>. <br /> Tho' he was chiefly to the Service of the Cong<sup>ns</sup> in <a
        href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q163.html">Yorkshire</a>, yet he was <br /> also engag'd in the Affairs of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ockbrook.html">Ockbrook</a>, <a
        href="mlpla000035.html">Duckenfield</a>, &amp; in sundry concerns<br /> of the Unity &amp; our Lord having bestow'd upon him particular Gifts &amp; Grace<br /> to his Service, he remain'd
      active in all those matters.</p>
    <p> In the Year <em>1757</em> he was appointed to be one of the Board of <br /> Administation of the Affairs of the Unity in <a href="#mlpla000072.html">England</a>, &amp; was usefull <br />
      therein, &amp; when the Oconomates Con<sup>fr</sup> was Settled, he was appointed a</p>

    <p> a member thereof &amp; continued as such till that Con<sup>fer</sup> ceas'd in the <br />
      year <em>1769</em>. Tho' his Talents in the Conducting the external <sup>affairs</sup> were <br /> known &amp; priz'd by his B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; on that account He was constantly <br />
      employ'd in that way, yet he also wish'd to be rather employ'd in <br /> the Internal Labour, &amp; often express'd his desire to be freed from all <br /> his External engagements. In
      consequence of this his repeated <br /> Request, He was Released in <em>1763</em> from being immediately active <br /> in the Manufacture, tho' he remain'd the Counsellor in it till the <br />
      year <em>1766</em>; when it came into another Channel.</p>
    <p> Being Proprietor of the Estate, He frequently attended the Meetings <br /> of the Parish for conducting the Town's Busyness, &amp; by his prudent <br /> advice He gain'd the esteem of the
      acting persons in the Parish &amp; <br /> was of Service in this point of view to the Settlement.</p>
    <p> He went as Deputy of this Cong<sup>n </sup>to the Gen Synods at <a href="#mlpla000057.html">Marienborn</a><br /> in <em>1764</em> &amp; <em>last Year</em>, &amp; returned from the last very
      infirm, tho' his disorder <br /> w'd not permit him to go much about, yet he assisted in the Labour <br /> in the Cong<sup>n</sup> &amp; from this time, the publick Testimony of our Savr &amp;
      his <br />Suffrings &amp; the Discourses w<sup>ch</sup> he Deliver'd to the Cong<sup>n</sup> &amp; Choirs were <br /> particularly Anointed, &amp; being delivered with warmth of heart were
      <br /> attended with Blessing. So that some B<sup>rn</sup> made for thence the <br /> Remark that they believed he wo<sup>d</sup> not stay long in the Church below <br /> for he was preparing
      for the Church above. It was also observ'd <br /> in his Discourses &amp; Conversation, the apprehensions He had of the <br /> dangerouse principle of Free thinking &amp; acting w<sup>ch</sup>
      had crept in <br /> amongst us, w<sup>ch</sup> might be more hurtful to our Constitution, than <br /> any other difficulty we were sensible of</p>
    <p> He had for many years past frequent Sicknesses, &amp; having a <br /> great portion of sensibility, when matters did not go well &amp; contrary <br /> to his hopes, his Body felt the effects
      thereof. He was of a <br /> thinking disposition, &amp; when he was shut up in himself, his </p>

    <p>inward Grief prey'd upon him, of w<sup>ch</sup> he was sensible &amp; wo<sup>d
      </sup>speak <br /> of at times with concern. All this seem'd to impair his Body &amp; <br /><del>of the after land carnal which </del> He often said &amp; wrote that his chief <br /> Busyness
      &amp; concern was now to be prepar'd to leave this Body, &amp; <br /> to enter into the presence of his Lord.</p>
    <p> Last spring He had a very severe attack of the stone Cholick<br /> of w<sup>ch</sup> He Recovr'd so as to be active in his Office, yet the Effects <br /> were Visible. He had a second fitt of
      sickness with an Inflamation <br /> in his Face &amp; a violent pain in his Head by w<sup>ch</sup> he was confin'd <br /> to his Room ab<sup>t</sup> a fortnight, but was again so well Recover'd
      <br /> as to go about, but his Constitution was apparently weaken'd w<sup>ch</sup><br /> rais'd the apprehensions of his going home of w<sup>ch</sup> he spoke frequent <br /> ly with desire. He
      preached on the 15<sup>th</sup> to a very large Auditory <br /> with Life &amp; Energy, of the efficacious power in <a href=".html">Jesus</a>' Blood &amp; <br /> Death to make us New Creatures,
      and his last meeting kept in <br /> the Hall was a Discourse to the Cong<sup>n</sup> on the <em>16<sup>th</sup></em> for the Conclusion <br /> of the Cong<sup>n</sup> Day on the W. W<sup>d
      </sup>"Shew forth his Salvation from Day <br /> to Day." which he earnestly Recomended to the Br<sup>n</sup> &amp; S<sup>rs</sup> to put <br /> in practice in Life &amp; Conversation,&amp;
      entreated our D<sup>r</sup> Lord, kneeling <br /> to happily effect it with each &amp; the whole; this has prov'd his <br /> Valedictory discourse &amp; prayer for this Cong<sup>n</sup> &amp;
      the work of the <br /> Lord in general. He soon after had a Boil w<sup>ch</sup> gathered on his <br /> Shoulder &amp; was attended with much pain &amp; inflam'd his Back <br /> w<sup>ch</sup>
      threw him into a Bilious Fever. Even during his sickness <br /> he shew'd his wonted paternal heart in Counsel &amp; Friendship to <br /> those who came to him, as long as he had strength to
      speak. <br /> He was tender &amp; loving to all, saying once "I have nothing against <br /> any one &amp; hope no one has any thing against me. </p>

    <p> we were still in hopes that by
      the discharge of the Abcess in <br /> his Back (w<sup>ch</sup> was pretty large) his Constitution might have been <br /> Reliev'd &amp; he Restor'd to Health, but on the <em>29th</em> ab<sup>t
      </sup> 2 in the Morning <br /> we observ'd an Alteration &amp; that the weight of his disorder was <br /> fallen upon his Lungs, then it became evident that our gracious<br /> Lord intended to
      take him soon into his Joy, w<sup>ch</sup> he himself expect <br /> ed wo<sup>d</sup> be accomplished by the sametime real moving, amidst <br /> his pain &amp; weakness. He spent his time in
      such a tender loving <br /> &amp; Paternal manner towards all &amp; especially towards his dear <br /> wife &amp; Niece, &amp; those by orphans to whom he had been Guardian, <br /> &amp; in
      looking ardently to his faithful Lord in expectation of the <br />happy Moments quick approach; that it was truly edifying <br /> to all who came near him.</p>
    <p> After 12 o Clock in the Night he ask'd what were the Texts <br /> for the Day, w<sup>ch</sup> being Read as follows, the W: W<sup>d</sup>. "My Soul <br /> breaketh for longing that it hath
      unto thy Judgments at all <br /> times" Feelest thou the Blood Churches ardentLonging<br /> Cheek bedew'd with Million Tears forth thronging from th' <br />enamour'd Churches Face? And the

      god;" of which He took great notice, saying, <br /> how comfortable &amp; pretty they were, believing confidently <br /> the time drew near when Faith sho<sup>d</sup> be turn'd into Vision.
      <br /> when the Clock struck two, he seem'd something disappointed that he <br /> was yet here, &amp; when another hour was elapesd, He look'd up in <br /> an earnest manner, &amp; expressed in
      his great weakness &amp; pain</p>

    <p>his Desire to his d<sup>r</sup> Lord, to take him to himselfcomplaining<br /> that this hour had been very long. Thus he continued looking <br />
      for the happy moment being quite Sensible, &amp; when He co<sup>d </sup>speak <br /> no more, his Looks &amp; Gestures discover'd the object his Soul <br /> was engaged with, &amp; about half
      past Six his Lips turn'd Pale <br /> in Jesus' Arms &amp; bosom with the Blessing of the Cong<sup>n</sup> during <br /> a blessed Liturgy. A very happy Sensation of our d<sup>r </sup> Lord's
      presence <br /> was felt during this Night by the B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; S<sup>rs</sup> present, &amp; many <br />Tears accompanied his precious Soul to it eternal home. </p>
