						home <date type="death" when-iso="1770-04-18">Apl 18 1770</date> My Dear <orgName>Brn</orgName> &amp; <orgName>Sisters</orgName> It will without Doubt be Expected, that Some
						Thing Should be Said of the Life of our departed <roleName type="honorific">Brother</roleName>
						<persName ref="#mlper000547">John Astley</persName>, for it is usual amongst us but as he has left nothing from under his own Hand, and beside; has told me little or nothing by
						Word of Mouth, therefore I want Materials. He told one: that He was Born in <placeName>Lower Wyke</placeName> in the Year <date type="birth" when-iso="1712">1712</date>. and
						there learnd the Trade of a <name occupation="shoemaker">Shoemaker</name>. and there like wife He <name event="marriage">Married</name> The presant Widow, being a Wild Wicked

					<p> But by the Preaching of our Late <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Delamott</persName>: (who was invited in to <placeName

						Hearty concern about his Salvation, and that in this Situation of Heart &amp; Mind he fell early in to the hands of the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> who
						soon after his awakening came in to <placeName ref="#mlpla000084">Yorkshire</placeName>, and that by that Means, he was not only Happily preserv&apos;d from relapsing into his
						Former Course: but <add place="above">also</add> by the Simple and Evangelical Preaching of the <orgName>Brns</orgName>, he became convinced of our <roleName type="honorific"
								>Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> unmeasurable love &amp; Grace for Sinners; and became more, &amp; more acquainted, and Confident toward Him, and Therefore
						began to value, &amp; love the Fellowship of the <orgName>Brethren</orgName> and beg&apos;d for reception in to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> He &amp; his Wife, had
						this their Hearty desire Grented them as near as he could guess in the Year <date when-iso="1747">1747</date>. and were soon after admitted to the <name event="communion">Holy
							Communion</name>, for the first time. He thought </p>

					<p> It was the First <name event="communion">communion</name> which was kept in <placeName>Fulnek Hall</placeName> however be that as it will, it was the first to him in That
						Place, and Numbred with Him; amongst his particular Hours of Grace! From that Day: He has maintain&apos;d His communion with the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript"
							>rn</hi></orgName> to his Dying Hour, tho&apos; it was often times, but slenderly &amp; and with difficulty yet it never ceas&apos;d realy.</p>
					<p> They were <name event="marriage">Married</name> in the year <date when-iso="1733-02">1733 in Feb<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></date> and had a 11 Children 5 of whom are in the
							<placeName>Burying Ground</placeName> in <placeName ref="#mlpla000003">Fulnek</placeName>; one in <placeName>Hartshed Church</placeName> yard, one Daughter, at <placeName
							ref="#mlpla000035">Dukenfield</placeName>, and one at <placeName>Ockbrook Choir House</placeName>. and the other three i.e. one Son, and two Daughters don&apos;t belong to
						us. they had once a little <orgName en="œconomy">oeconomy</orgName> of <orgName>Single B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> at their House in
							<placeName>Hartshed</placeName>, but this was not their own but the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi></orgName> Projecting, but as it did not answer our <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> &amp; the<orgName> B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi></orgName> purposes it was soon Given up again.</p>
					<p> He has been her Some years, a pretty good <name office="steward">steward</name> and Servant of the little <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>
						in <placeName ref="#mlpla000059">Mirfield</placeName>, and so has also His present Widow, and therefore his Memory must remain Dear to us. He was a Child of Grace indeed, yet
							<hi rend="underline">his life was Chequer&apos;d o&apos;er with Grief and need.</hi></p>
					<p> His Domestick affairs have bore a very indifrent Trace these Many years, by which Means his credit was reduced considerably; and this not only with Strangers, but partricularly
						So among our own People, therefore I am rather inclin&apos;d to Draw a vail over the Most part of his Life. than to Expose it to Publick view.</p>
					<p> However: all is Well, what End<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> Well. altho the beginning and Middle had Some thing deploreable yet the end was adoreable. I have labour&apos;d upon
						it from the beginning of his Sickness to get his Mind off from all Eaternal concerns, as he could Mend nothing in it, &amp; entreated Him </p>
					<cb />
					<p> to Fix his heart and Eyes on our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> and on his <add place="above">all</add> atoneing Sacrifice, which advice
						he took Child-likely and became quite composed, and Chearlul in his Mind. we visited him pretty often in order to keep this Matter alive in his heart which has happily
						Succeeded on <date>Easter day</date> he Send for me, accordingly I wwent with 2 more <roleName type="honorific">Brethren</roleName> Pray&apos;d heartily by Him, kept a little
						liturgy, by his Bedside, &amp; gave him my last Blessing, thinking he could not live till I could come again. this little visit was attended with a most blessed feeling, So
						that I left him with a Heart quite Satisfy&apos;d.</p>
					<p> on <date>Easter Tuesday</date>, I and my Wife went to See him once more I was quite Edify&apos;d with his look &amp; Spoke tenderly to him, and Sung Some Suitable verses for
						him, in which he join&apos;d with us which we could see by the moving of his lips, this was the last happy little visit, for: the next Monday Early, he fell Softly and Happily
						asleep in his 58<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year. </p>
