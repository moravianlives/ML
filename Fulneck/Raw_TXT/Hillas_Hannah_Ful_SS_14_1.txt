The Single Sister Hannah Hillas who went to our
Saviour on the 23d of January has left the following
account of her self.
I was born April ye 19th 1745 at Bankhouse in the
Parish of Calverly and baptizd in the Church of England
my dear father being much concerned for our Preservation
sought and obtaind leave for my sister Mary and me to
go to Mile end to live in the Childrens Oeconomy there
where I accordingly went in my 3d year; here as a Child
I still remember how our dear Savr and to drew nigh to
me his poor little one, and gave me such a tender impression
of his love in my heart, that it never entirely left me, in
the year 1754 the Oeconomy being broke up I with my
Sister return'd to our Fathers house, which we did not at all
like being tenderly attach'd to the Children and Brn & Sisrs
in my 12th year my Sister by order of our Parents went
to live at Leeds which cost me no little concern haveing
before now never been parted, but soon recovering my spirits
I thought to depart my self with what this world calls
pleasures and so to spend my time; I soon lost all former
impressions I had had of our Saviours love to me and
and grew fond of the world with all its allurements, in
which I was quite alive hardening myself against all
convictions and resolved never to go to hear Brn any
more for fear that what I heard might make an im
pression on me; which my dear Father perceiving dis
tess'd him exceedingly and concerning which he spoke
to me with many tears and great emotion of heart I well
remember who he us'd to return from seeing my Sister at
Leeds how much affected he frequently was and upon my
once asking him the reason; he answered, dr Child, the
great disturbance of my mind is occasion'd by finding


you and your Sister and so much of the same sentiment
and I fear you'll both ruin'd by following your own
inclinations instead of the Lord Jesus Christ, but as yet
I was so hardened that all this made but little impression
on me soon after hearing my Father say that he must
go to York which happened just before Pudsey tide it please'd
me much thinking then I cou'd take my pleasures without
any restraint I accordingly made it out with my compa
nions how we would spend our time in all kinds of diversi
ons but the Sunday following being drawn (in manner
I know not how) to go to Fulneck where Br Latrobe
Preach'd and begun with singing the Verse, here
is an Ensign on a Hill, Come hither Sinners look
your fill, &c. I was so affected and overcome with such
a powerfull feeling that I resolved immediately to
drop all former resolutions and acquaintances
and live to our Saviour alone, but so weak were my
best efforts that I no sooner had got among my Companions
but I strove against all convictions, and enter'd into
my former wicked course with them with if possible
much more greediness than before and now tide time
being come and my Father being gone: all things
answer'd my wish we accordingly set out together in
order to gratify our inclinations but we had not gone
far before it was to me as if I heard a Voice say
remember thy Soul which so struck me together with
all my proceedings that I stood quite still and could
not go one step further. Oh how much did my present
situation afright me I thought Hell must be my portion
eternally for mercy I durst not call for thinking my
Sins were too great and I did verily believe, I should
Die with anguish of Soul, at all which my companions
were so offended that they reported that I was


I was out of my mind and I really believe they thought
me so, but this was nothing to me, I went home and left
than as soon as I could, what I now has heard in the
Preaching the preceeding Sundays, made such an
impression on one that I resolv'd from that Day to be
our Saviours at all events, it was now to me as if my Eyes
were open'd, I saw myself the worst of creatures and pray'd
incessantly to our dr Saviour to have mercy on me and
help me; all my desires were now entirely chang'd, I
sought after nothing, but our dr Saviour and the
fellowship with his dr People, and my dr Father
returning home. I took the first opportunity to aquaint
him with my very great and important desire, namely
to live with the Sisters, and that I should be no more
happy in my present situation, which so rejoyc'd and
affected him, that he shed many tears with me, thank
ing our dr Saviour for this blessed change, he accordingly
went to Fulneck the next day, and interceeded in my
behalf that I might come and live with the Sisters,
fearing if it should be delay'd I might loose the
impression; I accordingly obtaind leave, and went in a
fortnight after. May 2nd 63 to live in this blessed House
where I have been ever since, and where amidst manifold
imperfections I am inclined to thank and praise our dr
Saviour whenever I think on it. May 4th in 1763 I
was received into the Singles Sisters Choir which was the
first I had enjoy'd; and on which day I was so happy that
I could do little but weep, lamenting my past life and thinking
I could never enjoy the present sufficiently in this pleasant and
comfortable manner I remain'd two years expecting it would
always be so with me but entering into reasoning with myself


I lost this impression and came into darkness and confusion
not being able to comprehend how it was that I should be then
with me I gradually lost all confidence in our dr Saviour
and believd I never should he happy any more and grew quite
dejected, in this way I remain'd a year and half till our
dr Sister Anna Rosel came here who was of great service
to me and to whom I soon got confidence to disclose in a 
simple manner the situation of my heart, whereby I was
helpd to find my road again to our Saviour and an impression
I was helped him to be in reality my friend both seasons
In March following 1767 I was Spectator for the first
time at the Holy Communion and enjoyd for the first time
and enjoy'd so much for my poor Soul there that I thought
it was impossible for me to be kept much longer from the
participation thereof, but little expected that I should have
the great grace conferd upon one the next Month to enjoy
the same with the Congregation, O how was I ??? at receiving
myself and enjoy'd at the wonderfull kindness and great
condescention of the Lord to me his poor one, I cant help
shedding tears of love and gratitude whenever I think of it
I was thought I had got all I wanted and was quite Happy
in my dr Saviour thinking all was well with me, But
also how was I mistaken when at the very next Communion
my Eyes were open'd to my natural depravity in such
a manner as I had never before experienced, I now
felt in reallity what human nature is, and was much
frightened at it. I found myself seated with the Congn
at the Holy Communion, but did not know whether I
durst partake of it, I pray'd most sincerely to our Survivor
to help me in this undone situation and he certainly


did so far as to compose my mind that I could partake
of the Communion to the real benefit of my Soul, but
still I found myself afterwards not set at liberty from
this trouble but durst not communicate it to my Labouress
nevertheless I thought by it to another Sister whom I ex
pect could give me good advice, I might be help accordingly
I hinted something of my present distress to one but finding
that she was unexperienced in it I dropt it with the intention
of keeping it to myself in that way I went on for some time
oftentimes much perplexed not knowing what would be the
consequence, sometimes praying to our dr Saviour very earnestly
to help me and at other times feeling a strong inclination
to cherish what I felt, I was backward in speaking openhearte
dly with my Labouress believing no one to have felt
themselves so bad, but one day being at my band, the Sister
that kept it came upon the conversation of feeling oneself
as one really is by nature. I hereupon venturd to note how
it was possible, that at the most important opportunitys
one could feel themselves most depravd to which she noted
it was faithfullness in our dr Saviour to such a Soul and
no one ought to be too much dejected at it for he thereby
means to bless us and advised me to look to him with all
that might oppress me as a Child does to his parents and
I should be helped in all cases, and this comforted me so that I
soon resolved to throw my burden under his Cross, and there
I found release from all my misery my dr Savior again
owned me his poor one in a particular manner forgiveing
me my manifold Sins, and let me feel his sweet Peace
which I now could enjoy without any interruption.
In the year 1765 it pleased our Saviour to take to himself


My dr Father in whom I had a real friend, this
was a new trial to me concerning which I spoke freely
with my Labouress and she telling me, if I would but cleave
close to our Saviour and make him my father and friend
I should be help'd thro alltho circumstances might have ever
such a precarious appearance, upon this I covnanted
again with my best friend to keep me in his hand and to
preserve me as his blood bought property as long as I should
remain in this Vale of tears, and he visibly comforted me.
the Grace I have to live in such a blessed Congn was again
renew'd to me, where the opportunities in the same, and
particularly those of my Choir, has been of great service to me
I also had the favour to serve in my small degree in my
Choir and can truly say it was a great pleasure to me to serve
my dr Sisters in what I possibly could for our Saviours
sake and have often found cause to  crave forgivness from my best
friend for not being more resignd and satisfyd that I
was not able to do more in this way. in the year 1782 My
dr Mother came to live in the Widows Choir House here
which was another remarkable occurance in my life which
I cannot easily pass over, because it so much resounds
to the Honnour of my dr Saviour, my dear Mother as is well
known did not belong to the Congn till now, but he who knows
best, how to being things into order and at the right time
so inclin'd her heart that she beg'd for this Grace, which
upon my hearing did so strike me, that I could scarse believe
I heard aright, I immediately made her request known which
was granted her, and there she has been ever since with her
whole heart and I have great reason to thank our Saviour
for this still praying that all my Brn and Srs may be


brought to the knowledge of him and his love tho' late in this
their day: how shall I poor Child thank him even in eternity
sufficiently for such great love so repeatedly experienced by
me, I in brief sum up the whole with these lines, be for
all this Husband of Souls here and in Heaven act above &c.
So far her own account and we can add that she through the
Grace of our Saviour priz'd her call to the Congn very highly
and more so as she had such manifest proofs of his faithfullness
towards her and enjoy'd the priveledges of it as a poor Sinner
thinking herself unworthy of it she has been us'd among us
as an Overseer in a Room, which office she performed with
great faithfullness and willingness, and was much belov'd
by her Sisters, some years ago she got a strong spitting of
blood, since which time she has been very weakly, but being
naturally of a very lively turn she remained active as long
as she was able. December the 15th last year being the anniversary
of our moving into our present Choirhouse, all the Opportunitys
on that day was particularly blessed to her, and feeling herself
already very poorly, secretly thought maybe our Saviour will
soon take me to himself, not many days after she was
violently taken with her old disorder, and was obliged to
move into the Sick Room, and this being so often repeated
that notwithstanding all possible means being us'd it was
soon to be perciev'd that this would prove the occasion of
her desolution therefore she brought her outward matters
into order and said now I have nothing more to do but to
beg our dr Saviour to give me patience to bear what he


pleases to lay in me, for we understand one another and
I go to him as a poor Sinner whom he has redeem'd with his
most precious blood. She was sundry times visited by her
dr Mother and Brn and Sisters whom she recommended
to our dr Saviour telling them how happy it would be for
each when they once go out of this World to know him; and
how she rejoyced to go over into his Arms on the 23 she enjoy'd
once more in great weakness the Holy Communion for which
she was very thankfull, and only wish'd in this feeling to go
and kiss and only great the Prints in hands and Feet.
which favour was granted the same Evning with the
blessing of her Choir and the Congregation.
