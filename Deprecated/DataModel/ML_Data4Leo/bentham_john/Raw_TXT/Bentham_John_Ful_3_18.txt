The Life of the mar'd Brother John Bentham who
was called Home the 9th August 1772. 
He has dictated the following concerning himself.
I was born at Black Hay in Pudsey Township 1713
& baptised in the Church of England My Mother being poor &
not able to care for me I was put out by the family as a Towns apprentice to
a Presbiterian. I had no Mind to go on Sundays with any
Mother to his place of Worship, & having no Concern on my Mind
about my Salvation I went no where. My Master observing this
told me I should be lost if I continued in the way I then was, & should go
to a place of Torment when I died. This had the Effect upon me
that I went to Church & then I thought my Case was safe, but even
this proved the Occasion to hurtful Entanglements, & also to my
marrying unhappily which was attended with many painful Con-
sequences. By this Marriage I had 2 Daughters. When Mr. Ingham
began to preach in these parts I want to hear him, & the Word had
some Effect upon me for some Time, but alas, I soon got into my
old wretched Course again. Being one Sunday at Tong Church I was
asked by the late Br Jonathan Heartly to go with him to hear the
Brethren at Bankhouse; at first I told him I would not, but he
however prevailed upon so to do, & I have abundant Reason to
thank my dear Savr that He inclined me to go. What I there heard
of the Love of our Savr melted my heart & had the Effect upon
me that I returned home in a very different Mind to what I
had before, being now determined to seek in earnest after
the Salvation of my Soul, nor could I afterwards have Rest
or Satisfaction till I found Mercy & peace in Jesus Christ.
Soon after this I was rec'd into the Society, & March 25th 1758 I was
red'd into the Congn, & the same Year was admitted to the holy Com-
munion & spent my Time in a truly happy Manner in sweet
Fellowship with my kind Lord & Redeemer. This was a most


blessed Season to my poor Heart, & happy would it have been
for me if I had remained in this Connexion with my Savr
but turning aside from Him & not proving this Grace nightly 
I gave Opportunity to the Enemy to blind my Eyes again, to
lay hold of me as his Captive & to lead me according to his Will,
& thus was brought into most shameful & scandalous Things
to the unspeakable Grief of the whole Congn, & still more to
the Grief & Reproach of my merciful Savr, & which was
oftenwards attended Lord with much Loss, Distress & Anguish
to my own Soul as no one but myself can have a true Con-
ception of. I brought myself into Hell Torment indeed
for I forfeited my place & privileges in the Congn, & lost
all Sight & feeling of my Savr & my Sins lay so heavy upon
me that I knew no possible way of living in this Condition,
All which Misery was occasioned by the well known Circum-
stances of my second Marriage. I & my wife being both
guilty & also both miserable & unhappy beyond Description
we knew not what to do but to weep & cry to Jesus that if
possible He might look on us in our deplorable Condition
& shew Mercy unto us. He was also entreated of us &
had Mercy upon such abominable Sinners as we were,
that we could believe & feel that He had pardoned our many
& heinous Transgressions. We then prayed the whole Congn
to forgive us & receive us once more into her Fellowship
& which in Time was granted unto us to our abiding Consola-
tion. This was a Grace which I shall thank my sweet Savr
for throughout my whole Life & also in Eternity. From this
Time I have been enabled to live under a bowing Sense of
my sweet Savr Love, & the Blessings I have enjoyed in the
Congn have been highly prized by me; yea every the least


Crumb I enjoyed I rec'd
out of Mercy as a Favour I was undeserving of.
I shall never be able to thank Him duly for what He has done for me
poor unfaithful Sinner, but shall etarnally sing of his Love &
Mercy & Faithfullness. So far out of his Account.
Since his Readmission to the Congn he has spent his Time
as a Sinner who had received Grace, & acknowledged him-
self very undeserving of what he enjoyed. Some Time ago
his Constitution began to break & he daclinad gradually, but
was chearful in his Heart & confident to our Savr & thus
continued till he obtained permission to enter into the 
joy of his Lord.
