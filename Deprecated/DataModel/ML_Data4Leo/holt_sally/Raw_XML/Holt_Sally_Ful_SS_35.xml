					<l>Parish of Stockport in Cheshire on</l>
					<l>the 25 Day of Feb: 1727 where she Liv&apos;d till</l>
					<l>about 1743, when she being stirr&apos;d up in </l>
					<l>her Heart by the Holy ghost to seek after</l>
					<l>the Salvation of her soul and sometime af</l>
					<l>ter hearing the Testimony of the Brn; &amp; being</l>
					<l>convinced of the truth &amp; simplicity of the</l>
					<l>gospel Taught by them, Drew accquaintance</l>
					<l>with them and in the year 1748 gain&apos;d the</l>
					<l>favour to Live in the Single Sisters House in</l>
					<l>Duckenfield where she behav&apos;d very well</l>
					<l>&amp; was Loved by all. </l>
					<l>Having afterwards along with some more</l>
					<l>sisters paid a visit To the Congregation in</l>
					<l>Yorkshire she express&apos;d her Mind &amp; hearty</l>
					<l>Desire to be a member of that Body.</l>
					<l>Hearing of the Single Sisters Here being</l>
					<l>built she would say O! that our Saviour may</l>
					<l>once grant me the favour to live in that house</l>
					<l>In the month of September 1750 she with</l>
					<l>the rest of the Oconomy Removing from Duck</l>
					<l>enfield to Live in Yorkshire Took her abode in </l>

					<l>faction both of herself &amp; her sisters, Only</l>
					<l>as she was not Receiv&apos;d in the Congregation</l>
					<l>would sometimes give her Pain</l>
					<l>In the Latter End of the Year 1751 she</l>
					<l>begun to be a little Disorder&apos;d by the</l>
					<l>Rhoumatism which settled in her Arm &amp; </l>

					<l>also being attended with a Dropsical dis</l>
					<l>ease &amp; a Complication of disorders Ren</l>
					<l>der&apos;d her almost incapable of Business.</l>
					<l>Her Reception lay very near her Heart &amp;</l>
					<l>she Often would sigh &amp; weep after a nearer</l>
					<l>fellowship with our dear Saviour &amp; his Church</l>
					<l>Thus she continued all Summer &amp; as to</l>
					<l>health Better &amp; Worse</l>

					<l>long had wish&apos;d for: But she had not Long</l>
					<l>Enjoy&apos;d this happiness before her Joy </l>
					<l>in some Respect Interrupted by the re</l>
					<l>turn of her Disorder in a much greater</l>
					<l>Degree than before &amp; in the beginning</l>
					<l>of the Present year the Dropsey siezing</l>

					<l>quite useless by the Rhoumatism &amp;c</l>
					<l>she was not able to help herself there</l>
					<l>fore was Oblig&apos;d to take her Room &amp;</l>
					<l>now it was she begun to think of going home</l>
					<l>&amp; speaking to a Sister about it Said you</l>
					<l>will See One of the Poorest &amp; perhaps</l>
