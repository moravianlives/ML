						into the <orgName en="œconomy">Children's Oeconomy</orgName>, he was a
						very lovely Child, beloved by all about him. When he arrived to his Boys

						<rs ref="#mlper000544" cert="high">Charlesworth</rs> &amp; others about him.
						I was evident that there was a Work of Grace in his Heart, be those who were

						become a happy <roleName type="honorific">Brother</roleName>, but that he
						would also be useful in our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> kingdom, In these Years he was

					<p> took place in him, so that his Soul rec'd a Hurt at this Time which was

					<p> After he set up Business for himself, it obliged him &amp; to make some
						Journeys to <rs ref="#mlpla000054" cert="high">London</rs>, where
						Temptations were renewed, to draw him altogether into the World, and
						altho' the Staff of Corruption &amp; strong tendencies thereto lay in

						Resolution to go into the World, yet this divided Heart &amp; continual
						Struggle betwixt our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> &amp; the World caused him a heavy &amp; truly
						unhappy Life that one could not see and speak with him without being moved
						with compassion. A Times he was much concerned about his unhappy State of
						Heart &amp; wished our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> might attain his Aim with him; he also was some
						times very sensibly Struck with the strong proofs he had of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> Faithfulness
						to him &amp; by seeing how He kept his Hand over Him. This had the effect
						upon him that he once in a particular Manner pray'd our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> if He saw no
						other way of obtaining his Aim with him to do it by giving him a sickly
						Habit of Body, <add place="above">or taking him to himself</add> rather than
						suffer him to go into the World, &amp; he has often considered our <roleName type="honorific">Sv<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> Dealings with
						him as an Answer to this Prayer. <date when-iso="1771-08" cert="low">About a
							half a Year ago</date>, as he was going to Leeds &amp; had still
						thoughts of pursuing a Worldly Scheme, tho' with much uneasiness of
						Mind &amp; Having pray'd as above, he stop'd &amp; looked back for
						his Company when he got a Vomiting of blood, which was the beginning of his
						last Sickness.</p>
					<p> About <date when-iso="1771-12" cert="medium">2 months ago</date> it was
						observed that his tender </p>
					<p> and weakly Constitution turned into a <name health="disease">Consumption</name> &amp; he declined very fast. He was frequently
						visited by many <roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></roleName>, for he was generally beloved, &amp; when it drew
						nearer his End that he himself begun to think, he would soon go home, he
						spoke with <name>great concern</name>, to Some of the
						Labourers whom he had most Confidence in &amp; had been best acquainted
						with, and Lamented that he had spend much of his Time so poorly with
						Reasoning, Reading unprofitable Books, neglecting the Meetings &amp; other
