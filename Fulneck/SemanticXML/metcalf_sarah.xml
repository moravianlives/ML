					The Course of life of the Single Sister Sarah Metcalf
					I was born at Southowram feb<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. 16 1708 &amp; Baptzd in 
					the Church of England, &amp; many drawings of Grace 
					was perceptable to me in my Childrens years which
					I made use of <del>by</del>
						<add place="above">in</add> the dutys of the Church in hopes
					of pleasing God, to the Saving of my Soul from
					Eternal Distruction, &amp; as I grew in years I beleived
					myself in such a State of happiness prefable to my
					dear mother that I became so concerned about her Salv.
					that I cou'd have no heaven in Eternity without Her
					tho' I had no knowledge of our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> or that there was
					any other Salvation then what was founded on a
					religious Life &amp; conversation - &amp; perceived a real
					Enmitie in my heart to any one that thought themselves
					better then myself, yet at the same time felt many
					Emotions in me after the evil &amp; vanities of the world
					&amp; plainly perceived that my pious course of Life was
					&amp; continual dissappointment to me to the working
					up wrath &amp; disscontentment, &amp; when my B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> told me that
					my Sister had experience the forgiveness of Her Sins
					in the bitterness of my Soul said it was all falseness &amp;
					delution for there was no such thing to be attaind, my
					necessities of heart brought me to frequent the Meetings
					kept by the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rns</hi> at Smithhouse &amp; also at my fathers
					yet a midst all this I lik'd not to venture upon any

			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_32Metcalf-02.jpg" n="2" />

					<add place="above">foundation</add> then my own works &amp; selfrighteous &amp; quotation from
					the Scripture <add place="above">for my walk &amp; conversation</add> yet my heart remaind as hard as Stone
					&amp; I found it a perplexing Circumstance to my Mind
					when ever I thought of being separated from my mother
					Either in Time or in Etermity &amp; continued <add place="above">to live</add> with my parents
					till they both departed out of time which to the best
					of my remembrance was about my 35 years.
					I apply myself closely to the preachings Especially those
					kept by Br Spaningburg which prov'd a great
					blessing to me I was also look into bands &amp; Class as
					amongest the Single Sisters, &amp; a midst all carry<hi rend="superscript:true;">'d</hi> Many
					disstressing Conviction of my lost condition particularly
					at my Spinning one day I was Sized with such Terrors
					of Hell &amp; damnation that I saw myself in a Much
					worst situation Then Judas, who betray'd the Lord
					of Life &amp; Glory, those terrors was succeedd by a
					comfortable asshurence that my Crucified Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> had
					died for all my Sins, the cherefulness of heart
					which I now enjoyed sweetend all the Labour of my
					attendance of my sick Brother <add place="above">who thro Lameness </add>had been some
					years confined unto his bed, &amp; as I was one day going
					to fulneck to the Meeting, I open meself a verse as following
					oh Church of God redeemd Bride, believe it &amp; thereby abide
					this strength<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> &amp; refreshs my heart so as If a Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Covenantd
					with me to remain His &amp; His people forever mine
					July 24 1748 I was received into the congregation which
				
			</p>
			<cb />
			<p>
				
					which was a great Grace to me, my B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> from this
					Time Sicken very perceptably &amp; thro' the repeated
					visits of the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rns</hi> got a Clear Manifestation of
					our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> redeeming Love &amp; departed happyly in a
					comfortable relyance of His blood &amp; merits, &amp; in 2 months
					Time I had the Oppertuinity given to remove into the
					Oconomie at Cleckheaton in which place I injoy'd many
					happy hours &amp; days &amp; from thence a move to the occonomie
					at low house &amp; also after that upon the Hill as I become
					incurable in my health it gave me a better Oppertunity to
					injoy the meeting of my Choir &amp; congregation &amp; on aug 4
					1749 I had the inexepressable Grace to become a participant
					of the body &amp; blood of Jesus Sacrementily, which was
					a matter of great abasement for me poor unworthy worm
					at the removal of the Choir into the Choir house
					I was one of that number, that had the Grace to be one
					of the first inhabitants, &amp; injoyd that perticular
					previlidge of being at the Choir Communion kept
					by the dear Deciples &amp; have enjoyed all the blessd
					previlidgs of the Choirhouse to the Mutual Satisfaction
					&amp; blessng of My heart which thro' the various schooling
					of the dear Holy Ghost have got to see what a poor wretchd
					&amp; spoilt Creature I have been &amp; am by nature, but thro'
					his bloody merits I have been inabled to walk my Course
					with Joy &amp; comfort as a poor Sinner, &amp; wish from the
					bottom of my heart to have been &amp; seen more &amp; more

					<hi rend="strikethrough:true;">more &amp; more</hi> of that great Happyness that is injoy<add place="above">able</add>
					in a Humble &amp; Sinnerlike walk &amp; conversation yet
					a midst all my Great poverty &amp; innabilitie of Heart
					<add place="above">I wish'd</add> to be in any wise a Joy &amp; Satisfaction to my dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
					yet in his aboundant Love &amp; mercy he coud like
					to prove it to the Grace of being Choir Diciples
					in which period I felt my choir near &amp; dear to me
					Even to have cost me tears to <add place="above">feel</add> which an inabilities
					&amp; unworthyness to such a Grace &amp; the dear H Ghost
					often Testified to my heart that a Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; His rich
					merits was a sufficent for me &amp; my choir &amp; I was
					Glad &amp; thankful to let go all self righteousness &amp;
					feel my self a needy Sinner before my Lord &amp; Saviour
					thro' percied Feet.
