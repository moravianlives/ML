            <lb/>The course of Life of the S. Sister <hi rend="underlined:true;">Hannah Taylor</hi>
            <lb/>She was born Febr 16. 1740. at Wyke and brought
            <lb/>up by her Parents, who sent her to one of the Brns
            <lb/>schools, viz. to Martha Haley, where she enjoy'd
            <lb/>the childrens meetings to a Blessing for her heart
            <lb/>being of a pensive turn, caused her often even
            <lb/> while young, very serious reflection's concerning
            <lb/>her self, in which case she turnd to our Savr <hi rend="strikethrough:true;">in</hi>
            <lb/>and found in Him her only comfort
            <lb/>In the Year 1767. She went to Live with Br &amp; Sister.
            <lb/> Zander, and served them with all faithfulnes
            <lb/>till Sister Zander went home, when She obtain'd
            <lb/>permission To move in to the Sisters oeconomy
            <lb/>at Gumersal, Here she soon gain'd the love of
            <lb/>the Sisters, but her natural reserved Dissposition
            <lb/>caus'd her and others some pain in the beginning,
            <lb/>which however soon more of, as she got more freedom
            <lb/>and could confidently Speak her hearts Situation
            <lb/>just as it was, it was very perceptible that the Holy
            <lb/>Ghost <hi rend="strikethrough:true;">let</hi> her in to a deeper Knowledge of her own
            <lb/>depravity, which together with her Natural Timorus
            <lb/>mind, made her often Express a Doubtful concern,
            <lb/>lest she should not continue to the End, she had
            <lb/>the Grace to cleave to our Savr in these Circumstances
            <lb/>and long'd Ardently for a nearer Connextion with
            <lb/>Him &amp; His people by Reception in to the Congrn
            <lb/>which was granted her April 20 1772. to her great joy.
            <lb/>March 20 1773. She had the favour to be the first 
            <lb/>time Spectator at the holy Comuinon, and as it
            <lb/>was dear to her that She was in a <hi rend="strikethrough:true;">def</hi> decline</p>

			<p>
            <lb/>her only desire now was to obtain the End of all her
            <lb/>wishes Namely to be a participant of the Body &amp;
            <lb/>Blood in the holy Sacrament, for her sickness proved
            <lb/>a real searching time to her, during which she kept
            <lb/>many very openhearted Bands with her choir Labroures
            <lb/>and it was manifest that our dear Savr was preparing
            <lb/>her for him self, of which She was very sensible
            <lb/>desiring only to be fitted here for his Eternal Embraces
            <lb/>Her longing desire was granted her on her Sickbed
            <lb/>a few days before her departure during a Blessed
            <lb/>feeling to all who were present, She lay very still for
            <lb/>Some Time in a deep Enjoyment of this great Grace
            <lb/>Expressing her thankfulness that she now had Enjoy'd
            <lb/>all She had wishd for in this world, and now only
            <lb/>waited for the last Kiss from His pale Lips,
            <lb/>The last night she desired the Sisters might be called up,
            <lb/>when she took a tender leave of them, saying o my dear Sister
            <lb/>it I was but able to tell You what I enjoy, If I had
            <lb/>but known before what a Gracious Savr, he is to poor need
            <lb/>Sinners, once more let me intreat You to believe in Him, 
            <lb/>She could not Express the tender gratitude of her heart
            <lb/>sufficiently to those around her, but as a truly Enamor'd
            <lb/>heart lookd out with longing for the happy moment,
            <lb/>when her beloved would receive her in to his Arms,
            <lb/>desiring the Sisters to join in her petition, that He might
            <lb/>soon come &amp; take her to him <unclear>self</unclear>, which he accordingly
            <lb/>did on May 18 1773. in the 33 year of her Age
            <lb/>accompanied with the Blessing of her choir, and
            <lb/>a sensible feeling of the nearness of her un Seen
            <lb/>Friend and Bridegroom, with whom she now rests
            <lb/>in Peace</p>
