					<p> I was born July 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> 1820 at <lb/> Mapperly, a small village in

					<p> My dear mother being a decided <lb/> child of God endeavoured to <lb/> bring her children

						remember the <lb/> time when my thoughts were <lb/> not wont to dwell upon
						serious <lb/> things; but, alas! they were too <lb/> much of a reasoning,
						sceptical <lb/> nature. Very little took place <lb/> during my childhood
						that is <lb/> worth recording. I had the <lb/> privilege of attending a
						small <lb/> school, that was kept by the <lb/> daughters of a most worthy
						&amp; <lb/> excellent Independent Minister, <lb/> whose loving &amp;
						affectionate manner, </p>

				<div type="page" n="8">
					<pb n="8" facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_53Fletcher-09.jpg"/>
					<p> will ever be sweet to my memory. <lb/> I attended their school until I was
						<lb/> in my 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year, when my dear Mother <lb/>
						placed me in the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> house at <lb/> Ockbrook, -
						where, after a few weeks, <lb/> I became exceedingly happy and <lb/>
						comfortable, the life of a S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> house <lb/> being
						well adapted to my naturally <lb/> cheerful, yet somewhat reserved <lb/>
						disposition. </p>
					<p> In the beginning of 1837 I received, <lb/> with several others of my
						companions, <lb/> instruction for confirmation, or rather <lb/> in my case
						for adult baptism. <lb/> My dear Mother being a Baptist <lb/> I had
						consequently not received <lb/> that sacrament in infancy. </p>
					<p> But I cannot say that either the <lb/> instructions, or the rite itself,
						made <lb/> any lasting impression on my mind. <lb/> I enjoyed the
						instructions, as I did <lb/> imbibing knowledge of any kind that <lb/> came
						in my reach. </p>
					<p> Unawares almost to my self, I formed <lb/> my own views on the way of
						salvation, <lb/> &amp; as might be expected stumbled upon <lb/> many errors.
						At one time I was  <lb/>seeking <hi rend="underline">fruits</hi> of the
						Spirit, instead of </p>
					<cb/>
					<p> simply going to Jesus, &amp; At another <lb/> time I was fully impressed
						with the <lb/> idea, that though I was <lb/> very very far from what I ought
						<lb/> to be as a Christian, yet I must <lb/> wait the Lord's time to
						make me <lb/> different, I could do nothing. At <lb/> this time
						"Baxter's saints' rest" <lb/> fell into my hands, which
						by <lb/> the blessing of the Lord made a <lb/> very deep impression on my
						mind, <lb/> &amp; showed me that there was much <lb/> for me to do, viz. an
						earnestness of <lb/> Spirit, &amp; a determination to give <lb/> the Lord no
						rest, till he was gra-
<lb/>
ciously pleased to reveal himself <lb/> to me.
						From this time I <hi rend="underline">was</hi>
						<lb/> much more in earnest, but my <lb/> adorable Saviour was not my all
						<lb/> in all; consequently the way seemed <lb/> long &amp; heavy &amp; I
						often felt inclined <lb/> to exclaim: "Who is sufficent for <lb/> these
						things!" </p>
					<p> In the year 1850 I received a call <lb/> to be the Warden of the S<hi rend="superscript">le</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in Fulneck,
						<lb/> &amp; though deeply conscious of my own <lb/> insufficiency for such a
						post, I felt </p>
				</div>
				<div type="page" n="9">
					<pb n="9" facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_53Fletcher-10.jpg"/>
					<p> such a strong conviction that it <lb/> was from the Lord, that I dared <lb/>
						do no other than accept it. </p>
					<p> In the first year I had many trials <lb/> and difficulties, caused in a
						great <lb/> measure by my own inexperience, <lb/> but afterwards my work was
						very <lb/> pleasant &amp; light to me. </p>
					<p> The 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> year after I came to Fulneck, <lb/> the
						texts for my birthday struck me <lb/> very much, on looking at them some
						<lb/> time before. The daily word was: <lb/> "In the Lord shall all the
						seed of <lb/> Israel be justified &amp; shall glory. Is. 45.25 <lb/> &amp;
						the doctrinal text was, the second of Acts <lb/> &amp; the latter part of
						the 47<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> verse: "And the <lb/> Lord added
						to the Church daily such as <lb/> should be saved." I felt to hope,
						that <lb/> these texts had a reference to some, that <lb/> were very near
						&amp; dear to me, who were <lb/> not added to any <del>Church</del>
						Christian <lb/> Church, &amp; over whom my heart had <lb/> often yearned. I
						never thought of <lb/> them in connexion with myself, <lb/> I thought I was
						added to the Church, <lb/> &amp; of the <hi rend="underline">real
							meaning</hi> of the daily word <lb/> I had at that time very little
						knowledge. <lb/> O! how possible it is it is to deceive ourselves <lb/>
						&amp; others!. On the morning of my birthday </p>
					<cb/>
					<p> I found three verses on my table <lb/> which had been drawn &amp; placed
						<lb/> there by a very dear &amp; worthy sister, <lb/> as was her custom, the
						three were <lb/> very striking. The text of one was <lb/> "Lovest thou me?"
						To which was <lb/> added the verse </p>
					<p>
						<lg type="stanza" n="1">
							<l>"Lovest thou me? I hear my Saviour say,</l>
							<l>"Would that my heart had power</l>
							<l>"to answer, yea, </l>
							<l>"Thou knowest all things, Lord in</l>
							<l>heaven above </l>
							<l>"And earth beneath, thou knowest</l>
							<l>that I love! </l>
							<l>"But 'tis not so, - in word, in deed,</l>

							<l>"I do not, cannot love thee as I ought;</l>
							<l>"<hi rend="underline">Thy love</hi> must give that power; thy love

					</p>
					<p> On reading the last line I exclaimed <lb/> with clasped hands, Oh my beloved

						<lb/> Oh the sink of iniquity I saw there <lb/> Sin did indeed revive &amp;
						I died <lb/> Rom. 7:9. So heavy was the weight <lb/> of guilt<name emotion="guilt"/> upon me, that

						for ever, neither will I be always wroth: <lb/> for the spirit should fail

					<p> To be unexpectedly called upon <lb/> to part with a friend so faithful <lb/>

					<p> As a fellow labourer and <lb/> member of our Elders' Conference <lb/>
						our dear Sr. Fletcher was much <lb/> esteemed by us all for the candour
						<lb/> of her mind, and her strictly conscien-  <lb/> tious discharge of her
						official duties. <lb/> She would ever openly &amp; clearly <lb/> state her
						views on any subject she <lb/> was interested in, and in case of a <lb/>
						difference of opinion firmly and <lb/> faithfully maintain her cause, <lb/>
						without, however, in the least being <lb/> self opinionated or obstinate.
						Her <lb/> warm interest in the Lord's work <lb/> and the spread of his

						manifested, not <lb/> only unto the Searcher of hearts, who <lb/> delights

						the Bible Society, <lb/> and so forth. The local Committees of <lb/> these
						Associations will miss in her <lb/> a valued member, and a successful <lb/>

						things <lb/> relating to Missionary enterprises, <lb/> especially those
						connected with our <lb/> own church, of which she was a very <lb/>
						consistent &amp; attached member. </p>
					<p> She also took her place as a <lb/> Teacher in our Sunday School, and <lb/>
						by her prayerful and careful prepa- <lb/> ration for her work succeeded in
						<lb/> securing the love and gratitude of <lb/> her Scholars, to whose hearts
						her memory <lb/> is much endeared by her valued <lb/> instructions in
						spiritual things. She </p>
					<cb/>
					<p> now rests from her labours, and her</p><p><lb/> works do follow her. Whatever she
						<lb/> did, she did unto the Lord, and this <lb/> imparted real worth to her
						activity. <lb/> Her memory is dear to us. </p>
					<p> When the Minister of the Congreg<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. <lb/> saw her
						on the evening of the so called <lb/> Sisters' Coming in Day, she was

						Lord, who <lb/> had laid her on a bed of sickness, while <lb/> the other
						inmates of the house, were holding <lb/> their festive meetings in the
						adjoining <lb/> Prayer hall. For the visit paid to her, <lb/> and the prayer
						offered <add place="above">up</add> by her bedside <lb/> she expressed her
						thanks in a very <lb/> cordial and lively manner. Little <lb/> did the
						Minister think, that on his <lb/> return from Crook, whither duty called
						<lb/> him away for several days, he should <lb/> no longer be permitted to
						see her among <lb/> the living. To a fellow laborer, who <lb/> visited her
						late on Sunday Evening, <lb/> and who engaged in spiritual conversa <lb/>
