				<lg>
					<l>The Life of the S. Sr Sarah Cennick who went happily home Jany 24th 1770</l>
					<l>I was born June the 12th old Style 1712 in Reading Berks. </l>
					<l>wass baptiz&apos;d in the Church of England and brought up in that Comunion.</l>
					<l>The first thing I remember is the simple and happy intercourse I </l>
					<l>lived in with the Lord: I Knew he lov&apos;d me; and I lov &apos;d him; &amp; therefore</l>
					<l>used to have recourse to Him without the least reserve.</l>
					<l>When I was about 5 Years old, I remember to have been particularly</l>
					<l>naughty &amp; selfwilld, which caused me much heaviness, tho&apos; I strove all</l>
					<l>I could to divert and get rid of the Conviction by play &amp;c. But</l>
					<l>running hastily into my Mothers room, where she was sitting with</l>
					<l>my late dr Bror John then an Infant lying in her lap</l>
					<l>I saw her weeping with litted up hands, and heard her pray. I was</l>
					<l>much affected: But felt so hard, to acknowledge my fault, but</l>
					<l>upon repeatedly asking my Mother, why she cried and what she</l>
					<l>was saying? She referr&apos;d the Cause to me and said: &quot;I was praying</l>
					<l>for you and for your Brother.&quot; This pierc&apos;d me through, and I</l>
					<l>thought my heart would break. For I thought, The Lord also is</l>
					<l>greived! I therefore silently withdrew condemn&apos;d and asham&apos;d</l>
					<l>and hasted to a private Place, where with many Tears, I beged</l>
					<l>Him to forgive me; which he most graciously did directly, and</l>
					<l>all my Burthen instantly removed.</l>
					<l>My Father and his Relations being all Quakers of the</l>
					<l>most primitive sort, and my Mother and hers all strict Church</l>
					<l>of England; Her attachment to, and chief acquaintance were the</l>
					<l>Clergy; So that I had the Oppertunity of an intimate familiarity</l>
					<l>with each, not perceiving, at this time, the least disunion on either Side.</l>
					<l>Our Parish Vicar and his Family was a part of our</l>
					<l>most intimate acquaintance, and his Daughter, who had taken</l>
					<l>a liking to me from my Infancy, calling me her own Child,</l>
					<l>at last prevailed with my Parents, to take me more particularly</l>
					<l>home to her; But our houses Joining each other, I was nearly</l>
					<l>as much with my Parents as I was with them. This lady,</l>
					<l>taking me, to a friends house with her, I slip&apos;d out from</l>
					<l>the Company, and saw two small Boats fastened to the</l>
					<l>Landing Place in a deep Moat, I got into one of them</l>
					<l>and reached out of it to the Side of the other Boat.</l>
					<l>when both parting, and swiming from each other</l>
					<l>had dragged me out of that I stood in, had not the toes</l>
					<l>of my shoes hitch&apos;d in something, and prevented it.</l>
					<l>Thus hanging over the Water between both, I had</l>
					<l>scarce time to give my self up for lost, Before I Slip&apos;d</l>
					<l>my hold and pitched into the Water, where to my Joyfull</l>
					<l>surprise, instead of Sinking I found, as it were, Hands</l>

				<lg>
					<l>bearing so strong against my hands as to get and keep my head above</l>
					<l>water. Yea those kind Assistants bore me up so long, even till I was</l>
					<l>capable of taking hold with one Hand of that Boat, wherein, all </l>
					<l>while my shoes had hitch&apos;d, but how I recover&apos;d wholly, I never</l>
					<l>could remember, only that, as I came to my self, I was flat on</l>
					<l>my Back, safe and well. I know, who those ministers were, of</l>
					<l>whose kinder Orders they Obey&apos;d, and thanked them, and Him,</l>
					<l>Friend: beging Him 100 times over: O pray don&apos;t let it be found</l>
					<l>out &amp;c. Which, however remarkable, never was.</l>
					<l>I was this Gentlemans</l>
					<l>The parish vicar</l>
					<l>fond Companion also, and often</l>
					<l>Slid unobserv&apos;d to him, when he was retir&apos;d to private Devotion</l>
					<l>sometimes I kneel&apos;d behind, and at other times close by his side,</l>
					<l>that I might be a partaker of those influences, which I beleiv&apos;d,</l>
					<l>he enjoy&apos;d.</l>
					<l>As I Grew older, I had more liberty among the Servants,</l>
					<l>who endeavour&apos;d to seduce me and bring me into all manner of</l>
					<l>Wickedness, as much as they could, But finding me frighten&apos;d,</l>
					<l>and fearing I should tell, they threaten&apos;d me hard, what they</l>
					<l>would do to me, if I did. This brought me more particularly to my</l>
					<l>own Hearts Friend, and they let me alone for sometime; till one</l>
					<l>evening, I went into a back Garden, where a Company of them wo</l>
					<l>got, but I did not know nor think of them, till I was almost</l>
					<l>shock&apos;d to death, and could scarce stagger into door the House, when, even in</l>
					<l>the very Passage, the Lord met me, Comforted me, and gave me</l>
					<l>the Assurance in my Heart, &quot;He would preserve me for himself</l>
					<l>for ever.&quot; This Promise has always been a secret Comfort to me,</l>
					<l>all my Course through, yea even, when in the highest of my Folly</l>
					<l>in the World. I was near 8 years old, &amp; made a memorandum of that</l>
					<l>important Day. I was kept more close to my learning, and was</l>
					<l>instructed in all the Principles of the Church. I also got Courage</l>
					<l>to discover those notorious deceivers, without their knowing it was me</l>
					<l>Yet my Heart departed from its dearest Object, and I became as</l>
					<l>Formal and vain as any Body; I saw myself a fair Candidate</l>
					<l>for the World; but also, Ruin, Destruction, and eternal death</l>
					<l>stood as fair before me. This made me go on heavily, but I could</l>
					<l>tell no one: And as I was under Preparation for the H. Comn</l>
					<l>I was the more distress&apos;d; Sometimes in dispair and sometimes</l>
					<l>desperate. In this Situation I went to Evening Prayers, but I</l>
					<l>could neither pray, nor desire. I was so condemn&apos;d; But in the</l>
					<l>Begining of the last Prayers, my Heart became as melting Wax,</l>
					<l>and as such a Wretch I turn&apos;d again to my Friend, and begg&apos;d for mercy </l>
					<l>and got Confidence to trust and rely on him. I had sometime before</l>
					<l>privately made it out in my own mind, that, as Oppertunity should</l>
					<l>serve, I would privately retire to a Cloister, and in that especiall</l>
					<l>manner dedicate myself to the Lord Forever.</l>

				<lg>
					<l>In my 17th year it was thought proper by my Friends, that I should</l>
					<l>go to London for further Improvement. I was receiv&apos;d with the</l>
					<l>greatest heartiness, and every one was kindly officious in bringing </l>
					<l>me to public Places, and shewing me the Curiosities of the Town. I</l>
					<l>saw the Glory&apos;s of the Worlds - and loved it - and concluded, as I had</l>
					<l>often been told, I was made for the World, for it suited my Inclination</l>
					<l>and tast every way; And I had well nigh set through all Convictions,</l>
					<l>Though at the Bottom I had a Condemn&apos;d heart and guilty Conscience.</l>
					<l>My Mother being in London at this time took me with her, to see a</l>
					<l>Friend of hers in Bedlam, and surveying the many Shocking objects</l>
					<l>there, she tumed to me and said. &quot;This is the sad effect of Love and Pride.&quot;</l>
					<l>I made her no answere; but dispairingly thought: and this will</l>
					<l>one day be my unhappy Case unless God exert his Almighty</l>
					<l>Power in rescuing me. </l>
					<l>I soon followed my Mother privately to Reading giving all my</l>
					<l>Acquaintance the Slip; But was soon surrounded with my old</l>
					<l>Friends and Acquaintance who were very desireous to hear news, and</l>
					<l>learn more particularly the Fashions of the Town. I told them, I was</l>
					<l>quite tired of all those things, and therefore resolv&apos;d soon to retire from</l>
					<l>all, and come and live in a quite different way: If any of them where</l>
					<l>inclin&apos;d to make one of the Company, when I came to settle at home,</l>
					<l>it could be made out.</l>
					<l>From this time I had no rest for my poor distresst Heart &amp; mind</l>
					<l>Therefore in my 21st year I left London the Last time, to put in practice</l>
					<l>what I had so long purposed, renewing my Acquaintance with the</l>
					<l>most solid and religious Part of my Friends. I followed as near</l>
					<l>as I could. Step for step, with my Mother &amp; Brother, who had</l>
					<l>begun some time ago a more religious Course of Life; But, alas!</l>
					<l>I grew faint hearted and tir&apos;d: And seeing all my Works, Prayers</l>
					<l>and Duties, good for nothing at all, and I myself that same de-</l>
					<l>plorable Creature as ever I was, I cry&apos;d out in the Bitterness of</l>
					<l>my Soul: O Lord Jesus Christ&apos; if this is the way to Heaven, I shall</l>
					<l>never come there! My distress still increased, being more &amp; more</l>
					<l>Sensible of my Degeneracy; But above all did my base ingratitude</l>
					<l>to my once so tender Lover fill me with horror and Dejection. </l>
					<l>We had heard of the Awakening in Oxford, where my Br went,</l>
					<l>got acquainted with several, and brought Mr Kinchin to our house;</l>
					<l>and afterwards Mr Wesleys, Hutchins, Whitfield &amp;c. I was much</l>
					<l>perplex&apos;d in my own mind at this rash (as I thought then) proceeding</l>
					<l>of my Brothers, fearing a Schism in the Church. But being convinced</l>
					<l>of the truth of their Doctrine, was soon Zealously attached thereto.</l>
					<l>But the Preaching being in our House, it made a great stir in the</l>
					<l>Town, and caused us much Trouble and disgrace; So that my Mother</l>
					<l>hearing of it in London, came home, and put an intire Stop to it.</l>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Hereupon my Brother went to Bristoll, and I, and a well disposed singled</l>
					<l>Woman took a house in the Town; but the Preaching was given up.</l>
					<l>By these means got the ill Will of all my Friends and Relations</l>
					<l>My Acquaintance also shun&apos;d me, and every one&apos;s Face was set against</l>
					<l>me. Thus forsaken of all, and destitute of my best Friend, I grew</l>
					<l>dejected, and quite malancholy.</l>
					<l>In 1740 I visited Kingswood and Bristol; but could not be reconcil&apos;d</l>
					<l>to those Agitations among the Methodists at that time. Here I had</l>
					<l>happiness of seeing first our dr Bror Toellshig, who seeing my concern,</l>
					<l>help&apos;d me much. I soon return&apos;d to Reading exceedingly distress&apos;d,</l>
					<l>And finding my dear Companion so happy in our Savr and myself</l>
					<l>so wretched, I gave up all hopes of ever being sav&apos;d. But here in</l>
					<l>one moment did my most gracious Saviour reveal Himself to me,</l>
					<l>forgave me all my sin, and in an instant I was dispossess&apos;d of every</l>
					<l>Pain: I could hardly tell if I was in the Body or not. For my heart</l>
					<l>saw nothing but Jesus. I felt after Sin; but behold! there was</l>
					<l>no Sin. I felt after my own guilt and Distress, but there was</l>
					<l>no Place found for them, and nothing but light surrounded me. </l>
					<l>I had not enjoy&apos;d this happiness long, before my venerable Companion</l>
					<l>fell happily asleep on the Bosom of her eternal Bridegroom.</l>
					<l>At my return the former Disturbances were reviv&apos;d. many were</l>
					<l>distresst concerning their Salvation; And the Clergy being greatly</l>
					<l>perplex&apos;d, endeavour&apos;d to put me to Trouble; But our Saviour</l>
					<l>kept me stay&apos;d upon Him and deliver&apos;d me safe out of their Hands.</l>
					<l>I gave up my House, and went again to Kingswood, where Mr</l>
					<l>Whitfield, my Br and others were separated from Mr Wesleys, and</l>
					<l>had begun more regular Society, and gave me the care of the</l>
					<l>Single Women, with whom I labourd as well as I could;</l>
					<l>But knowing my own Insufficiency, and seeing many Irregularities</l>
					<l>creeping in among the Young People, I told my Bror this was not</l>
					<l>what suited me; and therefore I came to Reading, where a Widow</l>
					<l>Quaker Gentlewoman had long and often desir&apos;d I would stay with</l>
					<l>her and take use her House as my own. I did so, And all my Quaker</l>
					<l>Friends were exceeding kind to me, and earnestly wish&apos;d me to</l>
					<l>settle amongst them; I would have done it, but had no leave from</l>
					<l>our Savr in my own Heart. My Mind was secretly Hankering</l>
					<l>after a Cloister: But my Bror desiring my Assistance at</l>
					<l>Tetherton, I went to him, and with all the Money I had, Goods &amp;</l>
					<l>Furniture, engaged with him, and the Peace of God ruled &amp; rested</l>
					<l>upon us.</l>
					<l>In 44 I went on a Visit to London, where our late Sr Stonehouse</l>
					<l>brought me aquainted with my ever dearest Anna Johanna, with</l>
					<l>whom my Heart was tenderly united, as was hers to me.</l>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>I had heard of the Order among the Single Sisters, and that it was</l>
					<l>something like a Nunery, which exacted my enquiry and I wish&apos;d once</l>
					<l>to see such a Choir. My Bror had already contracted a large Acquaintance</l>
					<l>with the Brethren, and sometime after gave our Societies into their</l>
					<l>care and went on a Visit to Hhaag, and from thence to Ireland.</l>
					<l>In his Absence I had the favour of a Visit at Tetherton from our late</l>
					<l>dr Disciple and Discipless, Christel, Anna Johanna &amp;c. The Discipless</l>
					<l>was particularly hearty with me to, whom, at first, I was somewhat</l>
					<l>reserved; But coming upon Heart Matters, I was quite openhearted,</l>
					<l>and she spoke to me in the most Comfortable and encouraging manner,</l>
					<l>telling me, how tenderly She and her Company felt towards me, and</l>
					<l>assuring me of our Saviours Thoughts of Peace concerning me.</l>
					<l>My Brother soon after return&apos;d, who told me yet more about the</l>
					<l>single Sisrs, and how earnestly he had Pray&apos;d our Savr to bring me </l>
					<l>into their happy Circle, That he knew it was just a Regulation as</l>
					<l>would please me. Upon duly weighing the matter before our Savr, I wrote</l>
					<l>to my much respected Friend, the dr Discipless for leave to visit the Congn</l>
					<l>in Germany, who readily granted me the favour. My Mother also</l>
					<l>at this time, was well inclin&apos;d towards to Bren; But meeting with</l>
					<l>some unhpy Circumstances, she was turn&apos;d quite against them: And</l>
					<l>tho&apos; I was much Staggered, yet our Savr preserved me, and gave me Courage</l>
					<l>of persevere in my Purpose. Yet I had it hard to get away, and was forc&apos;d</l>
					<l>to leave her against her Will.</l>
					<l>In March 1747 I arrived with many more English Brethen and</l>
					<l>Sisrs together with Br &amp; Sis Teltschig in Hhaag, where I met with</l>
					<l>the most cordial reception from our dr Disciple &amp; Discipless.</l>
					<l>The Congregation and its regulations I saw with wonder and delight;</l>
					<l>Especially that of the S. Sisrs. My first Intention only was to Visit</l>
					<l>the Congn, and not to become a Member thereof; But in London, on my</l>
					<l>way hither, being a Spectator at the Holy Communion, I was so affected</l>
					<l>that I forgott my Resolution; Till by Occasion, soon after my arrival,</l>
					<l>I grew Suspicious, till I was quite confus&apos;d. But having an unreserved</l>
					<l>Confidence to the late dr Discipless, I told her all my Concern, who</l>
					<l>with the greatest tenderness &amp; Frankness clear&apos;d up those matters which</l>
					<l>had given me so much pain. I now became quite happy and saw</l>
					<l>the Congn in a right light, and the Beginning of that happy Period,</l>
					<l>which the H Ghost had so many years been preparing me for.</l>
					<l>I had the Grace to be received into the Congregation the same year,</l>
					<l>Was soon after Confirm&apos;d and in Jan 1748 was made a happy Partaker</l>
					<l>of the Lords Body and Blood in the H Communion. Here also I</l>
					<l>had the Grace to be admitted into the Class of Intercessors, and soon</l>
					<l>after set out with Br &amp; Sr Boehler &amp;c. for England. Our Dr Papa,</l>
					<l>Mamma, the Mother, Anna Johanna &amp;c. accompanied us to Francfort,</l>

					<l>where, after many Blessings, the rest day we proceeded on our Journey</l>
					<l>in the Peace of God, and blessing of the Congregation.</l>
					<l>After staying sometime in London, I was sent to Fulneck, where</l>
					<l>I was one of the Congn Servants, Choir Servant &amp; Helper. In June</l>
					<l>1750 I was called to London, where I enjoy&apos;d many blessings in the</l>
					<l>Dear Disciples House in Bloomsbury Square. From whence I</l>
					<l>was sent to Dublin to have the Care of the S. Sisrs There and in the</l>
					<l>north of Ireland. The same year I visited the North, and the Year</l>
					<l>after was sent there; where also, as in Dublin our Savr accom-</l>
					<l>panied, blessed and prosper&apos;d me, gave me the Hearts of the Sisters,</l>
					<l>for whom I have ever retained the tenderest affection, and shall</l>
					<l>to my latest Breath. So that, notwithstanding the many heavy</l>
					<l>Circumstances, I enjoy &apos;d the still Communion with my Hearts</l>
					<l>best Friend; Nor were my many Faults, weaknesses and mistakes</l>
					<l>a hindrence thereto. </l>
					<l>In Septr 1758 I got a Call to the Disciple House, from my</l>
					<l>dear Anna Johanna. And the 19th arriv&apos;d Sr Mary, Sr Ripley </l>
					<l>and Matty Haley, who were most heartily receiv&apos;d by all, and</l>
					<l>especially by our own dr little Choir in Ballunderry. </l>
					<l>The 30th Sr Mary Spoke the Sisrs to the Comn and in the Afternoon</l>
					<l>we partook of the same. Particular meetings were appointed</l>
					<l>in all the Plans for the Reception of the above two Sisters, which</l>
					<l>with other meetings and matters lasted to the 18th of Octr when we</l>
					<l>viz: Br Watson, Sr. Mary, Margt Graham a Widow, myself,</l>
					<l>My dear little Neice Betsey Cennick, and Betsey Mortimer,</l>
					<l>set off from Ballunderry, and came to Bellfast the same evening</l>
					<l>where we were detain&apos;d till the 24th when in our way down</l>
					<l>to the Vessel Sr Mary got a sad fall; we got on board however</l>
					<l>the same evening. On the 27th a Voilent Storm arose and</l>
					<l>we were given up for lost. this was a trying Circumstance</l>
					<l>to me, after I had gone through so many trials before; But</l>
					<l>I immediately turn&apos;d to my best and only Friend, thought perhaps</l>
					<l>I was the Jonas and therefore became a sinner before Him on all</l>
					<l>accounts, and in 5 minutes all were well between Him and</l>
					<l>me, and my heart rejoice&apos;d that I should so soon see him. the WWd</l>
					<l>of the Day was. Rom. 14, 8. &quot;Wether we live, we live unto the Lord,</l>
					<l>or wether we die, we die unto the Lord.&quot;</l>
					<l>&quot;Must a ling&apos;ring Death await us, This Text ever will stand Good:</l>
					<l>He in Glory to translate us, Purchas&apos;d all Things by his Blood.&quot;</l>
					<l>The 28th we got among the sandbanks. The 29 we landed in </l>
					<l>Liver Pool safe and well. Novr the 2d we came to Fulneck abt</l>
					<l>4 o&apos;Clock. After Tea Sr Hendrengen took care of the Children,</l>

					<l>And in the evening Sr Mary sent to invite me into her house, where</l>
					<l>I enjoy &apos;d many Blessings; till in Jan. 59 Br &amp; Sisr. Houptmann</l>
					<l>received their Call to Bedford, I embrace&apos;d this Oppertunity of going</l>
					<l>with them from hence to that Place, where I was receiv&apos;d with the</l>
					<l>greatest love and heartiness. I soon went to London, when, after</l>
					<l>waiting along while, and meeting with many hindrences, however</l>
					<l>on the 7th of May I arrived with several more Brethern &amp; Sisters</l>
					<l>to my exceeding great Joy, having that long wish&apos;d for happiness</l>
					<l>of seeing my dear Papa, Mamagen and Anna Johanna once more.</l>
					<l>The 10 th I was brought to Annenhoff, where I enjoy&apos;d many inexpressible</l>
					<l>Blessings. The 14th I was receiv&apos;d as Acoluth and ordained a Deaconess. </l>
					<l>Here I had the favour of Staying till the Close thereof, a time,</l>
					<l>I shall never forget. July the 17th I set out from Zeist with the</l>
					<l>respectable Br &amp; Sr Heinrichs von Reuss &amp; Salome Gross came to</l>
					<l>Gnadenthal August the 3d the 11th to Kleinwelke, &amp; the 12th to Hhuth,</l>
					<l>where I enjoy&apos;d a real Sabatic season, Continuing in the most</l>
					<l>tender Comunion with my eternal Friends; and in heartiest</l>
					<l>Fellowship with all. At the latter end of this year our dear</l>
					<l>Disciple House arrived to the universal great joy of all here; I</l>
					<l>had the Blessing of being present at the S. Sisrs Synod to the end;</l>
					<l>as also at that memorable Conclusion of the faithfull Labour of those</l>
					<l>two eminent Witnesses the dr Disciple &amp; Disciples of Jesus in May 1760.</l>
					<l>That Peace of God, which came more espeically upon the</l>
					<l>Congn at that time, I also partook of in a particular manner</l>
					<l>In which happy Sensation I left Hhuth Sept the 4th with Br &amp; Sr </l>
					<l>Teltschig and came to Kleinwelke; the 9th to Barby; there I</l>
					<l>enjoy&apos;d many particular Blessings. The 13th we proceeded</l>
					<l>on our Journey, and came to Zeist on the 19th. From thence we</l>
					<l>came to London Octr the 6th, And the 13th I came to Bedford, where</l>
					<l>I was receiv&apos;d most heartily and it went blessedly for a time, but</l>
					<l>afterwards not so; Therefore I was sent to  Lembster to</l>
					<l>Br &amp; Sr Rice to have the Care of some young Women, Collected</l>
					<l>from several Parts, there being only two Natives. As to outward</l>
					<l>Circumstances it was morally impossible to come thro&apos; in a manner</l>
					<l>suitable to an Oeconomy; But the principle thing in the whole</l>
					<l>was the want of hearts, and the true Spirit of Love and Harmony</l>
					<l>amongs&apos;t us all. I shall not enter into Farther Particulars,</l>
					<l>They being of too painfull a nature.</l>
					<l>In Novr. 1764 I receiv&apos;d a Call from the General Synod at</l>

					<l>Sisr Mary Voglsng in Caring for the S. Sisters and Great Girls of</l>
					<l>the Country Congns. I receiv&apos;d my Call with awe &amp; real bow-</l>
					<l>edness of heart. I wrote to Sr Mary on that account, who answer&apos;d</l>
					<l>me as a Priestess of God. In Decr. I set out with a Br. and his</l>
					<l>Daughter a great Girl, who had lived with me, for ockbrook,</l>
					<l>where she was to reside. We arrived there safe and well after</l>
					<l>a heavy Journey, and I stay&apos;d to refresh myself for several days</l>
					<l>among my old Acquaintance and then set out for Fulneck.</l>
					<l>On the 21st Decr. I came to Leeds where our late Br Shultze was</l>
					<l>waiting to bring me to Fulneck the next Day, and presented me</l>
					<l>with a very hearty Congratulatory Letter from my Dr Sisr Mary</l>
					<l>We arrived at Fulneck abt Noon on the 22d and met with a</l>
					<l>very hearty Reception from all my dr old S. Sisters, and stay&apos;d</l>
					<l>till the 16th of Jan; when I was brought to Gumersall Oeconomy be</l>
					<l>Sr Mary and Ann Birkby. I felt well as soon as I enterd the</l>
					<l>House. Early the next morning the two above mentioned Sisrs</l>
					<l>took their leave of us. I got alone into my little room and</l>
					<l>kept a hearty Band with my Best Friend, and with many </l>
					<l>tears devoted myself afresh to him: Put Him in mind of his</l>
					<l>Promise viz: That He would once bring me into an</l>
					<l>Asylum, where I should enjoy a real Sabatic sea-</l>
					<l>son and Bridal Intercourse with Him, preparatory</l>
					<l>to his taking me into His arms and Bosom.</l>
					<l>He shewed me something more concerning my present call, than I</l>
					<l>found, Some others knew, and was to remain a sceeret between Him</l>
					<l>and me, I soon found myself at Home, and that he would bring</l>
					<l>me safely thro&apos;.  I felt also that the Hearts of the Sisrs were tenderly</l>
					<l>inclin&apos;d towards me; so that we soon became one Heart and one</l>
					<l>Mind, and a Blessed Period commence&apos;d, tho&apos; under many Difficulties.</l>
					<l>Not long after, a certain Sabbatic mood and most intimat inter-</l>
					<l>course, between me and my Friend took Place; So that my</l>
					<l>Labour among the Souls, was my Delight, it per adventure</l>
					<l>I might happily gain some, to become lovers of this my so favourite</l>
					<l>Object. My Journeys were long and heavy, to go to the different</l>
					<l>Congns, and I being very weakly made me oft secretly sigh and weep be</l>
					<l>fore my Friend: For it being just the depth of the winter that I come here,</l>
					<l>made walking in those bad roads almost impracticable; But here I must</l>
					<l>mention with the greatest gratitude &amp; humility the more then</l>
					<l>Brotherly &amp; Sisterly love and Faithfullness of my good, old,</l>
					<l>venerable Hearts Watsons; Happy for me they were at this time</l>

					<l>living here in Gumersall, and had the Care of Wyke Plan also, they</l>
					<l>therefore most Chearfully help&apos;d me always, when, and where they</l>
					<l>could with their horse &amp;c. In Decr following, we had the misfortune</l>
					<l>to loose them; For they went to Mirfield: Here also they faithfully</l>
					<l>assisted me in every respect, and that same genuin look &amp; heartiness</l>
					<l>still subsisting between us especially my good Sr Watson our hearts</l>
					<l>became joined and united in the heart of our wounded Friend, To be</l>

					<l>My little Room has been a Cabinet of Jewels to me, Therefore I have</l>
					<l>long concluded, that if our Savr took me home here in Yorkshire, I</l>
					<l>would die in my nest, and so slip away, as it were incognito</l>
					<l>Since our dr Brn Boehlor&apos;s Visitation here, our Family has been</l>
					<l>brought again into the injoyment of our Choir Graces with our Choir</l>
					<l>to our very great abasement.</l>
					<l>For this Year last past, I have felt that my time was out</l>
					<l>in Gumersal, and last summer thought I should get a Call after</l>
					<l>the Synod; but could never find out any Place where I could be sent</l>
					<l>to. I once kept a hearty Band with my Friend about it, at the</l>
					<l>Conclusion of which, and summing up the whole, I said to Him:</l>
					<l>&quot;Now would it not be better thou tookst me home to thy own dr self.&quot;</l>
					<l>I had no room to suspect any thing of the kind, from what I felt from him</l>
					<l>at that time; But July last, As I was in the Chaple Garden at Work, He drew near</l>
					<l>To me in an extraordinary manner, and discover&apos;d to me Such an Union</l>
					<l>&amp; oneness between Him &amp; me, as is altogether unutterable, tho&apos; I </l>
					<l>did attempt to express something of it in a few Verses.</l>
					<l>From this time I had often gentle hints of a Change, of something that would</l>
					<l>take place, which should entirely suit me.</l>
					<l>In August last I got it Voilent Cold, which grew worse &amp; worse,</l>
					<l>And found my Lungs were infected. In the Beginning of Sept last,</l>
					<l>I felt myself strangly ill; so as I had never been before, which lasted</l>
					<l>some few nights &amp; days; And during the whole time, I was most happily</l>
					<l>Comforted with my Friends nearness, Insomuch that I felt no illness at all,</l>
					<l>only that I was weak and drowsy. One night, unasked for, He</l>
					<l>came Close to my Bedside, and stood there. My Heart saw Him,</l>
					<l>And my Soul adored Him! He dispersed intirely in a moment</l>
					<l>every painfull thought and Sensation, inwardly and outwardly</l>
					<l>I felt after one Wound and another sore; But behold! they were all</l>
					<l>healed. I felt after Sin, and there was no sin. I felt after misery</l>
					<l>and Dejection, But there was none to be found; And thus I was made</l>
					<l>sound and whole, except those pleasing Wounds of Love, which He</l>
					<l>had made long before in my enamour&apos;d Heart, But now more</l>
					<l>Deeply impress&apos;d.</l>
					<l>Now it was, He gave me, the soft impression of his Gracious</l>
					<l>intention Concerning me; while I silently worship&apos;d before Him.</l>
					<l>On the 26th my dr Sr Lorel called on us in her return from</l>
					<l>Duckenfield, and was quite alarm&apos;d at my seeming bad state</l>
					<l>of Health, would not rest, But insisted on my going to Fulneck,</l>
					<l>To stay there for some time which I did; where I assisted in</l>
					<l>seeing the Sisters for the Communion, and could not forbear to </l>
					<l>drop a word now and then concerning something, the very obscure of</l>
					<l>my happy Situation.  On the 9th I return&apos;d to Gummersal, where</l>
					<l>my Disorder increased, And my Friend confirmed more </l>

				<lg>
					<l>Strongly what he had made allready manifest to me. I was very well</l>
					<l>seemingly, fix&apos;d and suited; But my dr. Sr Lorel could not be reconcil&apos;d</l>
					<l>to my staying at Gumersel, and I must own shew&apos;d more then Mothers</l>
					<l>Faithfulness and Affection: In these Circumstances she could not be</l>
					<l>prevailed upon to be Satisfy&apos;d, unless I came to Fulneck.</l>
					<l>I therefore set out in mere faith, with Br Samuel Fowler and</l>
					<l>Joseph Peal Novr. 20th 1769 and arriv&apos;d here safe, and meet with a very</l>
					<l>hearty Reception. The first dr Heart which saluted me, was</l>
					<l>my most dear and venerable Heart Anna Johanna; I was also made</l>
					<l>happily sensable of that genuine Love and hearty affection of the</l>
					<l>Choir in general, And more especially from all those in Office; so that</l>
					<l>that peace of God, and that Sabbath, which I never had heard any</l>
					<l>one possessing, at least so long before their Departure, accompanied</l>
					<l>me here also in the clearest manner, which begun at the time above</l>
					<l>mentioned, when our Savr manifested Himself to me in such an</l>
					<l>especiall manner. But here I must mention some essential</l>
					<l>things, which I forgot to mention in their proper places, viz.</l>
					<l>After all that the Lord had done for me, and I was clear and well</l>
					<l>establish&apos;d in it: One Day, as He &amp; I were solacing ourselves in</l>
					<l>each others love, it came into my mind; But that oneness &amp; union</l>
					<l>which I had possessed in Him. I was not so clear in at this time: He</l>
					<l>shew&apos;d me, I was wholly in Him and He in me, and that we</l>
					<l>were One as he and the Father are One. I saw myself cloathed</l>
					<l>upon in Him, and possessed of all the Bridal Ornaments of the Bridegroom. </l>
					<l>I must therefore ascribe all the Honour and Glory alone to my own dr.</l>
					<l>eternal Slaughter&apos;d Lord and Saviour  and conclude my</l>
					<l>Narrative with the Greatest truth in all the World: viz.</l>
					<l>That, Where Sin hath abounded, Grace hath abounded</l>
					<l>Much more.</l>
					<l>Our venerable and Happily departed Sisr Sarah Cennick,</l>
					<l>Has in some measure Specify&apos;d How varioussly her Election of Grace</l>
					<l>has been manifested where-ever her happy Lot Has been cast, during</l>
					<l>Her Course through this vale of tears.</l>
					<l>Her Strong Capacity, Great Gifts, and quick sensations, was</l>
					<l>Iluminated by such extraordinary Grace from the H. Ghost</l>
					<l>As evidently Signalized Her a peculiar Person of Blessed</l>
					<l>remembrance to the Hearts of many Souls.</l>
					<l>Yet amidst all those great Endowments, she had the</l>
					<l>Happiness, through the infinite Mercys of God, to be throughty</l>
					<l>Convinced of her great depravity in Soul and Body, and</l>
					<l>which truly as a monument of uncommon Mercy and Grace, </l>
					<l>was preserved, in her Earlyest years, From the dangers and</l>
					<l>vain Foibels of her natural Inclinations, and as her own</l>
					<l>words has spoke it, she counted it the highest Dignity</l>

					<l>Gumersall, At our desire she remov&apos;d to end her days in the </l>
					<l>midst of her Choir at Fulneck, yet she retained the same Love</l>
					<l>and Concern, for her dear Gumersall Sisrs, to whom we</l>
					<l>perceiv&apos;d on all Occassions, she had the tenderest attachment</l>
					<l>And her hearts Connexion with the Fountain of Love defus&apos;d it</l>
					<l>self thro&apos; the whole Choir. For notwithstanding her great</l>
					<l>weakness, she desir&apos;d to see the Sisrs Room by Room, took a</l>
					<l>most tender and solemn farewell of them all; Like wise Little</l>
					<l>Moore &amp; Gumersall Oeconomies, The Latter of which, she desir&apos;d</l>
					<l>to see once again, when her Dissolution was perceptably hastening,</l>
					<l>which was a most moving scene, To Behold and feel with what power</l>
					<l>and grace, she gave her last Benediction to that dear Oeconomy</l>
					<l>Where she had finishe&apos; her faithfull Labour in this broken Kingdom</l>

					<l>Here Below. And blest each with impossion of hands in the most</l>
					<l>maternal and feeling manner.</l>
					<l>From this time her weakness increas&apos;d more sensibly, which</l>
					<l>Excited a more Eager desire to see her Class, which Oppertunity was</l>
					<l>most thankfully embraced to have once more a LFeast with her,</l>
					<l>And her aspect testify&apos;d what her heart injoy&apos;d on this Occasion to</l>
					<l>have the great priviledge to declare in our midst, that the Peace</l>
					<l>of God our Saviour, was so preceptably felt to rule and preside</l>
					<l>By one Spirit among&apos;st us, to the Great Comfort and astonishment</l>
					<l>Of her heart, which she confess&apos;d met her at the first entrance</l>
					<l> at our Doors. She pray&apos;d fervently, that this Peace and blessed Harmony</l>
					<l>in our Choir, and particularly in this her Class, might daily increase &amp;</l>
					<l>Prosper to the Honour of his holy name, and the Blessing on the whole</l>
					<l>Choir, which made a latting impression on all present; And at the</l>
					<l>Close took a most Affecting leave, and like a Handmaid and Priestess</l>
					<l>of God, sencerely recommended her fellow Helper Lorel Seidel to the</l>
					<l>Special blessing of the Lord in her future Course &amp; Labour in the Choir.</l>
					<l>The 23 in the evening she Complain&apos;d of a pain in her Side, but had</l>
					<l>a Tolerable good night, and took her Breakfast in the Moming, with</l>
					<l>More relish then usual, but felt very weary.</l>
					<l>About 9 o&apos;Clock on Sr Lorels entering the Room she call&apos;d</l>
					<l>Her to her bedside, And with uncommon firmness of mind said Lorel</l>
					<l>this very day. I&apos;m determin&apos;d to go home and repeated it again with</l>
					<l>the greatest fervency, Saying, I have been speaking with my</l>
					<l>Friend about it, See to it, that you have my mansion ready</l>
					<l>(the Corpses Chamber), and then was still for some moments, a Sister</l>
					<l>Continuing by her Bedside whom she ask&apos;d, what she was reading</l>
					<l>so devotly in Her Countenance. The Sisr Answer&apos;d, it&apos;s the near</l>
					<l>Approaches of your Desolution, which engages my attention in</l>
					<l>an unutterable manner. She smiling made no answer and</l>
					<l>remained still for some time, and then ask&apos;d, what it was that</l>
					<l>she now perceiv&apos;d come with a little noise from her Breast said</l>
					<l>is it Death! answer&apos;d by the Sister I beleive it is, then she haistyly</l>
					<l>reply&apos;d, Pray then call Lorel. At whose entrance into the</l>
					<l>Room, she fixt her eyes upon her and said, Dont took so anxious</l>
					<l>This Ruttling in my Breast is no pain to me, I am quite easy</l>
					<l>and shall very soon be with him, in whose heart centers all my wishes. </l>
					<l>She retain&apos;d a Srong presence of Mind, and during her</l>
					<l>Whole Sickness to her last Moments, was Carried on with remarkable</l>
					<l>Serinity and ease, Traceing many intimations from some</l>
					<l>Months past of her Gracious Lords intentions with her</l>
					<l>By this sickness, And that no pains should interrupt that</l>

					<l>Sweet Comunion that her Soul injoy&apos;d with its Beloved Bridegroom</l>
					<l>Which was truly verify&apos;d to the end.</l>
					<l>About an Hour before she departed it was perceivd her</l>
					<l>Lips moved very quick, beleiving she call&apos;d some one by name,</l>
					<l>On being ask&apos;d if it was so, she reply&apos;d it&apos;s possibly. But I </l>
					<l>was conversing with my Friend and lover: Continuing in this</l>
					<l>way about 3 quarters of an hour, And then wanted very much</l>
					<l>To Speak, Her Faltering Tongue could no more be understood</l>
					<l>only Christ &amp; Cry &amp;c. a few moments would now end the Period</l>
					<l>of her time, upon which Sr. Lorel laid her hand upon her head</l>
					<l>and she look&apos;d once more up. And then Closs&apos;d her eyes to Sleep</l>
					<l>in the Arms of her everlasting Bridegroom. during</l>
					<l>The Blessing of her Choir, with a most powerfull feeling of</l>
					<l>Grace, from the sensible near presence of our dearest Lord,</l>
					<l>Which will never be forgotten by those who had the favour</l>
					<l>To be present, at this important Event</l>
					<l>Her Corpes had a most lovly Aspect. She has spent in this</l>
					<l>Dying Life 57 Years, 7 Months, and some Days.</l>
