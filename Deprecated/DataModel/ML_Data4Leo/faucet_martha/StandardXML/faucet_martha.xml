					<l>Martha Fawset was born in Wike in the year 1751</l>
					<l>May y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and Baptized June y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> at Scholes by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Latrobe</l>
					<l>She was a Child that from her earlist years took great delight in learning</l>
					<l>Verses and this was one great reason why she had such pleasure in</l>
					<l>going to the Childrens School which was at that time kept by Sister</l>
					<l>Betty Holdaworth she had a perticular love for her insomuch that when</l>
					<l>the Sister went away it cost her many Tears, in the time of her going to</l>
					<l>School the had two Fitts, but grow better, in the year 1763 March</l>
					<l>the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> she was taken into the great Girls Choir which was a new</l>
					<l>School to her she was of a very lively dispossion which when she</l>
					<l>began to feel a little of her self she was some times concernd about</l>
					<l>it and one night in perticular she wept to her Mother and</l>
					<l>said she wish&apos;d it cou&apos;d be made possable for her to go and live</l>
					<l>some were among the Sisters, her Mother comforted her telling her it</l>
					<l>wou&apos;d be made possible and that she shou&apos;d only give her Heart to</l>
					<l>our Saviour and she wou&apos;d take care about that, and thus for the </l>
					<l>present she was made satisfy&apos;d, the first time after that she</l>
					<l>came to Fulneck she desird her Labrous to give her leave to go </l>
					<l>and live at the little Oeconomy with the Sister Mary Wight </l>
					<l><add place="above">soon after</add> she was rejoiced with the News that she had</l>
					<l>now leave to go and live with them Sisters where upon she went</l>
					<l>with great Satisfaction Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 30 1765 and became soon satis</l>
					<l>fy&apos;d and quite at home and was very chearfull among the Sisters</l>
					<l>there tho&apos; her uncommon lively turn some times occasiond the Sisters </l>
					<l>to reprove her yet not with standing it was very perceptable that </l>
					<l>that she had some times very serious reflections, one time in </l>
					<l>perticular as the sisters was conversing together in aband like way</l>
					<l>she put the question to them if they thought that the Angels had</l>
					<l>the same share in our Saviours redemtion as the human </l>

					<l>Creature had, and when they answerd her that he did not dye</l>
					<l>for the Angels for they was not fallen as we was for they was</l>
					<l>no sinners, and when they repeated that verse.</l></lg></p>
					<p><lg>
					<l>Glory be unto that heart so bloody that I poor and sinfull</l>
					<l>thing, Not adapted to an Angles body But a human with its</l>
					<l>Sting Go on smelling tasting feeling gaping ye she was almost</l>
					<l>as in an Extasy, some time after it was percievd that she began</l>
					<l>to be more thought full and woud say do let us give our Selves</l>
					<l>entirely up to our Saviour and then we shall all be happy</l>
					<l>and she began to have great pleasure in going to her bands</l>
					<l>and clases and all her ohoer opertunitys which otherway she</l>
					<l>according to her own declareation us&apos;d to have a little fear for</l>
					<l>because she found that with all she still got not such an</l>
					<l>intire heart as our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and her Labroures cou&apos;d have wish&apos;d</l>
					<l>her, but in this respect she became quite alter&apos;d for she hard</l>
					<l>ly coud wait the time when she was to go to her choir meeting</l>
					<l>at Fulneck and many time as she returnd home with the Sisters</l>
					<l>she us&apos;d to say O I wish I coud always feel as I do on those days</l>
					<l>I always think that I will give every thing to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> but </l>
					<l>yet my lightmindedness comes again but yet for all that </l>
					<l>I know I am our Saviours and he will accept me just so as</l>
					<l>I am the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of March being Congregation day in Fulneck</l>
					<l>she with the rest of the Sisters went to the same and got such</l>
					<l>an impression there from that she never lost and when it</l>
					<l>was given out that the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> and Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> would soon recive the Acts of the </l>
					<l>Son of Man she not have a right undersanding what was said</l>
					<l>she understood that our Saviour was soon to come which put </l>
					<l>her in such uncommon joy that she hadly knew how to contain </l>

					<l>her self and simply told her thoughts to the Sisters and how she</l>
					<l>felt about it soon after she begun to complain that she felt</l>
					<l>such but did not think that her dessolution was so near but</l>
					<l>she grew worse and worse that we at last coud think no other</l>
					<l>ways then that our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> woud soon take her to him self her</l>
					<l>disorder began to grow very strong on her tho&apos; as long as she</l>
					<l>was able she she did not keep her bed she was often heard</l>
					<l>speaking when alone with our Saviour and tho&apos; she her</l>
					<l>self did not think that he woud <add place="above">so</add> soon take her to himself</l>
					<l>yet she was heard some time saying to him thy will be done</l>
					<l>she at last began to grow very weak but to the very last </l>
					<l>she never kept her bed the day before her desolution it was</l>
					<l>perceptable that she woud not continue long the Sister that</l>
					<l>waited on her ask&apos;d her if she felt our Saviour near her</l>
					<l>and if she did not think that <add place="above">he would soo fetch her</add> <hi rend="strikethrough">she soon go to him</hi> to which</l>
					<l>she answerd that she desird him often to let her feel his </l>
					<l>nearness and that if it pleasd him to take her to him self</l>
					<l>that he woud not delay the time too long the Morning after </l>
					<l>she desird that her Labrous might be fetch&apos;d and as the Sister</l>
					<l>who waited on her was going to call one of the Sisters to her</l>
					<l>she heard her speak to our Saviour but coud not tell any thing</l>
					<l>she said when she came to her she percievd she was departing</l>
					<l>and to our great suprise she got her last kiss and thus was </l>
					<l>her joy now compleated in him whom she so desird having liv&apos;d</l>
					<l>in this dying life 15 years 99 Weeks</l>
