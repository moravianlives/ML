      <p><a href="#mlper000565.html">A. E. Marychurch</a> <br />     After a careful search through my dear<br />Sisters papers I regret to say, that we <br /> have been unable to find any distinct
         <br /> memory of her past life, there are various <br /> short diaries written even in a very early <br /> period of her life containing statements <br /> of deep religious feeling, and even
         spirit <br /> ual experience, but she seems to have <br /> shrunk from the last of compiling <br /> any thing like a regular memoir. <br /> What she declined to do for herself from <br /> a
         feeling a rising probably from her ex <br /> treme humility her brother and her <br /> friends have endeavoured in some de <br /> gree to supply. Her life was not crowd <br /> ed with
         exciting events, yet it was <br /> one of unusual usefulness, and her <br /> energies became more active as her <br /> bodily strength declined; her light shone <br /> more &amp; more until
         she reached the <br /> perfect day. <a href="#mlper000565.html">Ann Elizabeth Marychurch</a><br /> was born<em>Sep<sup>tr</sup> 24<sup>th</sup> 1804</em> &amp; was baptized <br /> in the <a
            href="#mlpla000030.html">Brethrens Church in Bristol</a><br /> Thus her earthly course began in that </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p>Church which she loved through <br /> life more than any other
         portion <br /> of <a href=".html">Gods</a> heritage, she enbibid its spirit <br /> in early childhood and cherished it <br /> to the last. Her parents were esteemed<br /> members of the
         Congregation &amp; her <br /> Father was for many years, most <br /> faithfully zealous and active in pro <br /> moting its interests. On the mater <br /> nal side, her Grandmother was one
         <br /> of the first members when the Congre <br /> gation was settled in <em>1755</em>. She was <br /> brought up by a very affectionate and <br />tender mother who trained her early <br />
         in the ways of Gods people. In due <br /> time she was sent to school, but her <br /> School days were not happy, she <br />suffered much from those peculiar <br /> school troubles which are
         often very <br /> keenly felt by young sensitive child <br /> ren, - speaking of her school days <br /> she once said I was a poor little timid<br /> thing and the unkind ridicule <br /> of
         some of the older girls made me </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p>very unhappy, and pressed down my <br /> spirits, so that my childhood was not <br /> so happy as it might have been. <br /> Her mother being
         an invalid, she became <br /> very early useful in the family and <br /> the active habits which were thus <br /> formed continued through life. <br /> In <em>1821</em>she was confirmed by
         the <a href="#mlper000703.html">Rev<sup>d </sup><br /> D<sup>r.</sup> Okely</a> the minister of the Congrega <br /> tion and in <em>1822</em>she became a received <br /> member. A dangerous
         illness had excit <br /> edSolemn thought &amp; made her feel it <br /> right to take these important steps <br /> but had not at that time received any <br />deep religious impressions, she
         had not <br /> as yet felt the burden of sin, nor the <br />inescpressible love of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>. She was in- <br /> deed faithful in prayer and had ear <br /> nestdesires that
         every thought should <br /> be brought into captivity to <a href=".html">Christ</a>. She <br /> often retired for prayer, and she wrote <br /> out a solemndedication of herself to <br /> her
         Saviour, but her heart was not yet <br /> decided and she could not yet say </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p>Lord I will follow thee whither so ever <br /> thou goeth. But the Holy Spirit led her <br />
         into clearer views of her own ruined state <br /> by nature, her sinfulness &amp; depravity in <br /> the sight of <a href=".html">God</a>, and often it later years <br /> did she bemoan
         herself almost in the <br /> language of <a href=".html">St. Paul</a>, "O wretched man <br /> that I am who shall deliver me from <br /> the body of this death." This deep convic <br /> tion
         of the corruption of her heart com <br /> bined at times with what she deplored <br /> as a natural tendency to sceptism<br /> frequently robbed her soul of the peace<br /> to be found in
         simply looking to the <br /> blood &amp; righteousness of <a href=".html">Christ</a> as the <br /> sinners only hope. It was once of her <br /> greatest sources of disquietude amount <br />
         ing at times to distracting torment, <br /> that <a href=".html">Satan</a> was permitted to infuse <br />doubts into her mind of those great <br /> and sacred truths which she
         cherished<br />most dearly. </p>
      <p> Possibly her active intellect aided the <br />temptation. But he who permitted it </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> made a way to escape. Her harrased <br /> mind sought comfort in the word <br />of <a
            href=".html">God</a> &amp; in prayer; and through the <br />Holy Spirits help she became established <br /> strengthened &amp; settled in the faith. Still <br /> through life she at times
         complained<br /> of her hardness of heart &amp; slowness to <br /> believe was "her thorn in the flesh" often <br /> producing poignantdistress, but like <br /><a href=".html">St Paul</a> she
         heard the voice of comfort<br /> saying, "My Grace is sufficient for thee" <br /> There were however times especially at <br /> the Holy Comnmunion when she realized <br /> the saving love of
         her Lord, &amp; when her <br />heart was filled with rapture &amp; joy<br /> Thus as life progressed she obtained <br /> deeper spiritual experience -- her faith <br /> was not a dead faith,
         but brought <br /> forth good fruit. It led her to work <br /> to work heartily in the Lords service. <br /> Her natural energy of character would <br /> not allow her to rest in inactivity
         <br /> She felt religion to be a vital matter <br /> and she became anxious to communicate </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> it. In her early with she was a zealous<br />Sunday School teacher, &amp; even in
         later <br /> years, when her infermities would have <br /> proved a sufficient excuse for refusing <br /> she undertook the Bible Class, when a <br /> difficulty of supply was experienced.
         She <br /> became also a faithful and valueddis <br /> trict visitor, first in the <a href="#mlpla000164.html">Parish of S<sup>t</sup> James</a><br /> under the guidance of the <a
            href=".html">Rev<sup>d</sup> T T Beddulph</a><br /> and afterward in the <a href="#mlpla000165.html">Parish of S<sup>t</sup> Michael</a><br />Failing health alone compelled her to <br />
         relinquish these duties, which she had <br /> performed during many years with <br /> conscientious regularlity. She took deep <br /> interest also in the work of the Bible Society<br /> and
         faithfully filled the office of Association <br /> Secretary to the end of her life. In conjunc <br /> tion with the general work of the Bible <br /> Society, she watched with especial
         interest<br /> the origin and growth of the branch <br /> connected with the Brethrens Congrega <br /> tion in <a href="#mlpla000030.html">Bristol</a> of which her revered<br /> Father had
         been treasurer. These were <br /> labours of love invigorating her spiritual </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> life, and with drawing her mind from <br /> dwelling too much upon her peculiar <br /> tendency
         to despondency to which her <br />nervous constitution made her constantly <br /> liable. But it was especially to the <br /> advancement of the Brethrens Mission <br /> in connection with
         this Congregation<br /> that she devoted her strength both of body <br /> &amp; mind. Her persevering self denying <br /> labours in behalf of this great work <br /> will not easily be
         forgotten. For upwards <br /> of 30 years dating from the early part <br /> of  <a href="#mlper000541.html">B<sup>r </sup>Ramftler</a>'s ministry in this <br /> place, she held the office of
         Secretary <br /> of the Ladies Association, an office which <br /> she filled with increasing delight<br /> &amp; increasing efficiency. In the last <br /> year of her life she would gladly
         have <br /> resigned it into younger &amp; stronger <br /> hands, but her services were too valuable <br /> to be lost and she was though with <br /> difficulty, persuaded to continue them
         <br /> And never did her energies flag <br /> never with drooping health did she <br /> omit any effort to increase the efficiency </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> of the branch under her charge to add
         <br /> to the comforts of the Missionaries or to <br /> extend the sphere of their labours. <br /> Her knowledge of the special circum <br /> stances of various Mission Stations <br />
         especially those of the <a href="#mlpla000167.html">West Indies</a><br /> and the peculiar difficulties which <br />Missionaries have to encounter, was <br /> enlarged by an extensive
         correspondence <br /> which she held with those devoted<br /> servants of <a href=".html">God</a>; and this intimate <br /> knowledge of their state she turned <br /> to good account by
         enlisting for them <br /> the sympathise of children of <a href=".html">God</a> in <br /> the various Christian denominations <br /> around her. She has ceased from her <br />blessed labours
         but her works follow <br /> her and in many a distant land <br /> the announcement of her death will <br /> be received with heartfeltsorrow. <br /> May the Lord of the Vineyard raise <br />
         up from this Congregation, a suitable <br /> and devoted successor. These were evi <br /> dences external to herself that she was <br /> in possession of true saving Faith </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p>
         which in seasons of temptation she <br />sometimes doubted. She loved the Lords<br /> people of every name and she had a <br />heart ever ready to sympathise in their joys &amp; sorrows</p>
      <p> To her own Church, she was warmlyat <br /> tached. Few have possessed the true <br />Brethrens spirit in a larger degree <br /> She loved the pious practices &amp; habits of <br /> her
         Forefathers, she opposed innovation, <br /> she sorrowed much over what seemed <br /> to her a declension from the good old ways <br /> which so beautifully distinguish her Church <br /> from
         other less favoured Christian bodies <br /> Several papers were found in her desk <br /> in which she had expressed her feelings <br /> on these subjects </p>
      <p> Nevertheless she ferventlyloved the people <br /> of <a href=".html">God</a> amongst whom her lot was cast, <br /> They were the people of her choice &amp; <br /> her Church was to her as
         her earthly <br /> home. It was the strength of her love<br /> &amp; attachment to the Brethrens Church, <br /> which made her peculiarly sensitive<br /> as to any change in its rites &amp;
         customs </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> In <em>1852</em> her venerable &amp; beloved Father was <br /> removed from her by sudden death. <br /> The shock which her nervous system re <br /> ceived by this
         event, she never fully re <br /> covered, the great enemy of Souls took <br /> advantage of her weak state to strengthen <br /> old doubts and fears and to infuse new <br /> ones, so that she
         was at times led to <br /> question whether she had ever escperienced <br /> real saving grace. Her condition for a <br /> time was most unhappy it was evi <br /> dently in a great degree the
         result <br /> of a morbid state of the nervous system <br /> &amp; excessive bodily weakness. But as her <br />heath gradually improved, she was en <br /> abbled to overcome these temptations
         to <br />despondency and to prove more than <br /> conqueror through Him that loved her. <br /> In <em>1860</em> her health received another shock <br /> by the fracture of a leg, whilst on a
         visit <br /> at <a href="#mlpla000169.html">Calne</a>. Under this severe affection, she <br /> manifested the true spirit of the child <br /> of <a href=".html">God</a> by her extreme
         patience &amp; resignation <br /> Indeed all these troubles seemed to ripen <br /> her for her heavenly home. She even spoke </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> of the state of her soul with humility<br />
         and fear, but her faith and love were <br /> growing stronger &amp; stronger. </p>
      <p> In reference to her illness at <a href="#mlpla000169.html">Calne</a> she wrote <br /> thus, I feel that I must be satisfied to be <br /> an invalid, but it is all right, I feel more <br />
         about it for my dear sympathising friends <br /> than for myself. I only want the work &amp; <br />grace of <a href=".html">Christ</a> to be more manifested <br /> within me &amp; by me and
         my coldness<br /> &amp; deadness to be absorbed in the warmth<br /> and life of <a href=".html">Christ</a>. Again she wrote in <br /> prospect of a change for her healths sake: <br /> "It may
         do me good if the Lordplease, <br /> but I wish to leave it without any anxiety<br /> &amp; without a choice, I expect to go halting <br /> to the end of my days, but I trust a <br />cheerful
         mind &amp; patience will be given <br /> me." Though so long a sufferer, her death <br /> seemed to come suddenly. <em>In the summer <br /> of 1862</em> she had spent four happy weeks <br />
         with her Brother &amp; Sister in the <a href="#mlpla000072.html">North <br /> of England</a> who accompanied her to <br /><a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulnec</a></p>
      <p> She was always cheerful, delighted</p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> to meet old friends, but withat indica <br /> ting great bodily weakness, &amp; great difficult <br /> ly breathing. </p>
      <p> On the way homewards she paid a week <br /> visit to a dear &amp; valued friend in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Staffordshire.html">Stafford <br /> shire</a>. </p>
      <p> On her arrival at home, she seemed ra <br /> ther improved in health than otherwise <br /> by her long journey. But as the winter <br /> advanced increased symptoms of weak <br /> less
         appeared especially in the re <br /> gion of the heart &amp; the lung. </p>
      <p> Kind friends were around her one <br /> especially watched over tenderly &amp; an <br /> xiously until the close of life. She received <br /> also the incessant attention of an attach <br />
         ed servant who had lived in her family <br /> more than 20 years </p>
      <p> But <a href=".html">God</a> had thoughts of peace con <br /> cerning her. She had at times ex <br /> pressed fears of death, but she never <br /> knew what death was, she departed <br /> in
         sleep. </p>
      <p> The above is a sketch of a very unevent <br /> ful life, but yet one of unususal christi </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> an activity. She possessed a strong <br /> mind in a very weak body. Her
         love<br /> for <a href=".html">Christ</a> and for <a href=".html">Christ's</a> people was <br /> great, and her labours in His cause <br /> were unremitting. She now rests in <br />peace, she
         has realized what she wrote <br /> in <em>1860</em> concerning a happily depart <br /> ed and beloved Sister in <a href=".html">Christ</a>. "The <br />beloved Saint is with <a href=".html"
            >Christ</a>, no longer <br /> clad in weakness, and faint with suf <br /> fering, but clothed in the bright robes <br /> &amp; our Saviour's righteousness, and <br />rejoicing in the
         presence of <a href=".html">God</a> for <br /> ever" We may truly say this of <br /> herself, she is with that Saviour, for <br /> whom she felt it an honour to labour <br /> Friends will
         indeed mourn &amp; her <br /> place on earth may not easily be <br /> filled up, but we cannot wish to <br /> bring her back, we would withdraw <br /> her an instant from the presence of
         <br /> Him, with whom there is fulness <br /> of joy &amp; life for ever more. <br /> H. W. M. </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> A few loving words of remembrance are <br /> added to the above by one whose
         intimate <br /> association with the beloved Subject of <br /> this little sketch, renders it a most <br /> touching but filial duty to add her testimony <br /> of deep appreciation of and
         respect for the <br /> character of one, so justly endeared to all <br /> who had the privilege of her intimate <br /> friendship, and perhaps none of those <br /> who now tenderlymourn her
         loss can <br /> speak of the departed, with so much real <br /> knowledge of her both as an individual <br /> &amp; a Christian having shared the same <br /> home for 13 or 14 years. Her
         mental <br /> powers were of no common order. She <br /> possessed naturally an unusual <br /> amount of sound judgment fortitude <br /> &amp; self sacrificing generosity as well as <br />
         consistancy of action, together with a <br /> true ardour &amp; depth of affection, which <br /> when once bestowed, was rarely if ever <br /> withdrawn. As a Christian her light <br /> shone
         with unwavering steadfastness, <br /> though a feeble body and of late shattered </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> nerves, often beclouding her otherwise <br /> strong mind, giving a morbid tone <br /> to
         her own expressions concerning her <br /> spiritual experience, but to those who <br /> had before them such an undeviating <br /> pattern of consistancy there remained <br /> nothing, but
         the precept / speaking <br /> by example / "Go ye and do likewise" <br /> Her humility before <a href=".html">God</a> was a marked <br /> feature of her high attainments in <br /> the
         Christian life. In her last letter <br /> to the writer of those few lines she says <br /> I feel a mass of sin &amp; weakness: but <br /> follows on to say, that the all wise, bur <br /> den
         bearer will enable her to cast it <br /> all on Him. Nearness to her Saviour<br /> was the one thing her soul most <br />ardentlycraved. About two months <br /> ago she wrote. "Do pray dear
         that the <br />Lord may be more near than ever <br /> He is very gracious, but I want to see <br /> Him face to face, to touch Him as <br /> it were." To these remarks little need <br /> be
         added to prove that though her <br /> spiritual life was a warfire, Yet </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> that in the apostle's words her weapons <br /> were not carnal but mighty through <br /><a
            href=".html">God</a> to the pulling down of strongholds. <br /> Of a truth she was clad in the armour <br /> of <a href=".html">God</a> and her spirit was found <br /> ready waiting When
         she for the <br /> last time unconsciously closed her <br /> eyes in sleep to wake in that glorious <br /> world, where conflict &amp; strife &amp; suffering<br /> are known no more. </p>
      <p> The Church of which our beloved<br /> one was so devoted a member, has <br /> paid its tribute to the worthiness of one <br /> of its brightest ornaments. Yea her <br /> works do follow her.
         And we must <br /> add from our own knowledge that <br /> its glorious Missionary Society has lost <br /> in this place its most energetic and <br /> painstaking supporter. Neither were
         <br /> her efforts confined alone to the Moravian <br /> Church, but her well grounded and <br />large hearted Christianity taught <br /> her that wherever good was to be <br /> done &amp;
         she felt called upon to give her </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p> aid. Hither she went and with all <br /> her power &amp; even beyond her power work <br /> ed with lovingzeal in her Masters <br /> cause.
         Mongst the rest the Ladies <br /> Association of the British &amp; Foreign <br /> Bible Society would warmly respond <br /> to the acknowledgment of her most <br /> valuable and long
         continued <br /> help. The Lord ordereth all things <br /> well for His children, &amp; it is a comfort <br /> ing thought that this dear Servant <br /> of <a href=".html">God</a> who so
         often ministered to the <br /> bids of others, was also herself abundant <br /> ly comforted both by her intimate <br /> relatives and friends as well as <br /> by her Brethren &amp; Sisters
         in Christ <br /> and it is especieelly sweet to think <br /> that for the last fortnight one was <br /> constantly beside her administering <br /> with tendersolicitude to her every
         <br />want. These services were continu <br /> ally acknowledged, as were those <br /> of her faithful servant who has serv <br /> ed her with an affectionateinterest<br /> for a period of 20
         years. May she </p>PAGE BREAK 
      
      <p>Lord reward them, &amp; give to them <br /> &amp; us the answer to those prayers <br /> which the dear departed so earnest <br /> ly and believingly offered
         on their <br /> and our behalf, until we all meet <br /> in the mansions prepared in our <br /> Father's home in heaven </p>
